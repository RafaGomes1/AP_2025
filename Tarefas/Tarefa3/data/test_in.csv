D1-1	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA polymerase plays a pivotal role in the replication process. This enzyme, a key player in the life cycle of all organisms, traverses the double helix, unwinding it while simultaneously synthesizing new strands. It reads the template strand, forming a new complementary strand, akin to typing from a book while writing a mirror copy. This intricate dance of synthesis ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. DNA polymerase, in essence, is the librarian of life, meticulously maintaining the archive of genetic codes that govern all living organisms.
D1-2	Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.
D1-3	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. It involves the green pigment chlorophyll, which absorbs light, and carbon dioxide, water, and minerals from the soil. The conversion process results in the creation of glucose, a simple sugar for energy, and oxygen, a vital component for respiration in most life forms. This symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere is a testament to the harmony that underpins our ecosystem.
D1-4	Both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate the repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway. In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable, at least in cultured cells. In this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational evidence. We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally determined human miRNAs. This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous miRNAs.
D1-5	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized molecular biology. This revolutionary tool allows for precise editing of DNA sequences, opening doors to potential therapeutic applications and genetic engineering. By exploiting the adaptive immune system of bacteria, scientists can now cut, copy, and paste segments of DNA with unprecedented accuracy. This technology holds immense promise for combating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even modifying the traits of organisms. However, as with any powerful technology, the ethical implications must be carefully considered, ensuring responsible and safe use for the betterment of humanity.
D1-6	We study general aspects of active motion with fluctuations in the speed and the direction of motion in two dimensions. We consider the case in which fluctuations in the speed are not correlated to fluctuations in the direction of motion, and assume that both processes can be described by independent characteristic time-scales. We show the occurrence of a complex transient that can exhibit a series of alternating regimes of motion, for two different angular dynamics which correspond to persistent and directed random walks. We also show additive corrections to the diffusion coefficient. The characteristic time-scales are also exposed in the velocity autocorrelation, which is a sum of exponential forms.
D1-7	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequencing, determines the functional activity of genes without altering the underlying DNA code. It's a complex dance of proteins and chemical tags that control gene expression, influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. Epigenetic changes can be reversible, offering potential for therapeutic interventions, especially in conditions linked to aberrant gene expression, like cancer. This fascinating field bridges the gap between nature and nurture, underscoring the dynamic interplay between our genetic inheritance and the external influences that shape our health and development.
D1-8	We study the length distribution of a particular class of DNA sequences known as 5'UTR exons. These exons belong to the messanger RNA of protein coding genes, but they are not coding (they are located upstream of the coding portion of the mRNA) and are thus less constrained from an evolutionary point of view. We show that both in mouse and in human these exons show a very clean power law decay in their length distribution and suggest a simple evolutionary model which may explain this finding. We conjecture that this power law behaviour could indeed be a general feature of higher eukaryotes.
D1-9	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the fascinating realm of DNA methylation. This process, a crucial epigenetic modification, serves as a molecular switch, regulating gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Methyl groups, small molecules derived from dietary sources, are added to the DNA structure, thus changing its accessibility to transcription factors, and ultimately determining which genes are active or silenced. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cellular differentiation, embryonic development, and tumor suppression, offering profound insights into the complexities of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-10	We used the atomic force microscope to manipulate and unfold individual molecules of the titin I27 domain and reconstructed its free energy surface using Jarzynski's equality. The free energy surface for both stretching and unfolding was reconstructed using an exact formula that relates the nonequilibrium work fluctuations to the molecular free energy. In addition, the unfolding free energy barrier, i.e. the activation energy, was directly obtained from experimental data for the first time. This work demonstrates that Jarzynski's equality can be used to analyze nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments, and to obtain the free energy surfaces for molecular systems, including interactions for which only nonequilibrium work can be measured.
D1-11	 In the intricate dance of life, the process of photosynthesis stands as a testament to nature's efficiency. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness solar energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This biochemical marvel unfolds in chloroplasts, the green powerhouses within plant cells. During daylight hours, these organelles absorb sunlight, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide, sourced from the air or the plant itself, to create glucose. This vital energy source fuels the plant's growth, while the oxygen enriches our atmosphere, sustaining life on Earth. Photosynthesis, therefore, is not just a biological phenomenon. it's a lifeline that binds all living things in a shared, sun-kissed symphony of survival.
D1-12	The maintainance of a stable periodicity during the yeast metabolic cycle involving approximately half of the genome requires a very strict and efficient control of gene expression. For this reason, the metabolic cycle is a very good candidate for testing the role of a class of post-transcriptional regulators, the so called PUF-family, whose genome-wide mRNA binding specificity was recently experimentally assessed. Here we show that an integrated computational analysis of gene expression time series during the metabolic cycle and the mRNA binding specificity of PUF-family proteins allow for a clear demonstration of the very specific role exerted by selective post-transcriptional mRNA degradation in yeast metabolic cycle global regulation.
D1-13	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed as the powerhouses of the cell, are integral to life. They are membrane-bound organelles responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells, through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria also play a crucial role in programmed cell death, a mechanism that ensures the body can regulate cell growth and prevent uncontrolled proliferation. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA, which carries genes essential for their structure and function. This double membrane-enclosed organelle, with its intricate biological functions, is a testament to the complex and interconnected nature of cellular life.
D1-14	Chemical reaction systems with a low to moderate number of molecules are typically modeled as discrete jump Markov processes. These systems are oftentimes simulated with methods that produce statistically exact sample paths such as the Gillespie Algorithm or the Next Reaction Method. In this paper we make explicit use of the fact that the initiation times of the reactions can be represented as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes with internal times given by integrated propensity functions. Using this representation we derive a modified Next Reaction Method and, in a way that achieves efficiency over existing approaches for exact simulation, extend it to systems with time dependent propensities as well as to systems with delays.
D1-15	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a profound testament to evolution's adaptive genius. This mutualistic relationship, where two different species live in close proximity, often to the advantage of both, is a biological phenomenon of great significance. Consider the relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, single-celled algae residing within coral tissues. Through photosynthesis, these algae provide the coral with essential nutrients, while the coral offers the algae a protected environment and access to sunlight. This symbiotic alliance not only ensures the survival of both species but also contributes significantly to the health and diversity of marine ecosystems, serving as a vibrant example of the harmonious interplay between life forms.
D1-16	This paper describes a design of a molecular propagation system in molecular communication. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where biological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short distance using molecules. A molecular propagation system in molecular communication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design described in this paper, protein filaments glide over immobilized motor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and the gliding protein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and from the carriers at a sender and a receiver. In the design, loading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external control.
D1-17	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges, a field that delves into the structural changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, influence gene activity and can be affected by various factors like age, environment, and lifestyle choices. These modifications play a vital role in cellular processes, from development and growth to disease prevention and treatment. Epigenetic studies are revolutionizing our understanding of hereditary traits, potentially offering new avenues for disease management and personalized medicine.
D1-18	"Schizophrenia is a severe, currently incurable, relatively common mental condition. Its symptoms are complex and widespread. It structurally and functionally affects cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects of behavior. Its cause is unknown, its diagnosis is based on statistical behavior and its treatment is elusive.   Our paradigm addresses the complexity of schizophrenic symptoms. Building upon recent neural vulnerability and limbic dysregulation hypotheses, it offers a mathematical model for the evolution of the limbic system under perturbation. Dependence on parameters and the concept of ""bifurcation"" could be the key to understanding the threshold between ""normality"" and ""disease""."
D1-19	 In botany, the process of photosynthesis is a marvel of nature, a symphony of life's building blocks. Under the sun's radiant glow, chlorophyll, the green pigment in plant cells, absorbs light energy. This energy is harnessed to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed and incorporated into glucose, a simple sugar, via the Calvin cycle. This process, essential for life on Earth, not only sustains the plant but also provides oxygen for all aerobic organisms and serves as the primary food source for heterotrophic life forms. Thus, photosynthesis is an intricate dance of elements, an unyielding engine of life that underpins the health of our planet.
D1-20	An analytical description of the response properties of simple but realistic neuron models in the presence of noise is still lacking. We determine completely up to the second order the firing statistics of a single and a pair of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (LIFs) receiving some common slowly filtered white noise. In particular, the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the output spike trains of pairs of cells are obtained from an improvement of the adiabatic approximation introduced in Mor+04. These two functions define the firing variability and firing synchronization between neurons, and are of much importance for understanding neuron communication.
D1-21	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, a symphony of chemistry orchestrated by plants and photosynthetic organisms. This miracle of nature converts sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only fuels the organisms themselves but also sustains the atmosphere, providing the essential oxygen that animals, including humans, require for respiration. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a vital link in the web of life, underpinning the very existence of countless species on our planet.
D1-22	A description for regulatory genetic network based on generalized potential energy is constructed. The potential energy is derived from the steady state solution of linearized Fokker-Plank equation, and the result is shown to be equivalent to the system of coupled oscillators. The correspondence between the quantities from the mechanical picture and the steady-state fluctuations is established. Explicit calculation is given for auto-regulatory networks in which, the force constant associated with the degree of protein is very weak. Negative feedback not only suppresses the fluctuations but also increases the steepness of the potential. The results for the fluctuations agree completely with those obtained from linear noise Fokker-Planck equation.
D1-23	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, a symphony of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and light. This process, performed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen sustains countless organisms, while glucose serves as a vital energy source. Photosynthesis's efficiency is crucial to maintaining the balance of Earth's atmosphere, ensuring the survival of diverse life forms and the planet's biosphere. This biological marvel, through its intricate mechanisms, underpins the very foundations of life on Earth.
D1-24	We show how accurate kinetic information, such as the rates of protein folding and unfolding, can be extracted from replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. From the brief and continuous trajectory segments between replica exchanges, we estimate short-time propagators in conformation space and use them to construct a master equation. For a helical peptide in explicit water, we determine the rates of transitions both locally between microscopic conformational states and globally for folding and unfolding. We show that accurate rates in the ~1/(100 ns) to ~1/(1 ns) range can be obtained from REMD with exchange times of 5 ps, in excellent agreement with results from long equilibrium molecular dynamics.
D1-25	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent deep-sea anglerfish is a captivating spectacle. This enigmatic creature, adapted to the dark abyss, emits a eerie glow produced by a light-producing organ called photophore. The anglerfish's dorsal fin sports a luminescent lure, which it uses to attract unsuspecting prey towards its gaping mouth. The anglerfish's unique lifestyle, characterized by extreme pressure, scant food, and a life-altering mating ritual, exemplifies the remarkable adaptations found in deep-sea organisms. Despite its ominous appearance, the anglerfish serves as a symbol of resilience and survival in one of Earth's most inhospitable environments.
D1-26	The development of a large non-coding fraction in eukaryotic DNA and the phenomenon of the code-bloat in the field of evolutionary computations show a striking similarity. This seems to suggest that (in the presence of mechanisms of code growth) the evolution of a complex code can't be attained without maintaining a large inactive fraction. To test this hypothesis we performed computer simulations of an evolutionary toy model for Turing machines, studying the relations among fitness and coding/non-coding ratio while varying mutation and code growth rates. The results suggest that, in our model, having a large reservoir of non-coding states constitutes a great (long term) evolutionary advantage.
D1-27	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA, the hereditary molecule, assumes a pivotal role. It's a double helix, a twisted ladder of nucleotides, each bearing a phosphate-sugar backbone and a nitrogenous base. Adenine pairs with thymine, while cytosine links with guanine, maintaining the ladder's integrity. This genetic code, encoded within DNA, is translated into proteins by messenger RNA, which serves as an intermediary. These proteins, the workhorses of the cell, carry out the myriad functions essential for life, from enzymatic catalysis to structural support. Thus, DNA and proteins form a symbiotic dance, the very essence of life's intricate choreography.
D1-28	Population stratification is a problem encountered in several areas of biology and public health. We tackle this problem by mapping a population and its elements attributes into a hypergraph, a natural extension of the concept of graph or network to encode associations among any number of elements. On this hypergraph, we construct a statistical model reflecting our intuition about how the elements attributes can emerge from a postulated population structure. Finally, we introduce the concept of stratification representativeness as a mean to identify the simplest stratification already containing most of the information about the population structure. We demonstrate the power of this framework stratifying an animal and a human population based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, respectively.
D1-29	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or firefly squid, is a captivating creature. Found in the deep ocean's twilight zone, these squid emit a soft, blue-green glow, a result of a chemical reaction in a light-producing organ called the photophore. This natural lantern serves multiple purposes, from camouflage during predator attacks to communication and mate attraction. The bioluminescent squid's unique traits offer researchers valuable insights into the mysteries of life in the deep sea, shedding light on the evolutionary adaptations necessary for survival in the dark abyss.

The present study investigates retrieval of time series objects from a phoneme database to a given user pattern or query. The proposed method maps the one-dimensional time series retrieval into a sequence retrieval problem by partitioning the multi-dimensional phase-space using k-means clustering. The problem of whole sequence as well as subsequence matching is considered. Robustness of the proposed technique is investigated on phoneme time series corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. The shortcoming of classical power-spectral techniques for time series retrieval is also discussed.

This technology holds immense potential, from correcting genetic diseases to enhancing crops for food security. It's a leap forward in our understanding and manipulation of life's blueprint, promising a future where we can eradicate disease, improve agriculture, and even tackle climate change at its roots. Yet, the ethical implications are profound, as the power to rewrite life's code raises questions about the boundaries of human intervention and the potential consequences for future generations. The age of gene editing is here, ushering in a new era of scientific exploration and ethical debate.
D1-32	The peculiarity of the distribution and geometry of metallic ions in enzymes pushed us to set the hypothesis that metallic ions in active-site act like tiny antennas able to pick up very feeble e.m. signals. Enzymatic activity of Cu2+, Zn2+ Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) and Fe2+ Xanthine Oxidase (XO) has been studied, following in vitro generation and removal of free radicals. We observed that Superoxide radicals generation by XO is increased by a weak field having the Larmor frequency fL of Fe2+ while the SOD1 kinetics is sensibly reduced by exposure to a weak field having the frequency fL of Cu2+ ion.
D1-33	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a fundamental process carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical reaction harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, effectively sustaining life on Earth. The green pigment chlorophyll, found in chloroplasts, acts as a solar panel, absorbing light and powering the transformation of carbon dioxide into glucose. This process not only fuels the organisms themselves but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, a vital component for most aerobic life forms. Thus, photosynthesis, in its simplicity, encapsulates the interconnectedness and harmony of life on our planet.
D1-34	The understanding of inactivation radiobiological mechanism in individual cells is important when from one side the application of ionizing radiation to tumour therapy and from the other side the protection against radiation are to be effectively improved. Important part of this mechanism is double-strand break (DSB) formation. these DSB may be formed directly by impacting ionizing particles or indirectly by different secondary radicals. The latter kind of formation is much more frequent when cells contain normal water content. Mathematical model of the corresponding chemical stage will be presented with the aim to demonstrate how the individual radicals, but also other chemical agents present in the water during irradiation may influence DSB formation.
D1-35	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minor changes in DNA sequence, often occurring at gene boundaries, can lead to a variety of effects, from subtle differences in eye color to more profound alterations in disease susceptibility. SNPs are crucial in understanding genetic diversity, evolution, and the mapping of genes responsible for hereditary diseases. Though individual SNPs may appear insignificant, their collective impact on genetic expression can shape the course of life at the molecular level. This knowledge can open doors to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, paving the way for a future where healthcare is tailored to the unique genetic makeup of each individual.
D1-36	A recent problem in community ecology lies in defining structures behind matrices of species interactions. The interest in this area is to quantify the nestedness degree of the matrix after its maximal packing. In this work we evaluate nestedness using the sum of all distances of the occupied sites to the vertex of the matrix. We calculate the distance for two artificial matrices with the same size and occupancy: a random matrix and a perfect nested one. Using these two benchmarks we develop a nestedness estimator. The estimator is applied to a set of 23 real networks of insect-plant interactions.

Its intelligence is unparalleled among invertebrates, revealing complex problem-solving skills and the ability to change color and texture for camouflage. These enigmatic creatures possess a brief lifespan yet manage to captivate us with their mesmerizing dance in the deep ocean's abyss. Their mysterious beauty underscores the wonders that still await us in the unexplored depths of our planet's aquatic realms.
D1-38	The design of large libraries of oligonucleotides having constant GC-content and satisfying Hamming distance constraints between oligonucleotides and their Watson-Crick complements is important in reducing hybridization errors in DNA computing, DNA microarray technologies, and molecular bar coding. Various techniques have been studied for the construction of such oligonucleotide libraries, ranging from algorithmic constructions via stochastic local search to theoretical constructions via coding theory. We introduce a new stochastic local search method which yields improvements up to more than one third of the benchmark lower bounds of Gaborit and King (2005) for n-mer oligonucleotide libraries when n <= 14. We also found several optimal libraries by computing maximum cliques on certain graphs.
D1-39	 In marine ecosystems, the symbiotic relationship between sea anemones and anemonefish is a captivating display of mutualism. Anemonefish, armed with a mucous layer that ensures immunity against the potentially lethal anemone's tentacles, reside within the anemone's protective tentacles. In return, the anemone gains from the fish's waste, which serves as a natural food source. This alliance provides both species with enhanced survival and reproductive success, showcasing the intricate web of interdependence that thrives within diverse marine environments.
D1-40	"{\it Transcription} is the process whereby RNA molecules are polymerized by molecular machines, called RNA polymerase (RNAP), using the corresponding DNA as the template. Recent {\it in-vivo} experiments with single cells have established that transcription takes place in ""bursts"" or ""pulses"". In this letter we present a model that captures not only the mechano-chemistry of individual RNAPs and their steric interactions but also the switching of the gene between the ON and OFF states. This model accounts for the statistical properties of the transcriptional bursts. It also shows how the quantitative features of the distributions of these bursts can be tuned by controlling the appropriate steps of operation of the RNAP machines."
D1-41	 In the captivating realm of genetics, the intricate dance between DNA sequences and protein production is a dynamic symphony. Genes, the fundamental units of heredity, are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for protein synthesis. They act as blueprints, coding for specific amino acids to be assembled into protein structures.

D1-42	A mechanism of extraction of tubular membranes from a lipid vesicle is presented. A concentration gradient of anchoring amphiphilic polymers generates tubes from bud-like vesicle protrusions. We explain this mechanism in the framework of the Canham-Helfrich model. The energy profile is analytically calculated and a tube with a fixed length, corresponding to an energy minimum, is obtained in a certain regime of parameters. Further, using a phase-field model, we corroborate these results numerically. We obtain the growth of tubes when a polymer source is added, and the bud-like shape after removal of the polymer source, in accordance with recent experimental results.

D1-44	Proliferating cell populations at steady state growth often exhibit broad protein distributions with exponential tails. The sources of this variation and its universality are of much theoretical interest. Here we address the problem by asymptotic analysis of the Population Balance Equation. We show that the steady state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein production and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under general conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters consistent with experiment. We discuss the conditions for this effect to be dominant over other sources of variation and the relation to experiments.

Yet, the ethical implications are vast and complex, necessitating careful consideration of potential risks, such as unintended consequences on ecosystems and the possibility of designing 'designer babies'. As we navigate this frontier, striking a balance between scientific progress and ethical responsibility becomes paramount.
D1-46	We study the effect of permeabilizing electric fields applied to two different types of giant unilamellar vesicles, the first formed from EggPC lipids and the second formed from DOPC lipids. Experiments on vesicles of both lipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due to lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in size can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is proportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized. Three possible mechanisms responsible for lipid loss were directly observed: pore formation, vesicle formation and tubule formation.
D1-47	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a game-changer. This system, derived from bacterial immunity, allows for precise editing of DNA sequences. By using a guide RNA to locate specific genes, and an enzyme to cut and repair the DNA, scientists can introduce targeted modifications.

D1-48	We study the spreading of excitations in 2D systems of mobile agents where the excitation is transmitted when a quiescent agent keeps contact with an excited one during a non-vanishing time. We show that the steady states strongly depend on the spatial agent dynamics. Moreover, the coupling between exposition time ($\omega$) and agent-agent contact rate (CR) becomes crucial to understand the excitation dynamics, which exhibits three regimes with CR: no excitation for low CR, an excited regime in which the number of quiescent agents (S) is inversely proportional to CR, and for high CR, a novel third regime, model dependent, here S scales with an exponent $\xi -1$, with $\xi$ being the scaling exponent of $\omega$ with CR.
D1-49	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble fungi play a pivotal role, often unnoticed. Being neither plant nor animal, they belong to their own kingdom, mycota. Fungi, with their thread-like hyphae, form vast underground networks known as mycorrhizae, enhancing nutrient uptake for plants and facilitating soil structure. Some fungi also decompose organic matter, aiding in the recycling of essential elements. Mushrooms, the fruiting bodies of fungi, are the visible manifestation of this hidden world, offering a glimpse into the silent symphony of decay and renewal that sustains our ecosystem. Despite their small stature, fungi's influence on the planet is immeasurable, underscoring the interconnectedness of all life forms.
D1-50	In forced polymer translocation, the average translocation time, $\tau$, scales with respect to pore force, $f$, and polymer length, $N$, as $\tau \sim f^{-1} N^{\beta}$. We demonstrate that an artifact in Metropolis Monte Carlo method resulting in breakage of the force scaling with large $f$ may be responsible for some of the controversies between different computationally obtained results and also between computational and experimental results. Using Langevin dynamics simulations we show that the scaling exponent $\beta \le 1 + \nu$ is not universal, but depends on $f$. Moreover, we show that forced translocation can be described by a relatively simple force balance argument and $\beta$ to arise solely from the initial polymer configuration.
D1-51	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, Dinofelis megalei, is an intriguing creature. It dwells in the deep-sea abyss, where light scarcity is the norm. This cephalopod possesses light-emitting organs, known as photophores, which emit flashes of blue-green light to communicate, confuse predators, or attract prey. Interestingly, D. megalei's bioluminescence is not self-generated but relies on symbiotic bacteria called Vibrio fisheri. These bacteria produce light when oxygen is introduced, a process harnessed by the squid to create its captivating display of light. This symbiotic relationship, a testament to nature's diversity and complexity, remains a fascinating subject for ongoing scientific exploration.
D1-52	"In parametric sequence alignment, optimal alignments of two sequences are computed as a function of the penalties for mismatches and spaces, producing many different optimal alignments. Here we give a 3/(2^{7/3}\pi^{2/3})n^{2/3} +O(n^{1/3} \log n) lower bound on the maximum number of distinct optimal alignment summaries of length-n binary sequences. This shows that the upper bound given by Gusfield et. al. is tight over all alphabets, thereby disproving the ""square root of n conjecture"". Thus the maximum number of distinct optimal alignment summaries (i.e. vertices of the alignment polytope) over all pairs of length-n sequences is Theta(n^{2/3})."
D1-53	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis serves as a cornerstone, the green pulse that sustains our world. This biochemical process, executed primarily by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The photosynthetic equation, while seemingly simple, embodies the extraordinary efficiency and harmony of nature: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy = C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. This conversion not only fuels the growth of the organism but also enriches the atmosphere with life-sustaining oxygen, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and the air we breathe.
D1-54	We propose a principle of consistency between different hierarchical levels of biological systems. Given a consistency between molecule replication and cell reproduction, universal statistical laws on cellular chemical abundances are derived and confirmed experimentally. They include a power law distribution of gene expressions, a lognormal distribution of cellular chemical abundances over cells, and embedding of the power law into the network connectivity distribution. Second, given a consistency between genotype and phenotype, a general relationship between phenotype fluctuations by genetic variation and isogenic phenotypic fluctuation by developmental noise is derived. Third, we discuss the chaos mechanism for stem cell differentiation with autonomous regulation, resulting from a consistency between cell reproduction and growth of the cell ensemble.

These creatures, such as the anglerfish or the dinoflagellates, produce light through a chemical reaction within their bodies. This light serves various purposes, including attracting prey, deterring predators, or communication. The process involves a luciferin molecule reacting with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, emitting light as a byproduct. This phenomenon not only adds a mesmerizing touch to the dark abyss of the ocean depths but also sheds light on the intricate and diverse adaptations of marine life.

This Resource Letter serves as a guide to the literature on nano-machines which drive not only intracellular movements, but also motility of the cell. These machines are usually proteins or macromolecular assemblies which require appropriate fuel for their operations. Although, traditionally, these machines were subjects of investigation in biology and biochemistry, increasing use of the concepts and techniques of physics in recent years have contributed to the quantitative understanding of the fundamental principles underlying their operational mechanisms. The possibility of exploiting these principles for the design and control of artificial nano-machines has opened up a new frontier in the bottom-up approach to nano-technology.
D1-57	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the DNA double helix is a beacon of life's complexity. This molecular giant, coiled within the nucleus of every cell, is the blueprint for all living things. Each DNA strand, a twin of sugar and phosphate, carries the four fundamental nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair up, forming rungs on the helical ladder, with adenine always connecting to thymine, and guanine to cytosine. The sequence of these bases, a unique code for every organism, dictates the instructions for protein synthesis, shaping the myriad forms and functions of life.

D1-58	We investigate the protein expression pattern of the lamB gene in Escherichia coli LE392. The gene product LamB is an important membrane protein for maltose transport into cells but it is also exploited by bacteriophage lambda for infection. Although our bacterial population is clonal, stochastic gene expression leads to a majority population with a large receptor number and a minority population with a small receptor number. We find that the LamB receptor distribution p(n) of the small-n population is scale invariant with the exponent depending on growth conditions. A heuristic model is proposed that relates the observed exponent to the protein production rate.
D1-59	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble honeybee plays a pivotal role. As a keystone pollinator, these industrious insects aid in the fertilization of plants, ensuring the continuation of various ecosystems. Their foraging journey involves gathering nectar and pollen, transferring pollen grains from one flower to another in the process. This cross-pollination is crucial for plant reproduction, making our gardens bloom and our fruits and vegetables grow. Moreover, honeybees produce honey, a natural sweetener with numerous health benefits and cultural significance. Yet, sadly, honeybee populations are declining worldwide due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change. This alarming trend underscores the importance of conserving these vital creatures for the well-being of our planet and ourselves.
D1-60	Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities.

As we delve deeper into altering the building blocks of life, questions about the potential misuse of this power, the line between therapy and enhancement, and the impact on future generations arise. Balancing scientific advancement with moral responsibility is a challenge we must tackle, ensuring that gene editing benefits humanity while respecting the sanctity of life.
D1-62	The two classic theories for the existence of sexual replication are that sex purges deleterious mutations from a population, and that sex allows a population to adapt more rapidly to changing environments. These two theories have often been presented as opposing explanations for the existence of sex. Here, we develop and analyze evolutionary models based on the asexual and sexual replication pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), and show that sexual replication can both purge deleterious mutations in a static environment, as well as lead to faster adaptation in a dynamic environment. This implies that sex can serve a dual role, which is in sharp contrast to previous theories.
D1-63	 In botany, photosynthesis is a fundamental process that sustains life on Earth. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. This intricate biochemical dance occurs within chloroplasts, organelles containing the green pigment chlorophyll. The light-dependent reactions, driven by sunlight, convert water into oxygen and ATP, while the light-independent reactions, the Calvin cycle, use carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH to synthesize glucose. This photosynthetic marvel not only fuels the growth of plants but also supplies the oxygen we breathe and binds carbon dioxide, playing a crucial role in mitigating climate change.
D1-64	A connection is established between discrete stochastic model describing microscopic motion of fluctuating cells, and macroscopic equations describing dynamics of cellular density. Cells move towards chemical gradient (process called chemotaxis) with their shapes randomly fluctuating. Nonlinear diffusion equation is derived from microscopic dynamics in dimensions one and two using excluded volume approach. Nonlinear diffusion coefficient depends on cellular volume fraction and it is demonstrated to prevent collapse of cellular density. A very good agreement is shown between Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic Cellular Potts Model and numerical solutions of the macroscopic equations for relatively large cellular volume fractions. Combination of microscopic and macroscopic models were used to simulate growth of structures similar to early vascular networks.
D1-65	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating subfield. Epigenetics, loosely defined, is the study of changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes are brought about by chemical modifications to DNA or the proteins that wind around it, known as histones. These modifications can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, serving as a bridge between nature and nurture. Epigenetic changes can have profound effects on the development, function, and even the fate of cells, underscoring their potential role in disease susceptibility and treatment strategies.
D1-66	We extend the Saffman theory of membrane hydrodynamics to account for the correlated motion of membrane proteins, along with the effect of protein concentration on that correlation and on the response of the membrane to stresses. Expressions for the coupling diffusion coefficients of protein pairs and their concentration dependence are derived in the limit of small protein size relative to the inter-protein separation. The additional role of membrane viscosity as determining the characteristic length scale for membrane response leads to unusual concentration effects at large separation -- the transverse coupling increases with protein concentration, whereas the longitudinal one becomes concentration-independent.

We found that the dynamics of a MT is mathematically expressed via a cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. Interestingly, the generic 3D solution of the NLS equation exhibits linear growing and shortening in time as well as temporal fluctuations about a mean value which are qualitatively similar to the dynamic instability of MTs observed experimentally. By solving equations numerically, we have found spatio-temporal patterns consistent with experimental observations.
D1-69	 Unraveling the mysteries of DNA replication, we delve into the fascinating process by which our genetic blueprint is duplicated. Within the nucleus of a cell, the double helix unwinds, catalyzed by helicases. Single strands serve as templates for the creation of new complementary strands, synthesized by DNA polymerases using nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. Okazaki fragments, short stretches of nucleotides, are initially synthesized and later linked together by a complex of enzymes known as ligase. The entire process is tightly regulated and orchestrated, ensuring the faithful copying of our genetic information, a vital prerequisite for cell division and growth.
D1-70	We consider an inertial model of chemotactic aggregation generalizing the Keller-Segel model and we study the linear dynamical stability of an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells,...) when inertial effects are accounted for. These inertial terms model cells directional persistance. We determine the condition of instability and the growth rate of the perturbation as a function of the cell density and the wavelength of the perturbation. We discuss the differences between overdamped (Keller-Segel) and inertial models. Finally, we show the analogy between the instability criterion for biological populations and the Jeans instability criterion in astrophysics.
D1-71	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis plays a pivotal role. This harmonious relationship, often seen in coral and algae, orchids and fungi, allows organisms of different species to coexist in mutual benefit. The algae photosynthesize, converting sunlight into energy, while the host provides protection and essential nutrients. This interdependence not only sustains the individual organisms but also contributes significantly to the health and diversity of entire ecosystems. Such symbiotic partnerships underline the fundamental interconnectedness of life on Earth, underscoring the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem preservation.

It allows the calculation of the probability of DNA damage as a result of irradiation of tissues with energetic ions, up to 430 MeV/u. This approach covers different scales, starting from the large scale, defined by the ion stopping, followed by a smaller scale, defined by secondary electrons and radicals, and ending with the shortest scale, defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of DNA, suggest a way to further expand such calculations, and also make some estimates for glial cells exposed to radiation.

D1-74	The inference of gene regulatory networks from high throughput gene expression data is one of the major challenges in systems biology. This paper aims at analysing and comparing two different algorithmic approaches. The first approach uses pairwise correlations between regulated and regulating genes. the second one uses message-passing techniques for inferring activating and inhibiting regulatory interactions. The performance of these two algorithms can be analysed theoretically on well-defined test sets, using tools from the statistical physics of disordered systems like the replica method. We find that the second algorithm outperforms the first one since it takes into account collective effects of multiple regulators.
D1-75	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. It's a symphony of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, orchestrated by chlorophyll within the plant cells. This conversion produces glucose, a primary energy source, and releases oxygen, a vital component for respiration in most organisms. Photosynthesis, thus, is a life-sustaining cycle, fostering the growth of flora and maintaining the Earth's oxygen levels, all while converting the sun's boundless energy into a form usable by living organisms.

By using a random walk-based method, we unveil the modularity of brain-webs, and show that modules with a spatial distribution that matches anatomical structures with functional significance. The functional role of each node in the network is studied by analyzing its patterns of inter- and intra-modular connections. Results suggest that the modular architecture constitutes the structural basis for the coexistence of functional integration of distant and specialized brain areas during normal brain activities at rest.

However, ethical considerations loom large, particularly regarding the possibility of editing human embryos, raising questions about the moral boundaries of genetic modification. As we navigate this brave new world, striking a balance between scientific advancement and ethical responsibility becomes paramount.
D1-78	Mechanical oscillations are important for many cellular processes, e.g. the beating of cilia and flagella or the sensation of sound by hair cells. These dynamic states originate from spontaneous oscillations of molecular motors. A particularly clear example of such oscillations has been observed in muscle fibers under non-physiological conditions. In that case, motor oscillations lead to contraction waves along the fiber. By a macroscopic analysis of muscle fiber dynamics we find that the spontaneous waves involve non-hydrodynamic modes. A simple microscopic model of sarcomere dynamics highlights mechanical aspects of the motor dynamics and fits with the experimental observations.

D1-81	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the role of DNA cannot be understated. This double-helix molecule, coiled within the nucleus of every cell, serves as the blueprint of life. Each strand, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - forms a complex code that dictates an organism's traits. This genetic information is passed down from parent to offspring, shaping the diversity of life on Earth. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to variations in traits, driving evolution.

D1-82	Molecular motors are single macromolecules that generate forces at the piconewton range and nanometer scale. They convert chemical energy into mechanical work by moving along filamentous structures. In this paper, we study the velocity of two-head molecular motors in the framework of a mechanochemical network theory. The network model, a generalization of the recently work of Liepelt and Lipowsky (PRL 98, 258102 (2007)), is based on the discrete mechanochemical states of a molecular motor with multiple cycles. By generalizing the mathematical method developed by Fisher and Kolomeisky for single cycle motor (PNAS(2001) 98(14) P7748-7753), we are able to obtain an explicit formula for the velocity of a molecular motor.
D1-83	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis, a fundamental process, unfolds in a myriad of plant species. Chlorophyll, the green pigment housed within chloroplasts, is the key player. It absorbs sunlight, converting light energy into chemical energy, primarily glucose. This process also releases oxygen, a vital component for Earth's atmosphere, thereby ensuring the survival of aerobic organisms. Moreover, photosynthesis serves as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and mitigating the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. This intricate dance of life and light, a testament to nature's intricate design, sustains our planet's biodiversity and ecosystems.
D1-84	We discuss multiscale simulations of long biopolymer translocation through wide nanopores that can accommodate multiple polymer strands. The simulations provide clear evidence of folding quantization, namely, the translocation proceeds through multi-folded configurations characterized by a well-defined integer number of folds. As a consequence, the translocation time acquires a dependence on the average folding number, which results in a deviation from the single-exponent power-law characterizing single-file translocation through narrow pores. The mechanism of folding quantization allows polymers above a threshold length (approximately $1,000$ persistence lengths for double-stranded DNA) to exhibit cooperative behavior and as a result to translocate noticeably faster.
D1-85	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) emerges as a significant player. This continuous network of membranous sacs and tubes, situated within the cytoplasm, serves dual functions. The rough ER, studded with ribosomes, is a site for protein synthesis, where newly formed proteins receive their characteristic structures through the addition of sugars and lipids. Conversely, the smooth ER, devoid of ribosomes, is primarily involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium storage, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. This dynamic organelle indeed underscores the complexity and versatility of cellular life.
D1-86	Neural feedback-triads consisting of two feedback loops with a non-reciprocal lateral connection from one loop to the other are ubiquitous in the brain. We show analytically that the dynamics of this network topology are determined by two algebraic combinations of its five synaptic weights. Thus different weight settings can generate equivalent network dynamics. Exploration of network activity over the two-dimensional parameter space demonstrates the importance of the non-reciprocal lateral connection and reveals intricate behavior involving continuous transitions between qualitatively different activity states. In addition, we show that the response to periodic inputs is narrowly tuned around a center frequency determined by the two effective synaptic parameters.

These microscopic plants form the base of the food chain, photosynthesizing in the sunlit ocean surface. They are the primary producers, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into organic matter and oxygen. Zooplankton, tiny aquatic animals, feed on phytoplankton, serving as the first link in the food web. Larger marine life, such as fish and whales, prey on these zooplankton consumers, demonstrating the interconnectedness of life within the ocean. However, human activities, including pollution and overfishing, can disrupt this intricate food chain, threatening the health and biodiversity of marine ecosystems.
D1-88	We present a macroscopic theory of electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics based on the laws of motion that govern atomic and molecular motion. The theory is an application of Zwanzig-Mori projection operators. The result is a simple equation of motion that has the form of a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which requires knowledge only of macroscopic properties. The macroscopic properties can be extracted from experimental data by one of two possible variational principles. These variational principles are our principal contribution to the formalism. Potential applications are discussed, including applications to the theory of critical phenomena in the brain, Granger causality and Kalman filters.
D1-89	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential process in biological nitrogen cycling, is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria like Rhizobium and Frankia. These microorganisms form nodules on root systems of leguminous plants, converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a usable form for plants. This mutualistic relationship enhances soil fertility and promotes plant growth, contributing significantly to agricultural productivity. Moreover, these nitrogen-fixing bacteria also play a crucial role in restoring soil nutrients after crop harvest, aiding in sustainable farming practices. The efficiency of nitrogen fixation can be optimized through selective breeding of legume varieties and judicious use of inoculants, thereby reducing the dependence on synthetic fertilizers and minimizing environmental pollution.
D1-90	Protein amyloid fibrils are a form of linear protein aggregates that are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we study the dynamics of amyloid fibril elongation by performing Langevin dynamic simulations on a coarse-grained model of peptides. Our simulation results suggest that the elongation process is dominated by a series of local minimum due to frustration in monomer-fibril interactions. This rugged energy landscape picture indicates that the amount of recycling of monomers at the fibrils' ends before being fibrilized is substantially reduced in comparison to the conventional two-step elongation model. This picture, along with other predictions discussed, can be tested with current experimental techniques.
D1-91	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, the mitochondrion stands as a powerhouse, converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process known as cellular respiration. This organelle, with its double-membrane structure, houses proteins essential for energy production, a testament to its vital role in sustaining life. Notably, mitochondria have their own DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA, which encodes for essential mitochondrial proteins. This unique characteristic, coupled with the ability to replicate independently, hints at an intriguing evolutionary history, potentially involving symbiosis with our eukaryotic ancestors. The study of mitochondria continues to unravel the complexities of life, offering invaluable insights into the origin of eukaryotic cells and the pathways of energy metabolism.
D1-92	We study the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under the load of environmental factors. A universal effect in ensembles of similar systems under the load of similar factors is described: in crisis, typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, correlation increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) increases too. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial time series.   A general approach to the explanation of the effect through dynamics of individual adaptation of similar non-interactive individuals to a similar system of external factors is developed. Qualitatively, this approach follows Selye's idea about adaptation energy.
D1-93	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics offers a fascinating layer of complexity. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it involves modifications to the structure of chromatin, the complex of DNA, proteins, and other molecules that form the chromosome. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can switch genes on or off and are influenced by factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. This dynamic interplay between genes and the external world underscores the profound impact our surroundings can have on our genetic makeup, thus bridging the gap between nature and nurture.
D1-94	The promotion of cooperation on spatial lattices is an important issue in evolutionary game theory. This effect clearly depends on the update rule: it diminishes with stochastic imitative rules whereas it increases with unconditional imitation. To study the transition between both regimes, we propose a new evolutionary rule, which stochastically combines unconditional imitation with another imitative rule. We find that, surprinsingly, in many social dilemmas this rule yields higher cooperative levels than any of the two original ones. This nontrivial effect occurs because the basic rules induce a separation of timescales in the microscopic processes at cluster interfaces. The result is robust in the space of 2x2 symmetric games, on regular lattices and on scale-free networks.
D1-95	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA strands unfolds, shaping the very essence of life. Each strand, a double helix of nucleotides, carries the blueprint for an organism, a coded symphony of genetic information. From the tiniest bacteria to the towering redwood, the same fundamental language of A's, T's, C's, and G's weaves the intricate tapestry of life. Mutations, the occasional errors in this celestial script, can lead to remarkable adaptations, driving evolution and diversification across the tree of life. The study of genetics offers a profound understanding of the connections that bind all living beings, illuminating the complex and awe-inspiring journey of life on Earth.
D1-96	We study the effect of extrinsic noise in metabolic networks. We introduce external random fluctuations at the kinetic level, and show how these lead to a stochastic generalization of standard Metabolic Control Analysis. While Summation and Connectivity Theorems hold true in presence of extrinsic noise, control coefficients incorporate its effect through an explicit dependency on the noise intensity. New elasticities and response coefficients are also defined. Accordingly, the concept of control by noise is introduced as a way of tuning the systemic behaviour of metabolisms. We argue that this framework holds for intrinsic noise too, when time-scale separation is present in the system.

A key question concerns the identification of the potentially most harmful knockouts. The integration of combinatorial methods with sampling techniques to explore the space of viable flux states may provide crucial insights on this issue. We assess the replaceability of every metabolic conversion in the human red blood cell by enumerating the alternative paths from substrate to product, obtaining a complete map of the potential damage of single enzymopathies. Sampling the space of optimal flux states in the healthy and in the mutated cell reveals both correlations and complementarity between topologic and dynamical aspects.

D1-100	We study the effect of migration between coupled populations, or patches, on the stability properties of multistrain disease dynamics. The epidemic model used in this work displays a Hopf bifurcation to oscillations in a single well mixed population. It is shown numerically that migration between two non-identical patches stabilizes the endemic steady state, delaying the onset of large amplitude outbreaks and reducing the total number of infections. This result is motivated by analyzing generic Hopf bifurcations with different frequencies and with diffusive coupling between them. Stabilization of the steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics rather than on details of the disease model.

The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies of molecular complex formation.
D1-105	 In the realm of genetics, a captivating subject emerges: epigenetics. This discipline delves into the modifications that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily driven by environmental factors, play a crucial role in cellular function and development. For instance, diet, stress, and aging can trigger these changes, which in turn may influence traits such as susceptibility to certain diseases or behavioral patterns. Epigenetics thus bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering a compelling perspective on the intricate interplay between genes and the environment.
D1-106	Non-extensive statistical physics has allowed to generalize mathematical functions such as exponential and logarithms. The same framework is used to generalize sum and product so that the operations allow a more fluid way to work with mathematical expressions emerging from non-additive formulation of statistical physics. In this work we employ the generalization of the exponential, logarithm and product to obtain a formula for the survival fraction corresponding to the application of several radiation doses on a living tissue. Also we provide experimental recommendations to determine the universal characteristics of living tissues in interaction with radiation. These results have a potential application in radiobiology and radiation oncology.
D1-107	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon, where living organisms emit light, is a captivating spectacle. This light production occurs due to a chemical reaction within the organism, typically involving a luciferin, luciferase, and oxygen. One prominent example, the dinoflagellate, Dinophysis, can cause red tides, releasing a toxin harmful to marine life and humans. Conversely, another bioluminescent dinoflagellate, Pyrocystis, emits a brilliant blue light when disturbed, creating mesmerizing waves of light in the ocean. This natural light show serves various functions, such as attracting prey, deterring predators, or communication among species. The study of bioluminescence offers valuable insights into the complex chemistry and behavior of marine life, shedding light on the intricacies of life beneath the waves.
D1-108	The explanation is that in aortic tissue (both diseased and nondiseased) a BAK1 pseudogene is expressed. while in the matching blood samples the actual BAK1 gene is expressed. This explanation was reached after we realized that BAK1 has two edited copies in human genome. These copies are probably BAK1 pseudogenes. One copy belongs to chromosome 11 (NG_005599.3) and the other to chromosome 20 (NC_000850.5). The first copy has frameshifts which means that probably it does not express any functional protein. by other hand, the chromosome 20 copy has no frameshifts and what is more important contains all the reported polymorphisms.

This biochemical process, performed by green plants and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. In essence, it's a symphony of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. The carbon dioxide is absorbed, water is split by sunlight, and the resulting molecules are reassembled to create glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen, essential for aerobic organisms, allows the continuous circulation of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's resilience, underpins the web of life, providing the energy for virtually all living organisms, from the tiniest plankton to the mightiest elephant.

We describe approaches to make the step from the parts list to the wiring diagram by using phenotypes for network inference and integrating them with complementary data sources. The first part of the review describes methods to analyze one- or low-dimensional phenotypes like viability or reporter activity. the second part concentrates on high-dimensional phenotypes showing global changes in cell morphology, transcriptome or proteome.
D1-111	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating area of exploration is epigenetics. This field delves into changes in organisms caused by modifications in gene expression rather than alterations to the genetic code itself. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are influenced by factors like age, environment, and behavior. Epigenetic modifications can be inherited, thereby potentially explaining how experiences, diet, and lifestyle choices may affect not just our health but also the health of future generations. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment highlights the intricate complexity of life, emphasizing that our lives are not just a product of our DNA but a symphony of genetic and environmental factors.
D1-112	Parts of DNA sequences known as exons and introns play very different role in coding and storage of genetic information. Here we show that their conducting properties are also very different. Taking into account long-range correlations among four basic nucleotides that form double-stranded DNA sequence, we calculate electron localization length for exon and intron regions. Analyzing different DNA molecules, we obtain that the exons have narrow bands of extended states, unlike the introns where all the states are well localized. The band of extended states is due to a specific form of the binary correlation function of the sequence of basic DNA nucleotides.
D1-113	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds, a process essential for life. This process involves the duplication of the entire genome, ensuring each newly formed cell receives an identical set of genetic instructions. Enzymes, notably helicases and polymerases, orchestrate this dance, unwinding double-stranded DNA and synthesizing new strands using the original as a template. The precision of this process is astounding, with each nucleotide added in its correct sequence, maintaining the integrity of the genetic code. This dance of DNA replication, a testament to the intricate and complex beauty of life, underpins growth, repair, and continuity of all living organisms.
D1-114	The origin of photodamage of single cells confined in laser tweezers is determined by comparison of action spectra with these recorded for a photoinduced response of cell populations. Triplet-singlet transitions in dissolved oxygen provide a common cause of both phenomena. Such transitions are forbidden in isolated O2 molecules, but occur in solutions due to the formation of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational excitations in H2O. The photodamage is a consequence of a toxic action produced by the singlet oxygen 1O2 (1.DELTA.gO2.).
D1-115	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of Prokaryotes unfolds a fascinating world. These single-celled organisms, devoid of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, are found virtually everywhere: soil, water, hot springs, and even within our bodies. Bacteria, Archaea, and Mollicutes, the three primary domains of Prokaryotes, exhibit remarkable diversity, adapting to a broad spectrum of environments. Their metabolic versatility is astounding, capable of breaking down complex chemicals and converting sunlight into energy, a process known as photosynthesis-like activity. Prokaryotes play crucial roles in ecosystems, from decomposing organic matter to forming symbiotic relationships with plants and animals. They are not just tiny organisms. they are vital players in the intricate dance of life on Earth.
D1-116	A new type of resonant light absorption by a small particle (nanocluster) is reported. The problem cannot be described within the commonly used dipole scattering approximation and should be studied with methods based upon the exact Mie solution. It is shown that the absorption cross-section has giant maxima realized at small values of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity of the particle. The maxima are situated in the vicinity of the plasmon (polariton) resonances and correspond to the regions where the dissipative damping equals the radiative one. The case is similar to the recently introduced anomalous scattering [PRL vol. 97, 263902 (2006)] and exhibits similar peculiarities.
D1-117	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. Consider the relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, microscopic algae residing within coral tissues. This symbiosis is crucial for the coral's survival, providing it with essential nutrients produced during photosynthesis. In return, the coral provides the algae with carbon dioxide, light, and a protective home. This mutualistic relationship is a testament to the enchanting complexity and interdependence that characterizes the natural world. Yet, this delicate balance is under threat due to climate change and ocean acidification, posing a grave risk to the health and survival of these vibrant underwater ecosystems.
D1-118	In this work, we study the adhesion of multi-component vesicle membrane to both flat and curved substrates, based on the conventional Helfrich bending energy for multi-component vesicles and adhesion potentials of different forms. A phase field formulation is used to describe the different components of the vesicle. For the axisymmetric case, a number of representative equilibrium vesicle shapes are computed and some energy diagrams are presented which reveal the dependence of the calculated shapes and solution branches on various parameters including both bending moduli and spontaneous curvatures as well as the adhesion potential constants. Our computation also confirms a recent experimental observation that the adhesion effect may promote phase separation in two-component vesicle membranes.
D1-119	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a testament to nature's precision and efficiency. This process, crucial for cell division and genetic continuity, unfolds in a precise and repeated manner. As the double helix unwinds, each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. Nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, are added in a stepwise manner by enzymes, forming a new helical structure identical to one of the original strands. This miraculous process ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning the diversity and resilience of life on Earth.
D1-120	We analyze the effects of noise correlations in the input to, or among, BCM neurons using the Wigner semicircular law to construct random, positive-definite symmetric correlation matrices and compute their eigenvalue distributions. In the finite dimensional case, we compare our analytic results with numerical simulations and show the effects of correlations on the lifetimes of synaptic strengths in various visual environments. These correlations can be due either to correlations in the noise from the input LGN neurons, or correlations in the variability of lateral connections in a network of neurons. In particular, we find that for fixed dimensionality, a large noise variance can give rise to long lifetimes of synaptic strengths. This may be of physiological significance.
D1-121	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating offshoot. Unlike DNA sequence alterations, epigenetic modifications subtly control gene expression without changing the actual genetic code. These modifications, chiefly methylation and histone modification, serve as molecular switches, influencing cellular behavior and playing a crucial role in biological processes ranging from development to disease susceptibility. Epigenetic changes can occur due to environmental factors, diet, stress, and aging, offering an exciting avenue for exploring how our lifestyle and surroundings might impact our DNA and potentially our health.
D1-122	The collective dynamics of coupled two-dimensional chaotic maps on complex networks is known to exhibit a rich variety of emergent properties which crucially depend on the underlying network topology. We investigate the collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli. Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime.
D1-123	 In the intricate world of genetics, a gene named BRCA1 has emerged as a significant player. This tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17, is crucial in maintaining cellular health. Mutations in BRCA1 can drastically increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers, particularly in women. However, it's essential to note that having a BRCA1 mutation does not inevitably lead to cancer. Lifestyle, environmental factors, and other genetic elements can also contribute to cancer development. Understanding BRCA1 and its role in hereditary cancer risk is vital for early detection, prevention strategies, and personalized treatment plans.
D1-124	We apply the approach of the Google matrix, used in computer science and World Wide Web, to description of properties of neuronal networks. The Google matrix ${\bf G}$ is constructed on the basis of neuronal network of a brain model discussed in PNAS {\bf 105}, 3593 (2008). We show that the spectrum of eigenvalues of ${\bf G}$ has a gapless structure with long living relaxation modes. The PageRank of the network becomes delocalized for certain values of the Google damping factor $\alpha$. The properties of other eigenstates are also analyzed. We discuss further parallels and similarities between the World Wide Web and neuronal networks.
D1-125	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of alleles plays a pivotal role. Alleles are variations of a particular gene, existing in alternative forms within a population. These variations can lead to differences in traits, such as eye color or blood type, among individuals. For instance, a gene controlling eye color might have alleles for brown, blue, and green eyes. An individual inherits two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. If both alleles are for brown eyes, the individual will have brown eyes. However, if one allele is for brown eyes and the other for blue eyes, the individual may exhibit heterozygous traits, like having eyes that lean towards one color or a combination of both. This genetic diversity, driven by allelic variations, is crucial for the survival and evolution of species.
D1-126	The Lee Carter modelling framework is widely used because of its simplicity and robustness despite its inability to model specific cohort effects. A large number of extensions have been proposed that model cohort effects but there is no consensus. It is difficult to simultaneously account for cohort effects and age-adjusted improvements and we here test a simple model that accounts for both: we simply add a non age-adjusted cohort component to the Lee Carter framework. This is a trade-off between accuracy and robustness but, for various countries present in the Human Mortality Database and compared to various models, the model accurately fits past mortality data and gives good backtesting projections.
D1-127	 In the realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, serves as a microscopic yet profound marker of genetic variation. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often occurring at specific locations within genes, can influence a myriad of biological traits, including susceptibility to diseases, drug response, and even physical characteristics. SNPs, when studied collectively, offer valuable insights into the intricate tapestry of human genetics, providing crucial tools for disease diagnosis, drug development, and personalized medicine. These minute variations, though seemingly insignificant, paint a grand picture of our unique genetic makeup and our shared evolutionary heritage.
D1-128	Certain migratory birds can sense the earth's magnetic field. The nature of this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be present in many species.
D1-129	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating offshoot. Epigenetics, a study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, offers profound insights into the complexities of biological systems. It provides an explanation for phenomena like imprinting, X-inactivation, and cellular memory, where similar DNA sequences result in diverse cellular functions. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, serve as a bridge between nature and nurture, suggesting that environmental factors can impact gene expression and potentially influence traits and diseases throughout an organism's lifespan. This dynamic field is reshaping our understanding of heredity, development, and disease mechanisms, offering promising avenues for future therapeutic interventions.
D1-130	The geometrical coupling between strain and twist in double helices is investigated. Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39.4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests the existence of zero-twist structures, i.e. structures that display neither overwinding, nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the overwinding of DNA, chromatin, and RNA are given.
D1-131	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a beacon of balance. This biochemical process, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy through the synthesis of glucose and other organic compounds. Through photosynthesis, these organisms convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen, a process essential for the survival of aerobic life forms on Earth. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesizers and aerobic life forms creates a harmonious ecosystem, where every breath we take is a testament to the power of photosynthesis.
D1-132	Metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm and harmony search are now becoming powerful methods for solving many tough optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new metaheuristic method, the Bat Algorithm, based on the echolocation behaviour of bats. We also intend to combine the advantages of existing algorithms into the new bat algorithm. After a detailed formulation and explanation of its implementation, we will then compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms, including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm seems much superior to other algorithms, and further studies are also discussed.
D1-133	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis often emerges as a compelling spectacle. This mutually beneficial relationship between species, such as the one between corals and zooxanthellae, has profound implications for our understanding of ecosystems. Zooxanthellae, single-celled algae, reside within coral tissues, providing the host with essential nutrients like carbon and nitrogen, while receiving shelter and inorganic nutrients in return. This harmonious coexistence not only aids in the growth and development of coral reefs but also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as a vital carbon sink. However, these delicate symbiotic relationships are vulnerable to environmental changes, such as rising ocean temperatures, which can lead to coral bleaching events, threatening the survival of these vital ecosystems.
D1-134	Starting from the hypothesis that the tubulin dimer is a conformationally bistable molecule - fluctuating between a curved and a straight configuration at room temperature - we develop a model for polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice. We show that tubulin bistability consistently explains unusual dynamic fluctuations, the apparent length-stiffness relation of grafted microtubules and the curved-helical appearance of microtubules in general. Analyzing experimental data we conclude that taxol stabilized microtubules exist in highly cooperative yet strongly fluctuating helical states. When clamped by the end the microtubule undergoes an unusual zero energy motion - in its effect reminiscent of a limited rotational hinge.
D1-135	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold considerable importance. These minute differences in DNA sequence among individuals within a species can influence various traits, from eye color to susceptibility to diseases. SNPs, located at specific positions along chromosomes, serve as genetic markers, aiding in genetic mapping and the study of hereditary patterns. The Human Genome Project, a monumental endeavor, has identified millions of SNPs in the human genome, providing valuable insights into the complexities of human inheritance and paving the way for personalized medicine and improved understanding of genetic disorders.
D1-136	The paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the peristaltic transport of a physiological fluid in a porous asymmetric channel under the action of a magnetic field. The stream function, pressure gradient and axial velocity are studied by using appropriate analytical and numerical techniques. Effects of different physical parameters such as permeability, phase difference, wave amplitude and magnetic parameter on the velocity, pumping characteristics, streamline pattern and trapping are investigated with particular emphasis. The computational results are presented in graphical form. The results are found to be in perfect agreement with those of a previous study carried out for a non-porous channel in the absence of a magnetic field.
D1-137	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a captivating frontier. Epigenetics, unlike traditional genetics, does not alter the DNA sequence itself but rather the expression of genes through modifications like methylation and histone tail alterations. These changes can influence an organism's development, behavior, and susceptibility to diseases, often in response to environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in the development of characteristics across generations through a process known as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. This fascinating field is shedding light on the complex interplay between genes and the environment, offering new avenues for disease prevention and treatment strategies.
D1-138	RNA-RNA binding is an important phenomenon observed for many classes of non-coding RNAs and plays a crucial role in a number of regulatory processes. Recently several MFE folding algorithms for predicting the joint structure of two interacting RNA molecules have been proposed. Here joint structure means that in a diagram representation the intramolecular bonds of each partner are pseudoknot-free, that the intermolecular binding pairs are noncrossing, and that there is no so-called ``zig-zag'' configuration. This paper presents the combinatorics of RNA interaction structures including their generating function, singularity analysis as well as explicit recurrence relations. In particular, our results imply simple asymptotic formulas for the number of joint structures.
D1-139	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent deep-sea anglerfish captivates scientists and explorers alike. This extraordinary creature, adapted to the darkest depths, emits a spectral glow through a light organ, luring unsuspecting prey towards its mouth. The light organ is a symbiotic relationship between the fish and a bacteria, known as Photobacterium, which generates the light through a chemical reaction called bioluminescence. The anglerfish's unique physiology, with its elongated head and barbed lure, epitomizes the wonders of evolution, showcasing how organisms can thrive even in the most inhospitable environments.
D1-140	The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression can lead to large variability of protein levels across a population of cells. Variability (or noise) in protein distributions can be modulated by cellular mechanisms of gene regulation. in particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the role of post-transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we propose and analyze a stochastic model for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The analytical solution of the model provides insight into the effects of different mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation on the noise in protein distributions. The results obtained also demonstrate how different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression can be discriminated based on observations of regulated protein distributions.
D1-141	 In the realm of cellular biology, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stands as a dynamic network, a labyrinth of membrane-bound organelles within eukaryotic cells. The ER is partitioned into two distinct regions: the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER, studded with ribosomes, is primarily responsible for protein synthesis, with the assistance of messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). In contrast, the SER, devoid of ribosomes, serves as a site for lipid synthesis, drug detoxification, and calcium storage. These intricate systems collaborate to sustain cellular homeostasis, ensuring the efficient production and modification of proteins, while also facilitating crucial metabolic processes.
D1-142	Genetic oscillators are a major theme of interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Until recently, most work has been carried out using intra-cellular oscillators, but this approach restricts the broader applicability of such systems. Motivated by a desire to develop large-scale, spatially-distributed cell-based computational systems, we present an initial design for a population-level oscillator which uses three different bacterial strains. Our system is based on the client-server model familiar to computer science, and uses quorum sensing for communication between nodes. We present the results of extensive in silico simulation tests, which confirm that our design is both feasible and robust.
D1-143	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen in green plants. This intricate biochemical reaction, occurring primarily in chloroplasts, is integral to life on Earth, as it provides energy for plant growth and generates the oxygen that sustains most living organisms. Notably, photosynthesis is also responsible for sequestering carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, helping to mitigate climate change. This life-giving, carbon-reducing process underscores the profound interconnectedness between plants, animals, and our planet's environment.
D1-144	One of the major functions of RecA protein in the cell is to bind single-stranded DNA exposed upon damage, thereby triggering the SOS repair response.We present fluorescence anisotropy measurements at the binding onset, showing enhanced DNA length discrimination induced by adenosine triphosphate consumption. Our model explains the observed DNA length sensing as an outcome of out-of equilibrium binding fluctuations, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. The cascade architecture of the binding fluctuations is a generalization of the kinetic proofreading mechanism. Enhancement of precision by an irreversible multistage pathway is a possible design principle in the noisy biological environment.
D1-145	 In the realm of evolutionary biology, the concept of natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, serves as a cornerstone. This theory suggests that populations evolve over generations due to differential survival and reproduction of individuals. Favorable traits that promote survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed down to offspring, gradually altering the population's genetic composition. This process, coupled with genetic mutation, drives the diversity and complexity of life on Earth, shaping the intricate web of species we observe today. Natural selection, though seemingly harsh, is a fundamental force that fosters adaptation and resilience in the face of environmental change.
D1-146	In this paper, we examine the effects of correlated Gaussian noise on a two-dimensional neuronal network that is locally modeled by the Rulkov map. More precisely, we study the effects of the noise correlation on the variations of the mean firing rate and the correlations among neurons versus the noise intensity. Via numerical simulations, we show that the mean firing rate can always be optimized at an intermediate noise intensity, irrespective of the noise correlation. On the other hand, variations of the population coherence with respect to the noise intensity are strongly influenced by the ratio between local and global Gaussian noisy inputs. Biological implications of our findings are also discussed.
D1-147	 In the realm of molecular biology, the study of DNA replication is paramount. This process, essential for life, involves the creation of an identical copy of a DNA molecule. The replication fork, a structure formed as the DNA unwinds, serves as the centerpoint. Enzymes like helicase and topoisomerase manage the unwinding and untangling of the double helix. Meanwhile, another enzyme, DNA polymerase, adds nucleotides in a precise sequence to build the new strand. This continuous process ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning the very essence of heredity.
D1-148	We study the thermal and mechanical behavior of DNA denaturation in the frame of the mesoscopic Peyrard- Bishop-Dauxois model with the inclusion of solvent interaction. By analyzing the melting transition of a homogeneous A-T sequence, we are able to set suitable values of the parameters of the model and study the formation and stability of bubbles in the system. Then, we focus on the case of the P5 promoter sequence and use the Principal Component Analysis of the trajectories to extract the main information on the dynamical behavior of the system. We find that this analysis method gives an excellent agreement with previous biological results.
D1-149	 In the intricate world of genetics, a gene named BRCA1 plays a pivotal role. This gene, short for Breast Cancer 1, is integral to DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints. Mutations in BRCA1 significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, primarily in women but also in men. These mutations can be hereditary, passed down through generations, or sporadic, occurring without a family history. Early detection, genetic counseling, and preventive measures can greatly reduce risks associated with BRCA1 mutations, providing hope and a path to proactive healthcare for many individuals.
D1-150	"Radical-ion-pair reactions were recently shown to represent a rich biophysical laboratory for the application of quantum measurement theory methods and concepts. We here show that radical-ion-pair reactions essentially form a non-linear biochemical double slit interferometer. Quantum coherence effects are visible when ""which-path"" information is limited, and the incoherent limit is approached when measurement-induced decoherence sets in. Based on this analogy with the optical double slit experiment we derive and elaborate on the fundamental master equation of spin-selective radical-ion-pair reactions that covers the continuous range from complete incoherence to maximum singlet-triplet coherence."
D1-151	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics offers intriguing insights. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, influence how genes are read and translated. This field has brought to light the complex interplay between our genes, environment, and behaviors, suggesting that conditions like cancer, aging, and even behavioral traits might be influenced by factors beyond our DNA. Epigenetics, therefore, opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating these complex conditions, moving us closer to a holistic understanding of biology.
D1-152	Self-organization of proteins in space and time is of crucial importance for the functioning of cellular processes. Often, this organization takes place in the presence of strong random fluctuations due to the small number of molecules involved. We report on stochastic switching of the Min-protein distributions between the two cell halves in short Escherichia coli cells. A computational model provides strong evidence that the macroscopic switching is rooted in microscopic noise on the molecular scale. In longer bacteria, the switching turns into regular oscillations that are required for positioning of the division plane. As the pattern becomes more regular, cell-to-cell variability also lessens, indicating cell length-dependent regulation of Min-protein activity.
D1-153	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid stands out as a fascinating creature. These enigmatic cephalopods, inhabiting the deep, dark ocean, possess the unique ability to produce light. This phenomenon is attributed to a chemical reaction within a specialized organ called the photophore. The light emitted serves various purposes, such as communication, camouflage, and even luring prey. The squid's intricate dance of light, a spectacle unseen by human eyes in its natural habitat, offers a glimpse into the mesmerizing world of bio-luminescence beneath the waves.
D1-154	From genetic regulatory networks to nervous systems, the interactions between elements in biological networks often take a sigmoidal or S-shaped form. This paper develops a probabilistic characterization of the parameter space of continuous-time sigmoidal networks (CTSNs), a simple but dynamically-universal model of such interactions. We describe an efficient and accurate method for calculating the probability of observing effectively M-dimensional dynamics in an N-element CTSN, as well as a closed-form but approximate method. We then study the dependence of this probability on N, M, and the parameter ranges over which sampling occurs. This analysis provides insight into the overall structure of CTSN parameter space.
D1-155	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a crucial extension. Epigenetics, quite simply, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence gene activity, ultimately shaping an organism's traits and behavior. Remarkably, epigenetic changes can occur due to external factors like diet, stress, and environmental toxins, suggesting a complex interplay between genes and the environment. This field offers promising avenues for understanding and potentially treating diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and even mental health disorders. The study of epigenetics continues to unveil the intricate dance between nature and nurture in shaping life.
D1-156	The activity of collections of synchronizing neurons can be represented by weakly coupled nonlinear phase oscillators satisfying Kuramoto's equations. In this article, we build such neural-oscillator models, partly based on neurophysiological evidence, to represent approximately the learning behavior predicted and confirmed in three experiments by well-known stochastic learning models of behavioral stimulus-response theory. We use three Kuramoto oscillators to model a continuum of responses, and we provide detailed numerical simulations and analysis of the three-oscillator Kuramoto problem, including an analysis of the stability points for different coupling conditions. We show that the oscillator simulation data are well-matched to the behavioral data of the three experiments.
D1-157	 In the intricate web of life, symbiotic relationships often play a pivotal role. Take, for instance, the mutualistic alliance between coral polyps and zooxanthellae algae. These tiny, photosynthetic organisms reside within the coral tissue, supplying essential nutrients to the host in exchange for shelter and sunlight. This partnership not only supports the coral's growth but also contributes to the vibrant colors we see in reef ecosystems. However, when environmental changes disrupt this harmony, as in instances of ocean acidification or warmer temperatures, the delicate balance can be disrupted, ultimately leading to coral bleaching and, in severe cases, the death of these vital organisms. Thus, understanding and preserving these symbiotic relationships are crucial for the health of our oceanic ecosystems.
D1-158	We show that autocatalytic networks of epsilon-machines and their population dynamics differ substantially between spatial (geographically distributed) and nonspatial (panmixia) populations. Generally, regions of spacetime-invariant autocatalytic networks---or domains---emerge in geographically distributed populations. These are separated by functional membranes of complementary epsilon-machines that actively translate between the domains and are responsible for their growth and stability. We analyze both spatial and nonspatial populations, determining the algebraic properties of the autocatalytic networks that allow for space to affect the dynamics and so generate autocatalytic domains and membranes. In addition, we analyze populations of intermediate spatial architecture, delineating the thresholds at which spatial memory (information storage) begins to determine the character of the emergent auto-catalytic organization.
D1-159	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential biological process, converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), a usable form of nitrogen for plants. This transformation is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Azospirillum, living in root nodules of legumes or associated with grasses. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria possess a unique enzyme, nitrogenase, which catalyzes the energy-intensive reaction. Nitrogen fixation plays a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle, replenishing soil fertility, and is crucial for global agricultural productivity. Moreover, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, aiding in environmental conservation efforts.
D1-160	We map the ultrasonic (8 MHz) speed and attenuation of edible-grade gelatin in water, exploring the key dependencies on temperature, concentration and time. The ultrasonic signatures of the sol-gel transition, confirmed by rheological measurements, and incomplete gel formation at low concentrations, enable a phase diagram of the system to be constructed. Sensitivity is also demonstrated to the kinetics of gel formation and melting, and associated hysteresis effects upon cyclic temperature sweeps. Furthermore, simple acoustic models of the sol and gel state enable estimation of the speed of sound and compressibility of gelatin. Our results demonstrate the potential of ultrasonic measurements to characterise the structure and visco-elasticity of gelatin hydrogels.
D1-161	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can subtly alter an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring frequently across the genome, serve as the foundation for genetic diversity. SNPs can influence a myriad of biological functions, from metabolism and disease susceptibility to behavior and physical features. For instance, a specific SNP in the human genome causes sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells' shape and function. On a larger scale, studying SNPs can provide insights into evolutionary history, as these variations accumulate over generations, revealing patterns of migration and adaptation. Thus, SNPs, these seemingly inconsequential changes in our DNA, play a pivotal role in understanding both individual differences and the larger tapestry of life.
D1-162	We systematize and extend the description of vesicle growth and shape change using linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. By restricting the study to shape changes from spheres to axisymmetric ellipsoids, we are able to give a consistent formulation which includes the lateral tension of the vesicle membrane. This allows us to generalize and correct a previous calculation. Our present calculations suggest that, for small growing vesicles, a prolate ellipsoidal shape should be favored over oblate ellipsoids, whereas for large growing vesicles oblates should be favored over prolates. The validity of this prediction is examined in the light of the various assumptions made in its derivation.
D1-163	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Essentially, it's a symphony of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, creating carbohydrates, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is vital for the survival of aerobic organisms, making photosynthesis an essential life-sustaining mechanism on our planet. It's a testament to nature's brilliance, a reminder of the delicate balance that underpins all life on Earth.
D1-164	The dominant reaction pathway (DRP) is a rigorous framework to microscopically compute the most probable trajectories, in non-equilibrium transitions. In the low-temperature regime, such dominant pathways encode the information about the reaction mechanism and can be used to estimate non-equilibrium averages of arbitrary observables. On the other hand, at sufficiently high temperatures, the stochastic fluctuations around the dominant paths become important and have to be taken into account. In this work, we develop a technique to systematically include the effects of such stochastic fluctuations, to order k_B T. This method is used to compute the probability for a transition to take place through a specific reaction channel and to evaluate the reaction rate.
D1-165	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can subtly alter protein function, impacting an organism's traits and susceptibility to diseases. These genetic variations, scattered across DNA, serve as the foundation for human diversity yet also contribute to complex health issues. For instance, a SNP in the APOE gene is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while another in the BRCA1 gene elevates breast cancer susceptibility. Understanding these SNPs, their interactions, and their downstream effects could potentially open new avenues for personalized medicine and disease prevention strategies.
D1-166	Modular organization characterizes many complex networks occurring in nature, including the brain. In this paper we show that modular structure may be responsible for increasing the robustness of certain dynamical states of such systems. In a neural network model with threshold-activated binary elements, we observe that the basins of attractors, corresponding to patterns that have been embedded using a learning rule, occupy maximum volume in phase space at an optimal modularity. Simultaneously, the convergence time to these attractors decreases as a result of cooperative dynamics between the modules. The role of modularity in increasing global stability of certain desirable attractors of a system may provide a clue to its evolution and ubiquity in natural systems.
D1-167	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics is a fascinating development. Unlike traditional gene sequencing, epigenetics delves into the chemical changes that influence gene expression, yet do not alter the DNA sequence itself. These changes can be caused by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle. For instance, stress can trigger methylation, a process that silences genes, potentially leading to health issues. Conversely, a healthy diet can promote demethylation, activating beneficial genes. Epigenetics thus offers a profound insight into how our behaviors and surroundings shape our biology, transcending the once static view of our genetic destiny.
D1-168	Understanding the physics of blood is challenging due to its nature as a suspension of soft particles and the fact that typical problems involve different scales. This is valid also for numerical investigations. In fact, many computational studies either neglect the existence of discrete cells or resolve relatively few cells very accurately. The authors recently developed a simple and highly efficient yet still particulate model with the aim to bridge the gap between currently applied methods. The present work focuses on its applicability to confined flows in vessels of diameters up to 100 micrometres. For hematocrit values below 30 percent, a dependence of the apparent viscosity on the vessel diameter in agreement with experimental literature data is found.

The satisfactory agreement between theory and available experiments validates the physical plausibility of the model developed here. In particular, we predict a rather abrupt increase of the variance of current fluctuations in concomitance with that of the I-V characteristic. The sharp increase, for about five orders of magnitude of current variance is associated with the opening of low resistance paths responsible for the sharp increase of the I-V characteristics. A strong non-Gaussian behavior of the associated probability distribution function is further detected by numerical calculations.

The basic function of Kinesin-5 is to slide apart two anti-parallel microtubules by simultaneously walking on both the microtubules. We develop an analytical expression for the steady-state relative velocity of this sliding in terms of the rates of attachments and detachments of motor heads with the ATPase sites on the microtubules. We first analyse the motion of one pair of motor heads on one microtubule and then couple it to the motion of the other pair of motor heads of the same motor on the second microtubule to get the relative velocity of sliding.

To determine the synaptic strength of existent connections and store the phase-coded patterns, we introduce a learning rule inspired to the spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that, after learning, the spontaneous dynamics of the network replay one of the stored dynamical patterns, depending on the network initialization.

We show conditions under which simpler models may be substituted for more detailed models, and in so doing we define a hierarchy of epidemic models. In particular we provide conditions under which it is appropriate to use the standard mass action SIR model, and we show what happens when these conditions fail. Using our hierarchy, we provide a procedure leading to the choice of the appropriate model for a given population. Our result about the convergence of models to the Mass Action model gives clear, rigorous conditions under which the Mass Action model is accurate.

These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can switch genes on and off, ultimately determining an organism's traits and even predisposing it to certain diseases. This field sheds light on how our lifestyle, diet, and life experiences can influence our genetic expression, offering hope for preventive healthcare strategies and potential treatment possibilities for a variety of conditions.
D1-226	"In complex systems, the interplay between nonlinear and stochastic dynamics, e.g., J. Monod's necessity and chance, gives rise to an evolutionary process in Darwinian sense, in terms of discrete jumps among attractors, with punctuated equilibrium, spontaneous random ""mutations"" and ""adaptations"". On an evlutionary time scale it produces sustainable diversity among individuals in a homogeneous population rather than convergence as usually predicted by a deterministic dynamics. The emergent discrete states in such a system, i.e., attractors, have natural robustness against both internal and external perturbations. Phenotypic states of a biological cell, a mesoscopic nonlinear stochastic open biochemical system, could be understood through such a perspective."
D1-227	 In the vast realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound effects. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring between individuals in a species, can influence traits, susceptibility to diseases, and even responses to medications. For instance, a SNP in the BRCA1 gene is linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Similarly, a SNP in the CYP2D6 gene determines the metabolic efficiency of specific drugs, impacting their effectiveness and potential side effects. The study of SNPs, therefore, provides invaluable insights into the intricate dance of genes, health, and human diversity.
D1-228	In this paper we develop mathematical models for collective cell motility. Initially we develop a model using a linear diffusion-advection type equation and fit the parameters to data from cell motility assays. This approach is helpful in classifying the results of cell motility assay experiments. In particular, this model can determine degrees of directed versus undirected collective cell motility. Next we develop a model using a nonlinear diffusion term that is able capture in a unified way directed and undirected collective cell motility. Finally we apply the nonlinear diffusion approach to a problem in tumor cell invasion, noting that neither chemotaxis or haptotaxis are present in the system under consideration in this article.
D1-229	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a captivating spectacle. This natural light emission, produced by certain organisms, offers a mesmerizing underwater display. Bioluminescent creatures, like the anglerfish and the deep-sea squid, use this light for various purposes such as attracting prey, communicating, or camouflaging. The light source is a chemical reaction within the organism, where a luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase react in the presence of oxygen and ATP, emitting blue or green light. This process is efficient yet energy-intensive, as it occurs in the oxygen minimum zones of the deep sea, where the available light is scarce. This intriguing biological phenomenon adds a magical touch to the mysteries of the deep sea.
D1-230	We study time averages of single particle trajectories in scale free anomalous diffusion processes, in which the measurement starts at some time t_a>0 after initiation of the process at the time origin, t=0. Using ageing renewal theory we show that for such non-stationary processes a large class of observables are affected by a unique ageing function, which is independent of boundary conditions or the external forces. We quantify the weakly non-ergodic nature of this process in terms of the distribution of time averages and the ergodicity breaking parameter which both explicitly depend on the ageing time t_a. Consequences for the interpretation of single particle tracking data are discussed.
D1-231	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the gene serves as the basic unit of heredity. DNA, a double helix structure, encodes these genes. Each gene carries instructions for a specific protein, guiding the growth, function, and maintenance of an organism. Genes can be inherited from both parents, with some dominant or recessive traits determining physical and behavioral characteristics. Mutations, alterations in the gene sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, showcasing the crucial role genes play in shaping life. Understanding genes and their behaviors is essential in unraveling the mysteries of life, facilitating advancements in medicine and agriculture, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the complex tapestry of life on Earth.
D1-232	Biochemical reaction networks are subjected to large fluctuations attributable to small molecule numbers, yet underlie reliable biological functions. Most theoretical approaches describe them as purely deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems, depending on which point of view is favored. Here, we investigate the dynamics of a self-repressing gene using an intermediate approach based on a moment closure approximation of the master equation, which allows us to take into account the binary character of gene activity. We thereby obtain deterministic equations that describe how nonlinearity feeds back fluctuations into the mean-field equations, providing insight into the interplay of determinism and stochasticity. This allows us to identify regions of parameter space where fluctuations induce relatively regular oscillations.
D1-233	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a mesmerizing dance of enzymes and molecules. A double helix splits, each strand serving as a template for a new complementary strand. The enzyme helicase unwinds the helix, followed by the action of another enzyme, primase, which adds short RNA primers to the exposed single-stranded regions. Then, the DNA polymerase swoops in, adding nucleotides in a precise sequence, guided by the template strand. This continual duplication ensures the integrity and propagation of genetic information from one generation of cells to the next, a testament to life's intricate and resilient design.
D1-234	The network approach became a widely used tool to understand the behaviour of complex systems in the last decade. We start from a short description of structural rigidity theory. A detailed account on the combinatorial rigidity analysis of protein structures, as well as local flexibility measures of proteins and their applications in explaining allostery and thermostability is given. We also briefly discuss the network aspects of cytoskeletal tensegrity. Finally, we show the importance of the balance between functional flexibility and rigidity in protein-protein interaction, metabolic, gene regulatory and neuronal networks. Our summary raises the possibility that the concepts of flexibility and rigidity can be generalized to all networks.
D1-235	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a fascinating study. Epigenetics explores modifications in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it focuses on chemical tags added to DNA or histones, the proteins that package DNA, which alter how genes are read and expressed. These modifications can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, thereby impacting an organism's development, behavior, and susceptibility to illnesses. This dynamic interplay between genes and their environment offers intriguing insights into how traits are inherited, and how they might be influenced and possibly modified throughout an individual's life.
D1-236	How networks endure damage is a central issue in neural network research. This includes temporal as well as spatial pattern of damage. Here, based on some very simple models we study the difference between a slow-growing and acute damage and the relation between the size and rate of injury. Our result shows that in both a three-layer and a homeostasis model a slow-growing damage has a decreasing effect on network disability as compared with a fast growing one. This finding is in accord with clinical reports where the state of patients before and after the operation for slow-growing injuries is much better that those patients with acute injuries.
D1-237	 In marine biology, the majestic whale shark (Rhincodon typus) stands as the largest fish species, boasting a length of up to 60 feet. This gentle giant, characterized by its distinctive white spots and broad, flattened head, migrates across vast oceans to feed on plankton. Despite its colossal size, the whale shark is a filter feeder, sifting tiny organisms from the water using its immense gill rakers. A key indicator of ocean health, these aquatic titans provide valuable insights into the state of marine ecosystems, offering crucial data for conservation efforts. Their survival, however, is threatened by incidents of accidental entanglement in fishing gear and the demand for shark fins, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices and increased protection measures.
D1-238	The composition of narrow distribution poly ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymer (Mw ~ 8700 Da) was studied using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymer produced oligomers separated by 14 Da. The average resolving power over the entire spectrum was 28,000. Approximately 448 isotopically resolved peaks representing about 56 oligomers are identified. Although agreement between experimental and calculated isotopic distributions was strong, the compositional assignment was difficult. This is due to the large number of possible isobaric components. The purpose of this research is to resolve and study the composition of high mass copolymer such as ethylene oxide-propylene oxide.
D1-239	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) holds significant sway. This minute difference in a DNA sequence can lead to varying traits and diseases in organisms. SNPs serve as genetic markers, providing insights into ancestry and susceptibility to certain health conditions. For instance, a specific SNP might predispose an individual to diabetes, while another could influence eye color. The study of SNPs has revolutionized medical research, offering a pathway towards personalized medicine and a deeper understanding of our genetic heritage.
D1-240	Cross-linked actomyosin bundles retract when severed in vivo by laser ablation, or when isolated from the cell and micromanipulated in vitro in the presence of ATP. We identify the time scale for contraction as a viscoelastic time tau, where the viscosity is due to (internal) protein friction. We obtain an estimate of the order of magnitude of the contraction time tau ~ 10-100 s, consistent with available experimental data for circumferential microfilament bundles and stress fibers. Our results are supported by an exactly solvable, hydrodynamic model of a retracting bundle as a cylinder of isotropic, active matter, from which the order of magnitude of the active stress is estimated.
D1-241	 Embryonic stem cells, a fascinating realm in biology, hold immense potential for medical advancements. Derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, these cells are pluripotent, capable of giving rise to all cell types in the body. Their unique characteristic allows for their use in regenerative medicine, offering hope for the treatment of various diseases such as Parkinson's and diabetes. However, ethical concerns persist due to the sourcing of these cells from embryos. Research efforts are ongoing to identify alternative sources, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be generated from adult cells, potentially alleviating these moral dilemmas. The exploration of embryonic stem cells promises to revolutionize medicine, bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications.
D1-242	The expansion of tools against HIV transmission has brought increased interest in epidemiological models that can predict the impact of these interventions. The EMOD-HIV model was recently compared to eleven other independently developed mathematical models of HIV transmission to determine the extent to which they agree about the potential impact of expanded use of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. Here we describe in detail the modeling methodology used to produce the results in this comparison, which we term EMOD-HIV v0.7. We include a discussion of the structure and a full list of model parameters. We also discuss the architecture of the model, and its potential utility in comparing structural assumptions within a single modeling framework.
D1-243	 In marine ecosystems, the role of seaweed, or marine algae, is pivotal. They provide essential nutrients and oxygen, acting as the primary producers. By photosynthesis, they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic matter, serving as a food source for various marine organisms. Seaweed also plays a crucial part in the nitrogen cycle, absorbing excess nitrogen from the water, reducing eutrophication and promoting a balanced ecosystem. Moreover, these underwater forests contribute to coastal protection by buffering waves and reducing shoreline erosion. However, overexploitation and pollution pose significant threats to seaweed populations, jeopardizing the health of marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities that depend on them.
D1-244	One of the principal models of magnetic sensing in migratory birds rests on the quantum spin-dynamics of transient radical pairs created photochemically in ocular cryptochrome proteins. We consider here the role of electron spin entanglement and coherence in determining the sensitivity of a radical pair-based geomagnetic compass and the origins of the directional response. It emerges that the anisotropy of radical pairs formed from spin-polarized molecular triplets could form the basis of a more sensitive compass sensor than one founded on the conventional hyperfine-anisotropy model. This property offers new and more flexible opportunities for the design of biologically inspired magnetic compass sensors.
D1-245	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, bridging the realms of chemistry and biology. This process, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis unfolds in two phases: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, where photons are absorbed by chlorophyll, triggering a series of chemical reactions that generate ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules fuel the Calvin cycle, a sequence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert carbon dioxide into glucose, the fundamental sugar molecule essential for all life forms. Thus, photosynthesis not only provides plants with energy but also sustains the Earth's oxygen supply and forms the basis of our planet's food chain.
D1-246	Quantum noise places a fundamental limit on the per photon sensitivity attainable in optical measurements. This limit is of particular importance in biological measurements, where the optical power must be constrained to avoid damage to the specimen. By using non-classically correlated light, we demonstrated that the quantum limit can be surpassed in biological measurements. Quantum enhanced microrheology was performed within yeast cells by tracking naturally occurring lipid granules with sensitivity 2.4 dB beyond the quantum noise limit. The viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm could thereby be determined with a 64% improved measurement rate. This demonstration paves the way to apply quantum resources broadly in a biological context.
D1-247	 In the realm of marine biology, the octopus stands out as an intriguing and intelligent cephalopod. With a soft, camouflaging body and three hearts pumping blood, they are masters of disguise, adapting their color and texture to blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Octopuses possess a highly developed nervous system, allowing them to solve complex problems and even escape jars by unscrewing the lids. Their arms, each with its own brain, aid in this unique intelligence, enabling them to manipulate objects with precision. Despite their intelligence, octopuses have a short lifespan, typically living for only one to two years. The octopus, with its complex behaviors and remarkable abilities, continues to enthrall scientists and captivate our imagination.
D1-248	"Complex systems, in many different scientific sectors, show coarse-grain properties with simple growth laws with respect to fundamental microscopic algorithms. We propose a classification scheme of growth laws which includes human aging, tumor (and/or tissue) growth, logistic and generalized logistic growth and the aging of technical devices. The proposed classification permits to evaluate the aging/failure of combined new bio-technical ""manufactured products"", where part of the system evolves in time according to biological-mortality laws and part according to technical device behaviors. Moreover it suggests a direct relation between the mortality leveling-off for humans and technical devices and the observed small cure probability for large tumors."
D1-249	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a revolutionary tool. This innovative technology, derived from bacterial immunity, allows for precise and efficient editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing the power of guide RNAs, scientists can navigate the genome with unprecedented accuracy, correcting errors, inserting new genes, or even disabling harmful ones. This groundbreaking approach holds immense promise for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even combating invasive species, ushering in a new era of genetic modification. However, ethical considerations and potential unintended consequences demand careful scrutiny as we navigate the uncharted territories this technology opens up.
D1-250	We estimated the aerial biomass and stored carbon in twelve types of forests in the department of C\'ordoba with annual rain fall ranging from 3000 mm (super humid climates) to 1300 mm (semi-humid climate). Biomass was estimated based on structural aspects of the vegetation (diameter at breast height, total height, and wood specific weight). We tested nine allometric equations for tropical forests available in the literature and selected those proposed by Chave et al (2005) that are specific for humid and dry forests. Carbon content in trees was measured in four tissues (stem, branch, bark, and leafs) through an automated dry combustion method, which estimates the percentage of carbon in a sample of known weight.
D1-251	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant paradigm shift. It delves into the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can be inherited, thus bridging nature and nurture. One prime example is DNA methylation, a process where a methyl group is added to DNA, altering its structure and influencing gene activity. This intricate dance between genes and environment offers tantalizing insights into the complexities of heredity and development, promising a deeper understanding of diseases, aging, and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
D1-252	A mesoscopic model which allows us to identify and quantify the strength of binding sites in DNA sequences is proposed. The model is based on the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model for the DNA chain coupled to a Brownian particle which explores the sequence interacting more importantly with open base pairs of the DNA chain. We apply the model to promoter sequences of different organisms. The free energy landscape obtained for these promoters shows a complex structure that is strongly connected to their biological behavior. The analysis method used is able to quantify free energy differences of sites within genome sequences.
D1-253	 In the realm of genetic research, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has been instrumental in reshaping our understanding of DNA. This bacterial defense mechanism, repurposed as a gene-editing tool, allows precise modifications to targeted DNA sequences, opening avenues for potential cures to genetic diseases. By introducing custom-designed cuts into DNA, scientists can correct errors, suppress or delete harmful genes, or even enhance desirable traits. This technology, however, is not without ethical and safety concerns, necessitating thoughtful regulation and careful application to ensure its benefits outweigh potential risks. As research progresses, the implications of CRISPR-Cas9 extend beyond healthcare, promising a future where we can not only cure diseases but also influence the very fabric of life.
D1-254	Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.
D1-255	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert significant impact. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at specific genes, influence a wide array of biological traits. For instance, a SNP in the APOE gene is linked to susceptibility towards Alzheimer's disease, while another in the BRCA1 gene heightens the risk of breast cancer. Ultimately, understanding these genetic variations can pave the way for precision medicine, enabling targeted treatment strategies based on an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-256	In a single molecule assay, the motion of a molecular motor is often inferred from measuring the stochastic trajectory of a large probe particle attached to it. We discuss a simple model for this generic set-up taking into account explicitly the elastic coupling between probe and motor. The combined dynamics consists of discrete steps of the motor and continuous Brownian motion of the probe. Motivated by recent experiments on the F1-ATPase, we investigate three types of efficiencies both in simulations and a Gaussian approximation. Overall, we obtain good quantitative agreement with the experimental data. In particular, we clarify the conditions under which one of these efficiencies becomes larger than one.
D1-257	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis emerges as a pivotal process, binding the green realm with the atmosphere. This biochemical miracle, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy into chemical energy, primarily glucose. Through a series of reactions, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air and water from the soil, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and Earth's atmosphere regulates the oxygen levels and carbon dioxide concentration, maintaining the delicate balance essential for life's sustenance. Moreover, photosynthesis serves as the primary food source for most organisms on our planet, underpinning the complex food web, and contributing to the planet's overall energy flow.
D1-258	In this paper, by using a stochastic reaction-diffusion-taxis model, we analyze the picophytoplankton dynamics in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by poorly mixed waters. The model includes intraspecific competition of picophytoplankton for light and nutrients. The multiplicative noise sources present in the model account for random fluctuations of environmental variables. Phytoplankton distributions obtained from the model show a good agreement with experimental data sampled in two different sites of the Sicily Channel. The results could be extended to analyze data collected in different sites of the Mediterranean Sea and to devise predictive models for phytoplankton dynamics in oligotrophic waters.
D1-259	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a mesmerizing dance between enzymes and the double helix. This process, essential for cell division and growth, is a meticulous duplication of the genetic blueprint. The DNA strand unwinds, as helicase enzymes separate the two strands. Single-stranded binding proteins prevent the separation strands from re-bonding, ensuring accuracy. Replication forks, formed by the complex of enzymes, move along the template strands, synthesizing new complementary strands in a 5' to 3' direction. Proofreading enzymes correct errors during replication, maintaining the integrity of genetic information. This intricate dance of life, repeated countless times, underpins the continuity of life, passing on genes accurately from one generation to the next.
D1-260	Highly correlated brain dynamics produces synchronized states with no behavioral value, while weakly correlated dynamics prevent information flow. In between these states, the unique dynamical features of the critical state endow the brain with properties which are fundamental for adaptive behavior. We discuss the idea put forward two decades ago by Per Bak that the working brain stays at an intermediate (critical) regime characterized by power-law correlations. This proposal is now supported by a wide body of empirical evidence at different scales demonstrating that the spatiotemporal brain dynamics exhibit key signatures of critical dynamics, previously recognized in other complex systems. The rationale behind this program is discussed in these notes, followed by an account of the most recent results.
D1-261	 In botany, photosynthesis is a fundamental process that occurs in green plants, algae, and some bacteria. This intricate biochemical reaction harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose, a simple sugar, serves as the primary energy source for the organism, while oxygen supports aerobic respiration in other life forms. This symbiotic cycle, harmoniously integrating light, carbon, and water, sustains life on Earth by regenerating organic matter and maintaining our planet's oxygen levels.
D1-262	The evidence that Flowering Locus T (FT) protein and its paralog Twin Sister of FT, act as the long distance floral stimulus, or at least that they are part of it in diverse plant species, has attracted much attention in recent years. Studies to understand the physiological and molecular apparatuses that integrate spatial and temporal signals to regulate developmental transition in plants have occupied countless scientists and have resulted in an unmanageably large amount of research data. Analysis of these data has helped to identify multiple systemic florigenic and antiflorigenic regulators. This study gives an overview of the recent research on gene products, phytohormones and other metabolites that have been demonstrated to have florigenic or antiflorigenic functions in plants.
D1-263	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating phenomenon known as epigenetics is increasingly capturing scientific attention. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these modifications occur via chemical tags added to the DNA or histone proteins that package DNA within the cell nucleus. These tags can be altered by various environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and toxins, thereby influencing gene function and potentially leading to heritable traits. This dynamic interplay between genes and their environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and opens up new avenues for understanding and addressing health and developmental issues.
D1-264	Some mathematical models for the estimation of the effects of Cry1Ab and Cry1F Bt-maize exposure in the biodiversity are discussed. Novel results about these models are obtained and described in the note. The exact formula for the proportion of the population that suffers mortality exposed to Cry1Ab pollen, underlining its dependence on the margin from the Bt crop edge, is derived. In addition, regarding Cry1F pollen effects, it is proposed a procedure, using a probabilistic and statistical approach, that computes the width of the non Bt-stripes used as mitigation measures. Finally, it has been derived a lower bound, using probabilistic consideration, on the species sensitivity of Lepidoptera.
D1-265	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a striking phenomenon known as genetic drift unfolds. This random, non-directional change in allele frequencies within a population can significantly impact gene pool composition. It's akin to a roll of dice, where the fate of a gene might be decided by chance events such as migration, mutation, or even the survival of the fittest in small isolated groups. This process can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, causing unexpected traits to emerge or disappear, defying the laws of natural selection. Genetic drift, in essence, underscores the unpredictability that lurks beneath the surface of genetic evolution.
D1-266	The syncytial cells of a filamentous fungus consist of a mass of growing, tube-like hyphae. Each extending tip is fed by a continuous flow of nuclei from the colony interior, pushed by a gradient in turgor pressure. The myco-fluidic flows of nuclei are complex and multidirectional, like traffic in a city. We map out the flows in a strain of the model filamentous fungus {\it N. crassa} that has been transformed so that nuclei express either hH1-dsRed (a red fluorescent nuclear protein) or hH1-GFP (a green-fluorescent protein) and report our results in a fluid dynamics video.
D1-267	 In the realm of molecular biology, the humble RNA molecule plays a pivotal role. Not merely a passive byproduct of DNA, RNA serves as an active player in protein synthesis. It acts as a messenger, carrying genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes, where proteins are built. Furthermore, RNA also assumes regulatory roles, often influencing gene expression. Additionally, some RNA molecules, like ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA, are structural components in the protein-manufacturing machinery itself. Thus, RNA's versatility and multifaceted functions underscore its indispensable role in the intricate dance of life.
D1-268	Recent experiments on the green alga Chlamydomonas that swims using synchronized beating of a pair of flagella have revealed that it exhibits a run-and-tumble behavior similar to that of bacteria such as E. Coli. Using a simple purely hydrodynamic model that incorporates a stroke cycle and an intrinsic Gaussian white noise, we show that a stochastic run-and-tumble behavior could emerge, due to the nonlinearity of the combined synchronization-rotation-translation dynamics. This suggests the intriguing possibility that the alga might exploit nonlinear mechanics---as opposed to sophisticated biochemical circuitry as used by bacteria---to control its behavior.
D1-269	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, essentially, refers to modifications in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, are crucial in regulating gene activity and can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle. Epigenetic changes can be heritable, meaning they can be passed down from one generation to another, contributing to the study of hereditary diseases and the vast complexities of genetic inheritance. Moreover, epigenetics offers promising avenues in understanding and potentially treating certain diseases, such as cancer, where abnormal epigenetic patterns are often observed.
D1-270	Limited spectrum coverage is a problem in shotgun proteomics. Replicates are generated to improve the spectrum coverage. When integrating peptide identification results obtained from replicates, the state-of-the-art algorithm PeptideProphet combines Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) before building the statistical model to calculate peptide probabilities.   In this paper, we find the connection between merging results of replicates and Bagging, which is a standard routine to improve the power of statistical methods. Following Bagging's philosophy, we propose to run PeptideProphet separately on each replicate and combine the outputs to obtain the final peptide probabilities. In our experiments, we show that the proposed routine can improve PeptideProphet consistently on a standard protein dataset, a Human dataset and a Yeast dataset.
D1-271	 In the realm of botany, the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots is a fascinating example of nature's intricate interconnectivity. These fungi, invisible to the naked eye, form a network around the plant's roots, enhancing nutrient absorption and water uptake. In return, the plant provides the fungi with sugars produced during photosynthesis. This mutualistic partnership, though unseen, significantly contributes to the health and survival of many plant species, offering vital lessons on cooperation and interdependence in the natural world.
D1-272	Studies of coevolution of amino acids within and between proteins have revealed two types of coevolving units: coevolving contacts, which are pairs of amino acids distant along the sequence but in contact in the three-dimensional structure, and sectors, which are larger groups of structurally connected amino acids that underlie the biochemical properties of proteins. By reconciling two approaches for analyzing correlations in multiple sequence alignments, we link these two findings together and with coevolving units of intermediate size, called `sectons', which are shown to provide additional information. By extending the analysis to the co-occurrence of orthologous genes in bacterial genomes, we also show that the methods and results are general and relevant beyond protein structures.
D1-273	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged, shedding light on the complex interplay between genes and environment. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications can be influenced by factors like diet, stress, and age, offering insights into how external factors can impact biological traits and disease susceptibility. Epigenetics adds a layer of intricacy to our understanding of heredity, suggesting that our environment can leave lasting marks on our genetic expression, potentially shaping our health and wellbeing.
D1-274	Metacommunity theory is considered a promising approach for explaining species diversity and food web complexity. Recently Pillai et al. proposed a simple modeling framework for the dynamics of food webs at the metacommunity level. Here, we employ this framework to compute general conditions for the persistence of complex food webs in metacommunities. The persistence conditions found depend on the connectivity of the resource patches and the structure of the assembled food web, thus linking the underlying spatial patch-network and the species interaction network. We find that the persistence of omnivores is more likely when it is feeding on (a) prey on low trophic levels, and (b) prey on similar trophic levels.
D1-275	 In the realm of biology, the phenomenon of photosynthesis is a captivating dance of life. Green chloroplasts within plant cells, the solar panels of our world, harness sunlight's energy, converting it into chemical energy through a process that splits water molecules. Carbon dioxide, drawn from the atmosphere, is transformed into glucose, the primary energy source for plants, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This essential process sustains life on Earth, creating an intricate web of interdependence between flora and fauna, reinforcing the delicate balance of our ecosystem.
D1-276	The cable equation is a second order, parabolic, partial differential equation that describes the evolution of voltage in the dendrite of a neuron. Here we look at the various ways in which lambda(space constant/ variable space constant/length parameter) is calculated in the cases of linear, passive transmission as well as nonlinear active transmission. Changes in morphology are taken into account by including the case of tapering dendrite, branched dendrites, branched dendrites with taper or flare. The case of variable membrane resistance and the relationship between input resistance and space constant is explored. Finally the reaction diffusion equation governing the diffusion of calcium in dendrites and space constant associated with that is described.
D1-277	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency. This revolutionary tool, harnessed from bacteria's immune defense mechanism, allows scientists to snip, replace, or silence specific DNA sequences within an organism's genome. Its potential applications span vastly, from treating genetic diseases, to enhancing crop yield, and even combating invasive species. However, the ethical implications are complex, raising questions about the manipulation of human heredity and the potential for designer babies. As we navigate this exciting frontier, careful consideration must be given to the moral, social, and environmental consequences of our actions.
D1-278	Starting from fitness correlation functions, we calculate exact expressions for the amplitude spectra of fitness landscapes as defined by P.F. Stadler [J. Math. Chem. 20, 1 (1996)] for common landscape models, including Kauffman's NK-model, rough Mount Fuji landscapes and general linear superpositions of such landscapes. We further show that correlations decaying exponentially with the Hamming distance yield exponentially decaying spectra similar to those reported recently for a model of molecular signal transduction. Finally, we compare our results for the model systems to the spectra of various experimentally measured fitness landscapes. We claim that our analytical results should be helpful when trying to interpret empirical data and guide the search for improved fitness landscape models.
D1-279	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits and susceptibility to diseases. These tiny variations in DNA sequence, occurring as frequently as once every 300 bases, can subtly alter protein function, gene regulation, and even DNA structure. For instance, a SNP in the gene responsible for lactose intolerance might explain why some humans struggle to digest milk, while others do not. Similarly, SNPs in genes associated with Alzheimer's disease could potentially predispose individuals to this neurodegenerative disorder. Understanding these genetic variations not only deepens our knowledge of human biology but also opens doors for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-280	Nanoscale biosensors are devices designed to detect analytes by combining biological components and physicochemical detectors. One of the well known methods of constructing these sensors is by using nanocantilevers. These microscopic 'diving boards' are coated with binding probes that have an affinity to a particular amino acid, enzyme or protein in living organisms. When these probes attract some target particles, such as biomolecules, they change the vibrating frequency of the cantilever. This process is random in nature and produces fluctuations in the frequency and damping of the cantilever. In this paper, we studied the effect of these fluctuations using a stochastically perturbed classical harmonic oscillator.
D1-281	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or firefly squid, exhibits a captivating display of light. This deep-sea creature, found primarily in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, possesses a unique light-emitting organ, the photophores, which are strategically placed around its body. The squid can control the intensity and pattern of these lights, using them as camouflage, communication, or to lure prey. The light emitted is a result of a chemical reaction within the photophores, ultimately showcasing nature's brilliant spectacle in the darkest depths of the ocean.
D1-282	A formalism is developed which describes the extent to which stochastic oscillations in biochemical models are synchronised. It is based on the calculation of the complex coherence function within the linear noise approximation. The method is illustrated on a simple example and then applied to study the synchronisation of chemical concentrations in social amoeba. The degree to which variation of rate constants in different cells and the volume of the cells affects synchronisation of the oscillations is explored, and the phase lag calculated. In all cases the analytical results are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained through numerical simulations.
D1-283	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone, the green symphony orchestrating the survival of countless species. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria harness solar energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and releasing oxygen in this miraculous process. This oxygen is the very breath that sustains animal life, while glucose serves as a vital energy source. Photosynthesis, therefore, is the heartbeat of Earth's ecosystem, a testament to nature's ingenious design and our interconnectedness.
D1-284	We apply our general method of duality, introduced in [Giardina', Kurchan, Redig, J. Math. Phys. 48, 033301 (2007)], to models of population dynamics. The classical dualities between forward and ancestral processes can be viewed as a change of representation in the classical creation and annihilation operators, both for diffusions dual to coalescents of Kingman's type, as well as for models with finite population size. Next, using SU(1,1) raising and lowering operators, we find new dualities between the Wright-Fisher diffusion with $d$ types and the Moran model, both in presence and absence of mutations. These new dualities relates two forward evolutions. From our general scheme we also identify self-duality of the Moran model.
D1-285	 In the intricate world of genetics, a gene named P53 plays a pivotal role. Known as the 'Guardian of the Genome,' P53 controls cell division, preventing abnormal cells from multiplying and potentially becoming cancerous. It does this by detecting DNA damage and initiating cell repair mechanisms or, if damage is severe, triggering cell death. This gene's importance is underscored by the fact that mutations in P53 are linked to various types of cancer, making it a vital target for cancer research and therapy development.
D1-286	Self-sustained turbulent structures have been observed in a wide range of living fluids, yet no quantitative theory exists to explain their properties. We report experiments on active turbulence in highly concentrated 3D suspensions of Bacillus subtilis and compare them with a minimal fourth-order vector-field theory for incompressible bacterial dynamics. Velocimetry of bacteria and surrounding fluid, determined by imaging cells and tracking colloidal tracers, yields consistent results for velocity statistics and correlations over two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy, revealing a decrease of fluid memory with increasing swimming activity and linear scaling between energy and enstrophy. The best-fit model parameters allow for quantitative agreement with experimental data.
D1-287	 In the intricate world of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool. This innovative technology allows for precise editing of DNA sequences within living cells. As a result, it offers immense potential for treating genetic disorders, improving crop yields, and even combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Cas9 enzyme, paired with a guide RNA, targets specific sequences of DNA, introducing cuts that can be repaired, altering the genetic code. This groundbreaking method opens doors for manipulating and understanding the building blocks of life, promising a future where genetic diseases can be eradicated and life itself can be redefined.
D1-288	Soliton rate equations are based on non-Kolmogorovian models of probability and naturally include autocatalytic processes. The formalism is not widely known but has great unexplored potential for applications to systems interacting with environments. Beginning with links of contextuality to non-Kolmogorovity we introduce the general formalism of soliton rate equations and work out explicit examples of subsystems interacting with environments. Of particular interest is the case of a soliton autocatalytic rate equation coupled to a linear conservative environment, a formal way of expressing seasonal changes. Depending on strength of the system-environment coupling we observe phenomena analogous to hibernation or even complete blocking of decay of a population.
D1-289	 In the intricate realm of genetics, DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) serves as the blueprint for an organism's development. This double-helix molecule, crafted from nucleotides, carries the genetic instructions essential for growth, function, and reproduction. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. These bases pair up along the DNA strand, creating the sequence that encodes the genetic code. Each unique sequence, or genotype, dictates an organism's inherent traits, from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases. The study of genetics not only enhances our understanding of life's intricacies but also promises potential breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and conservation.
D1-290	In this manuscript we present an in vitro model based on agarose gel that can be used to simulate a dirty, oily, bloody, and morphologically complex surface of, for example, an open wound. We show this models effectiveness in simulating depth of penetration of reactive species generated in plasma deep into tissue of a rat and confirm the penetration depths with agarose gel model. We envision that in the future such a model could be used to study plasma discharges (and other modalities) and minimize the use of live animals: plasma can be optimized on the agarose gel wound model and then finally verified using an actual wound.
D1-291	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the Dumbo Octopus, showcases a captivating spectacle. This deep-sea dweller, resembling Disney's Dumbo due to its ear-like fins, illuminates its environment with a soft glow produced by light-emitting organs called photophores. This bioluminescence serves multiple purposes, including communication, attracting prey, and camouflage. By matching the intensity of their light to the surrounding water, they can disappear against the backdrop of the dark ocean, a remarkable adaptation to life in the deep sea.
D1-292	An evolutionary tree is a cascade of bifurcations starting from a single common root, generating a growing set of daughter species as time goes by. Species here is a general denomination for biological species, spoken languages or any other entity evolving through heredity. From the N currently alive species within a clade, distances are measured through pairwise comparisons made by geneticists, linguists, etc. The larger is such a distance for a pair of species, the older is their last common ancestor. The aim is to reconstruct the past unknown bifurcations, i.e. the whole clade, from the knowledge of the N(N-1)/2 quoted distances taken for granted. A mechanical method is presented, and its applicability discussed.
D1-293	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics, essentially, is the study of changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it revolves around modifications like methylation and acetylation of DNA and histone proteins, which can switch genes on or off, thus influencing an organism's development, behavior, and susceptibility to disease. These changes can be influenced by factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, adding a layer of complexity to our understanding of genetic inheritance. This dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics is revolutionizing our perspective on heredity and health.
D1-294	Ecological networks are often composed of different sub-communities (often referred to as modules). Identifying such modules has the potential to develop a better understanding of the assembly of ecological communities and to investigate functional overlap or specialisation. The most informative form of networks are quantitative or weighted networks. Here we introduce an algorithm to identify modules in quantitative bipartite (or two-mode) networks. It is based on the hierarchical random graphs concept of Clauset et al. (2008 Nature 453: 98-101) and is extended to include quantitative information and adapted to work with bipartite graphs. We define the algorithm, which we call QuaBiMo, sketch its performance on simulated data and illustrate its potential usefulness with a case study.
D1-295	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble fungi often play an overlooked yet crucial role. Fungi are non-plant organisms that thrive in diverse environments, from the soil to the forest floor, and even inside other organisms. They break down complex organic matter, recycling vital nutrients back into the ecosystem. Some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants, aiding in nutrient absorption through a mutualistic network known as mycorrhizae. Furthermore, fungi serve as the primary food source for many decomposers and scavengers, maintaining ecological balance. The study of fungi, mycology, unveils a fascinating world of adaptability, symbiosis, and ecological interdependence, reminding us of the intricate web of life that we inhabit.
D1-296	We, for the first time, report the detection and the size measurement of single nanoparticles (i.e. polystyrene) in aquatic environment using mode splitting in a whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical resonator, namely a microtoroid resonator. Using this method we achieved detecting and measuring individual synthetic hemozoin nanocrystals, which are a hemoglobin degradation by-product of malarial parasites, dispersed in a solution or in air. The results of size measurement in solution and in air agree with each other and with those obtained using scanning electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. Moreover, we compare the sensing capabilities of the degenerate (single resonance) and non-degenerate (split mode, doublet) operation regimes of the WGM resonator.
D1-297	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid displays a mesmerizing dance of light. As darkness falls, these cephalopods emit pulsating flashes from their body, using a chemical reaction in specialized light-producing organs called photophores. This glowing spectacle serves multiple purposes: camouflage, communication, and attraction of prey. By matching the intensity of their lights to the ambient moonlight, they become virtually invisible to predators lurking below. The intricate patterns of light they emit can convey specific messages to fellow squid. Moreover, the glowing trail left by a falling organism can lure unsuspecting prey into the waiting jaws of the squid, a testament to the marvelous adaptations that have evolved in the deep-sea realm.
D1-298	During recent years, dynamical decoupling (DD) has gained relevance as a tool for manipulating quantum systems and extracting information from them. This is particularly relevant for spins involved in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where DD sequences can be used to prolong quantum coherences, or for selectively couple/decouple the effects imposed by random environmental fluctuations. In this Letter, we show that one can exploit these concepts in order to selectively recouple diffusion processes in restricted spaces. The ensuing method provides a novel tool to measure restriction lengths in confined systems such as capillaries, pores or cells. The principles of this method for selectively recoupling diffusion-driven decoherence, its standing within the context of diffusion NMR, and corroborating experiments, are presented.
D1-299	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon, a spectacle of glowing organisms, illuminates the deep ocean's inky darkness. This natural light show is orchestrated by a chemical reaction within the creature's body, where the enzyme luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase. This reaction emits a cold light, often blue-green, serving various purposes from attracting prey to confounding predators. The mesmerizing dance of light in the abyssal depths remains a testament to nature's infinite creativity and adaptability.
D1-300	Using the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of folding fluxes in a two-dimensional space of collective variables, a potential of the driving force for protein folding is introduced. The potential has two components. One component is responsible for the source and sink of the folding flows, which represent, respectively, the unfolded states and the native state of the protein, and the other, which accounts for the flow vorticity inherently generated at the periphery of the flow field, is responsible for the canalization of the flow between the source and sink. The theoretical consideration is illustrated by calculations for a model $\beta$-hairpin protein.
D1-301	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton is crucial. These microscopic, photosynthetic organisms serve as the primary producers, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into organic matter. They form the base of the food chain, sustaining a myriad of marine life, from tiny zooplankton to large fish and even whales. Moreover, phytoplankton contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, absorbing carbon dioxide and helping mitigate climate change. However, their populations are under threat due to human activities, such as overfishing, pollution, and ocean acidification, which could disrupt the delicate balance of marine ecosystems and have far-reaching consequences for the planet.
D1-302	We study kinetic model of Nuclear Receptor Binding to Promoter Regions. This model is written as a system of ordinary differential equations. Model reduction techniques have been used to simplify chemical kinetics.In this case study, the technique of Pseudo-first order approximation is applied to simplify the reaction rates. CellDesigner has been used to draw the structures of chemical reactions of Nuclear Receptor Binding to Promoter Regions. After model reduction, the general analytical solution for reduced model is given and the number of species and reactions are reduced from 9 species and 6 reactions to 6 species and 5 reactions.
D1-303	 In botany, the process of pollination is a crucial step in plant reproduction. Pollen grains, produced in the anthers of a flower, are transported to the stigma of another flower, often by wind, insects, birds, or bats. This transfer facilitates fertilization, as the pollen carries the male gametes. Fertilization occurs when these gametes fuse with the egg cell in the ovule, resulting in the formation of a seed. This seed develops within the ovary, which eventually becomes the fruit, ensuring the plant's survival and dispersal of its offspring. Pollination is a delicate balance in ecosystems, as it supports both plant life and the pollinating species that rely on it for food and habitat.
D1-304	Various subsets of self-avoiding walks naturally appear when investigating existing methods designed to predict the 3D conformation of a protein of interest. Two such subsets, namely the folded and the unfoldable self-avoiding walks, are studied computationally in this article. We show that these two sets are equal and correspond to the whole $n$-step self-avoiding walks for $n\leqslant 14$, but that they are different for numerous $n \geqslant 108$, which are common protein lengths. Concrete counterexamples are provided and the computational methods used to discover them are completely detailed. A tool for studying these subsets of walks related to both pivot moves and proteins conformations is finally presented.
D1-305	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed as the 'powerhouses' of the cell, play a pivotal role. They are dynamic organelles responsible for generating energy in the form of ATP through a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria's dual membrane structure houses a series of enzymatic complexes that facilitate this energy production. Interestingly, mitochondria are believed to have originated from free-living bacteria that were engulfed by ancient eukaryotic cells, forming a symbiotic relationship that eventually became essential for complex life forms. This fascinating intracellular symbiont not only powers the cell but also participates in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and the regulation of cellular metabolism.
D1-306	"Motivated by DNA electrophoresis near a nanopore, we consider the flow field around an ""elongated jet"", a long thin source which injects momentum into a liquid. This solution qualitatively describes the electro-osmotic flow around a long rigid polymer, where due to electrohydrodynamic coupling, the solvent receives momentum from the electric field. Based on the qualitative behavior of the elongated jet solution, we develop a coarse-grained scheme which reproduces the known theoretical results regarding the electrophoretic behavior of a long rigid polymer and a polymer coil in a uniform field, which we then exploit to analyze the electrophoresis of a polymer coil in the non-uniform field near a nanopore."
D1-307	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds the intricate dance of DNA and RNA. The process of transcription, where DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis, is a pivotal step in protein production. This dance begins with RNA polymerase, a protein enzyme, binding to the DNA at the start site of a gene. As it moves along the DNA helix, RNA polymerase builds a complementary RNA strand, copying the DNA sequence. This transcribed RNA, a messenger, carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into proteins, thus shaping an organism's characteristics and functions. This dance of DNA and RNA is a testament to the complex, yet beautifully orchestrated, biochemical processes that govern life at its most fundamental level.
D1-308	Blood vessel constriction is simulated with particle-based method using a molecular dynamics authoring software known as Molecular Workbench (WM). Blood flow and vessel wall, the only components considered in constructing a blood vessel, are all represented in particle form with interaction potentials: Lennard-Jones potential, push-pull spring potential, and bending spring potential. Influence of medium or blood plasma is accommodated in plasma viscosity through Stokes drag force. It has been observed that pressure p is increased as constriction c is increased. Leakage of blood vessel starts at 80 % constriction, which shows existence of maximum pressure that can be overcome by vessel wall.
D1-309	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The process takes place in chloroplasts, within plant cells, and involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water, resulting in the production of oxygen as a byproduct. This life-sustaining process, essential for Earth's atmosphere, supports the survival of countless organisms, forming the foundation of our planet's diverse ecosystems.
D1-310	The motion of a rotating helical body in a viscoelastic fluid is considered. In the case of force-free swimming, the introduction of viscoelasticity can either enhance or retard the swimming speed and locomotive efficiency, depending on the body geometry, fluid properties, and the body rotation rate. Numerical solutions of the Oldroyd-B equations show how previous theoretical predictions break down with increasing helical radius or with decreasing filament thickness. Helices of large pitch angle show an increase in swimming speed to a local maximum at a Deborah number of order unity. The numerical results show how the small-amplitude theoretical calculations connect smoothly to the large-amplitude experimental measurements.
D1-311	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a fundamental process, the lifeblood of the plant kingdom. This biochemical marvel, occurring in chloroplasts, transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Photosystems I and II, the primary players, harvest solar energy and convert it into chemical energy, driving the synthesis of glucose. Oxygen, a byproduct, is released into the atmosphere, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere. Photosynthesis not only sustains the flora, but it also forms the basis of food chains, underpinning the entire web of life on Earth.
D1-312	We study the mean field approximation to a simple spatial host-pathogen model that has been shown to display interesting evolutionary properties. We show that previous derivations of the mean field equations for this model are actually only low-density approximations to the true mean field limit. We derive the correct equations and the corresponding equations including pair-correlations. The process of invasion by a mutant type of pathogen is also discussed. [This article was published as Physical Review E 67, 047102 (2003). Errata for the published version are corrected here and explicitly listed at the end of this document.]
D1-313	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery emerged: CRISPR-Cas9. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune systems, offers an unprecedented ability to edit DNA precisely. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, eradicate harmful pathogens within cells, and even manipulate genes to enhance specific traits in organisms. The potential applications are vast, ranging from curing genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even possibly slowing down aging processes. However, as with any powerful technology, ethical concerns arise. Balancing the promise of CRISPR-Cas9 with responsible usage is crucial, ensuring its benefits are harnessed while minimizing potential risks and maintaining the sanctity of life.
D1-314	We study a stochastic spatial model of biological competition in which two species have the same birth and death rates, but different diffusion constants. In the absence of this difference, the model can be considered as an off-lattice version of the Voter model and presents similar coarsening properties. We show that even a relative difference in diffusivity on the order of a few percent may lead to a strong bias in the coarsening process favoring the more agile species. We theoretically quantify this selective advantage and present analytical formulas for the average growth of the fastest species and its fixation probability.
D1-315	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating subject of study is epigenetics, a layer of regulation that influences gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. This phenomenon, often influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, can lead to changes in cellular function and potentially, developmental processes. For instance, an individual's dietary habits might impact the methylation patterns of certain genes, thereby influencing traits such as metabolic efficiency or risk of disease. This dynamic interplay between genes, environment, and time underscores the complexity and versatility of biological systems, offering endless opportunities for exploration and understanding.
D1-316	We study dynamics of a two-level system coupled simultaneously to a pair of dissimilar reservoirs, namely, a spin bath and a boson bath, which are connected via finite interbath coupling. It is found that the steady-state energy transfer in the two-level system increases with its coupling to the spin bath while optimal transfer occurs at intermediate coupling in the transient process. If the two-level system is strongly coupled to the spin bath, the population transfer is unidirectional barring minor population oscillations of minute amplitudes. If the spin bath is viewed as an atomic ensemble, robust generation of macroscopic superposition states exists against parameter variations of the two-level system and the boson bath.
D1-317	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a revolutionary tool. This innovative system allows for precise editing of DNA sequences, revolutionizing the way we manipulate genomes. By harnessing the power of this bacterial defense mechanism, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce desired traits, and even eradicate harmful pathogens within organisms. The potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 span across various fields, from medicine and agriculture to biotechnology and conservation, promising to reshape our understanding and interaction with life at the molecular level. However, ethical considerations, such as the potential misuse of this technology, call for thoughtful regulation and public discourse. The dawn of the CRISPR era marks a significant step in human progress, yet our approach must be guided by a deep respect for the biological world and a commitment to the responsible stewardship of this powerful new technology.
D1-318	To simulate long time and length scale processes involving DNA it is necessary to use a coarse-grained description. Here we provide an overview of different approaches to such coarse graining, focussing on those at the nucleotide level that allow the self-assembly processes associated with DNA nanotechnology to be studied. OxDNA, our recently-developed coarse-grained DNA model, is particularly suited to this task, and has opened up this field to systematic study by simulations. We illustrate some of the range of DNA nanotechnology systems to which the model is being applied, as well as the insights it can provide into fundamental biophysical properties of DNA.
D1-319	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating layer of complexity. Epigenetics refers to modifications in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. Instead, these changes are achieved through chemical tags attached to the DNA or histone proteins, thus influencing gene activity. These shifts can be influenced by various factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states, making epigenetics a crucial bridge between nature and nurture. Epigenetic alterations have profound implications in health and disease, providing promising avenues for potential therapies, as well as new insights into the intricate dance of genes and the factors that shape our biological destiny.
D1-320	The quantal release of catecholamines from neuroendocrine cells is a key mechanism which has been investigated with a broad range of materials and devices, among which carbon-based materials such as carbon fibers, diamond-like carbon, carbon nanotubes and nanocrystalline diamond. In the present work we demonstrate that a MeV-ion-microbeam lithographic technique can be successfully employed for the fabrication of an all-carbon miniaturized cellular bio-sensor based on graphitic micro-channels embedded in a single-crystal diamond matrix. The device was functionally characterized for the in vitro recording of quantal exocytic events from single chromaffin cells, with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, opening promising perspectives for the realization of monolithic all-carbon cellular biosensors.
D1-321	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis emerges as a vital ballet, an essential symphony played out by plants. Through this process, green leaves transform sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen, a lifeline for most organisms, underscores photosynthesis's integral role in the global ecosystem. Photosynthesis is not merely a plant's sustenance. it is a life-giving force, a testament to nature's intricate symphony of survival and growth.
D1-322	A new type of metabolizable and efficient radiosensitizer for cancer radiotherapy is presented in this study by combining ultrasmall Au nanoclusters (NCs, <2 nm) with biocompatible coating ligands (glutathione, GSH). The new nano-construct (GSH-coated Au25 NCs) inherits attractive features of both the Au core (strong radiosensitizing effect) and GSH shell (good biocompatibility). It can preferentially accumulate in tumor via the improved EPR effect, which leads to strong enhancement for cancer radiotherapy. After the treatment, the small-sized GSH-Au25 NCs can be efficiently cleared by the kidney, minimizing any potential side effects due to the accumulation of Au25 NCs in the body.
D1-323	 In marine ecosystems, the relationship between sea otters and kelp forests is a prime example of keystone species impact. Sea otters, with their dexterous paws, efficiently hunt urchins, controlling their populations. Unchecked, urchins graze on kelp, damaging and reducing the forest. Conversely, a healthy kelp forest provides crucial habitat and food for numerous marine organisms, offering shelter, protection, and promoting biodiversity. The balance between these species is a delicate dance that plays a significant role in the overall health of the ocean's ecosystems. The decline or disappearance of sea otters can lead to overpopulation of urchins and the subsequent loss of kelp forests, disrupting the entire underwater community.
D1-324	We consider a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model with a contact rate that fluctuates seasonally. Through the use of a nonlinear, stochastic projection, we are able to analytically determine the lower dimensional manifold on which the deterministic and stochastic dynamics correctly interact. Our method produces a low dimensional stochastic model that captures the same timing of disease outbreak and the same amplitude and phase of recurrent behavior seen in the high dimensional model. Given seasonal epidemic data consisting of the number of infectious individuals, our method enables a data-based model prediction of the number of unobserved exposed individuals over very long times.
D1-325	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, the intriguing RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism plays a crucial role in gene regulation. This double-stranded RNA-based process silences specific genes, akin to a genetic dimmer switch. Triggered by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs), RNAi guides a protein complex called the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) to degrade mRNA transcripts or inhibit their translation. This fundamental process controls various cellular activities, from development and differentiation to stress responses, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer and genetic diseases.
D1-326	Several variations of the Watterson estimator of variability for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have been proposed in the literature. We present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators based on Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the existing estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as generalized Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data, including pools and trios. We also discuss the relation with the estimators that have been proposed in the literature and show that they admit two equivalent but seemingly different forms, deriving a set of combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we give a detailed treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple autopolyploid individuals.
D1-327	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a captivating spectacle, where certain deep-sea organisms emit a soft, ethereal light. This light is produced through a chemical reaction within their bodies, known as chemiluminescence. The enzyme luciferin, combined with oxygen and ATP, triggers the emission of light. This ability allows these creatures to communicate, attract prey, or evade predators in the dark, vast ocean depths. Bioluminescence is a mesmerizing testament to nature's infinite diversity and the extraordinary adaptations of life in the underwater world.
D1-328	We study the effects of the shear force on the rupture mechanism on a double stranded DNA. Motivated by recent experiments, we perform the atomistic simulations with explicit solvent to obtain the distributions of extension in hydrogen and covalent bonds below the rupture force. We obtain a significant difference between the atomistic simulations and the existing results in the iterature based on the coarse-grained models (theory and simulations). We discuss the possible reasons and improve the coarse-grained model by incorporating the consequences of semi-microscopic details of the nucleotides in its description. The distributions obtained by the modified model (simulations and theoretical) are qualitatively similar to the one obtained using atomistic simulations.
D1-329	 In botany, the meristematic tissues play a crucial role in plant growth and development. Located at the tips of roots and shoots, these dynamic zones are responsible for cell division and differentiation. The apical meristem, found at the tip of the root and shoot, is the primary site for elongation growth. Meanwhile, the lateral meristem, like the cambium in trees, controls the growth in thickness. Additionally, the intercalary meristem, found in certain regions of the plant, acts as a reserve for growth, providing a mechanism for regeneration and repair when needed. These essential tissues ensure the continuous growth and adaptability of plants, enabling them to thrive in diverse environments.
D1-330	The influence of migration on the stochastic dynamics of subdivided populations is still an open issue in various evolutionary models. We develop here a self-consistent mean-field-like method in order to determine the effects of migration on relevant nonequilibrium properties, such as the mean fixation time. If evolution strongly favors coexistence of species (e.g., balancing selection), the mean fixation time develops an unexpected minimum as a function of the migration rate. Our analysis hinges only on the presence of a separation of time scales between local and global dynamics and therefore it carries over to other nonequilibrium processes in physics, biology, ecology, and social sciences.
D1-331	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, a process carried out by green plants and some microorganisms, plays a pivotal role. It's a symphony of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, resulting in glucose and oxygen. The chlorophyll within plant cells captures sunlight, converting it into chemical energy. Water molecules split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for all aerobic life forms. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide is transformed into glucose, the primary energy source for plants and the foundation for the global food web. This seemingly simple process is, in reality, a complex, interdependent ballet that sustains our planet's biodiversity and life cycles.
D1-332	Relevance of mode coupling to energy/information transfer during protein function, particularly in the context of allosteric interactions is widely accepted. However, existing evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes essentially from model systems. We here report a novel formal analysis of the near-native dynamics of myosin II, which allows us to explore the impact of the interaction between possibly non-Gaussian vibrational modes on fluctutational dynamics. We show that, an information-theoretic measure based on mode coupling {\it alone} yields a ranking of residues with a statistically significant bias favoring the functionally critical locations identified by experiments on myosin II.
D1-333	 In the realm of genetics, gene editing holds immense potential. Through precise manipulation of DNA sequences, scientists can alter or correct genetic defects. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool, allows for targeted modification, offering hope for diseases like cystic fibrosis and Huntington's. However, ethical debates arise over potential misuse, such as genetically enhancing human offspring, blurring lines between natural and engineered life. Balancing progress with responsibility becomes crucial, ensuring advancements in gene editing lead to a future where health is improved, not a select few elevated above the rest.
D1-334	The model analyzes the muscle fiber as a deformable system for which experimental data are determinated with the help of the laws of Newtonian mechanic. The model predicts the four transient phases for the shortening of a muscle fiber according to a force or length step. The model shows, on the one hand, the importance of the viscosity during the first phase of these two types of step and, secondly, the interdependence of the six other phases towards a bimodal state after disappearance of actions due to viscosity. The model provides an interpretation for the behavior of a fiber with shortening staircase. The model is consistent with experimental data during temperature changes or various structural alterations.
D1-335	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This process, carried out by plants and some microorganisms, is the primary source of energy for most life forms on Earth. Photosynthesis not only fuels life but also regulates the planet's oxygen levels and carbon cycle, making it an essential biogeochemical process. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for various ecological interactions and offers potential for innovative bioengineering solutions, such as carbon capture technologies. The delicate balance and far-reaching impacts of photosynthesis underscore its indispensable role in the sustenance and evolution of life on our planet.
D1-336	We employ the adaptive resolution approach AdResS, in its recently developed Grand Canonical-like version (GC-AdResS) [Wang et al. Phys.Rev.X 3, 011018 (2013)], to calculate the excess chemical potential, $\mu^{ex}$, of various liquids and mixtures. We compare our results with those obtained from full atomistic simulations using the technique of thermodynamic integration and show a satisfactory agreement. In GC-AdResS the procedure to calculate $\mu^{ex}$ corresponds to the process of standard initial equilibration of the system. this implies that, independently of the specific aim of the study, $\mu^{ex}$, for each molecular species, is automatically calculated every time a GC-AdResS simulation is performed.
D1-337	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. This biochemical process, performed by green plants and algae, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs in specialized structures called chloroplasts within plant cells. During the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is captured and stored in ATP and NADPH molecules. In the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, these energy-rich molecules facilitate the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide. This process is not only essential for the survival of plants, but it also serves as the primary source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, making it possible for aerobic organisms to thrive. Furthermore, photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, helping to mitigate climate change by reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
D1-338	In the study of the evolution of cooperation, resource limitations are usually assumed just to provide a finite population size. Recently, however, it has been pointed out that resource limitation may also generate dynamical payoffs able to modify the original structure of the games. Here we study analytically a phase transition from a homogeneous population of defectors when resources are abundant to the survival of unconditional cooperators when resources reduce below a threshold. To this end, we introduce a model of simple agents, with no memory or ability of recognition, interacting in well-mixed populations. The result might shed light on the role played by resource constraints on the origin of multicellularity.
D1-339	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green lung of our planet. This biochemical miracle, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose fuels the organism, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere, sustaining the respiration of diverse organisms and contributing to the oxygen-rich environment that supports an array of life forms. Photosynthesis not only underpins the survival of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems but also serves as the foundation of our global food chain, making it an indispensable force driving the balance of life on Earth.
D1-340	We introduce a system of pulse coupled oscillators that can change both their phases and frequencies. and prove that when there is a separation of time scales between phase and frequency adjustment the system converges to exact synchrony on strongly connected graphs with time delays. The analysis involves decomposing the network into a forest of tree-like structures that capture causality. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound for the size of the basin of attraction with immediate implications for empirical networks and random graph models. These results provide a robust method of sensor net synchronization as well as demonstrate a new avenue of possible pulse coupled oscillator research.
D1-341	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of bacteriophages, or phages, has garnered significant attention. These are viruses that infect bacteria, offering a potential solution to antibiotic resistance. Phages are incredibly diverse, with estimates suggesting millions of different types, each specifically targeting a unique bacterial host. Due to this specificity, they can eliminate harmful bacteria without affecting the host organism, making them promising antibacterial agents. Furthermore, bacteria often struggle to develop resistance to phages as swiftly as they do to antibiotics. This adaptability and specificity make bacteriophages a promising frontier in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
D1-342	Water molecules play an important role in providing unique environments for biological reactions on cell membranes. It is widely believed that water molecules form bridges that connect lipid molecules and stabilize cell membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that translational and rotational diffusion of water molecules on lipid membrane surfaces exhibit subdiffusion. Moreover, we provide evidence that both divergent mean trapping time (continuous-time random walk) and long-correlated noise (fractional Brownian motion) contribute to this subdiffusion. These results suggest that subdiffusion on cell membranes causes the water retardation, an enhancement of cell membrane stability, and a higher reaction efficiency.
D1-343	 In marine ecosystems, the kelp forest serves as a vital and intricate habitat. These underwater gardens, teeming with life, are anchored by giant kelp seaweed. They offer shelter for a multitude of species, from fish and invertebrates to a variety of marine mammals. The kelp forest's structure plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, providing food, and aiding in the reproduction of numerous marine organisms. Furthermore, the kelp's holdfast helps to prevent coastal erosion by absorbing wave energy, while its decaying matter contributes to nutrient cycling. However, the kelp forest faces threats such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing, jeopardizing its delicate balance and the countless species it supports. Conservation efforts are essential to protect and preserve these critical underwater ecosystems.
D1-344	Constitutive equations for a one-dimensional, active, polar, viscoelastic liquid are derived by treating the strain field as a slow hydrodynamic variable. Taking into account the couplings between strain and polarity allowed by symmetry, the hydrodynamics of an active, polar, viscoelastic body include an evolution equation for the polarity field that generalizes the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Beyond thresholds of the active coupling coefficients between the polarity and the stress or the strain rate, bifurcations of the homogeneous state lead first to stationary waves, then to propagating waves of the strain, stress and polarity fields. I argue that these results are relevant to living matter, and may explain rotating actomyosin rings in cells and mechanical waves in epithelial cell monolayers.
D1-345	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining life on Earth. This bio-chemical miracle, primarily executed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process not only fuels the organisms themselves but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, supporting the respiration of other life forms. Photosynthesis's efficiency, regulated by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels, is crucial for maintaining Earth's carbon and oxygen balance, thereby underpinning the survival of a myriad of species.
D1-346	Interactive molecular graphics applications facilitate analysis of three dimensional protein structures. Naturally, non-interactive 2-D snapshots of the protein structures do not convey the same level of geometric detail. Several 2-D visualization methods have been in use to summarize structural information, including contact maps and 2-D cartoon views. We present a new approach for 2-D visualization of protein structures where amino acid residues are displayed on a circle and spatially close residues are depicted by links. Furthermore, residue-specific properties, such as conservation, accessibility, temperature factor, can be displayed as plots on the same circular view.
D1-347	 In the intricate world of cellular processes, the role of enzymes is paramount. These biological catalysts accelerate chemical reactions within cells, enabling life's complex biochemical Transformations. Enzymes are proteins with a unique three-dimensional structure, which defines their specific reactant binding sites and catalytic activity. The active site of an enzyme interacts with its substrate, a molecule that undergoes change upon catalysis. This enzyme-substrate complex is a crucial step in the cascade of reactions that form the backbone of life, from metabolism to DNA replication. The efficiency and specificity of enzymes are crucial for maintaining homeostasis, ensuring the ordered dance of cellular functions that keep life thriving.
D1-348	Single and collective cellular oscillations involving the actomyosin cytoskeleton have been observed in numerous biological systems. We show here that a generic model of a contractile material, which is turning over and contracts against an elastic element, exhibits spontaneous oscillations. Such a model can thus account for shape oscillations observed in amnioserosa cells during dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. We investigate the collective dynamics of an ensemble of such oscillators and show that the relative contribution of viscous and friction losses yield different regimes of collective oscillations. Taking into account the diffusion of contractile elements, our theoretical framework predicts the appearance of traveling waves which might account for the propagation of actomyosin contractile waves observed during morphogenesis.
D1-349	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that is stored in carbohydrate molecules. The equation summarizing this process is straightforward: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. This transformation not only sustains the producer organisms but also serves as the primary source of oxygen for most life forms on Earth, making photosynthesis a vital link in the global carbon and oxygen cycles. It's a testament to nature's ingenious design, a continuous cycle of life and energy, and a reminder of our profound interconnectedness with the environment.
D1-350	Atomistic simulations were performed on hydrated model lipid multilayers that are representative of the lipid matrix in the outer skin (stratum corneum). We find that cholesterol transfers easily between adjacent leaflets belonging to the same bilayer via fast orientational diffusion (tumbling) in the inter-leaflet disordered region, while at the same time there is a large free energy cost against swelling. This fast flip-flop may play an important role in accommodating the variety of curvatures that would be required in the three dimensional arrangement of the lipid multilayers in skin, and for enabling mechanical or hydration induced strains without large curvature elastic costs.
D1-351	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, conducted by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, while oxygen is the byproduct released into the atmosphere. This continuous cycle, known as the carbon cycle, not only sustains life on Earth but also regulates our planet's climate, making photosynthesis a vital link between the biosphere and the atmosphere.
D1-352	We describe the effect of optical aberrations on fluorescence fluctuations microscopy (FFM), when focusing through a single living cell. FFM measurements are performed in an aqueous fluorescent solution and prove to be a highly sensitive tool to assess the optical aberrations introduced by the cell. We demonstrate an adaptive optics (AO) system to remove the aberration-related bias in the FFM measurements. Our data show that AO is not only useful when imaging deep in tissues but also when performing FFM measurements through a single cellular layer. This work paves the way for the application of FFM to complex three-dimensional multicellular samples.
D1-353	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteria play a pivotal role in decomposing organic matter, thereby aiding in the recycling of nutrients in ecosystems. Some bacteria, like nitrifying bacteria, convert ammonia into nitrites and then into nitrates, an essential process in agriculture for increasing soil fertility. Conversely, other bacteria, such as pathogenic ones, can cause diseases in both animals and humans, underscoring their dual nature. Probiotics, friendly bacteria, are beneficial to our health, aiding digestion, boosting immunity, and even influencing our mood. Understanding and harnessing the power of bacteria can lead to innovative solutions in medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation.
D1-354	Transitions in the qualitative behavior of chemical reaction dynamics with a decrease in molecule number have attracted much attention. Here, a method based on a Markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix is applied to the analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics. The transition to bistability due to the small-number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable states are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations. In addition, a novel transition involving the reversal of the chemical reaction flow is found in the model under an external flow, and also in a three-component model. The generality of this transition and its correspondence to biological phenomena are also discussed.
D1-355	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a compelling, layered phenomenon. Epigenetics, essentially, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications can be influenced by various factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. For instance, a nutrient-rich diet may activate genes that promote cell growth and health, while a poor diet could suppress these same genes. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores our complex biological journey, offering insights into disease prevention, personalized medicine, and the vast potential for epigenetic therapies in the future.
D1-356	Measures of erythrocytes volume and surface are helpful in several physiological studies, both for zoologists and veterinarians. Whilst diameter and volume are assessed with ease from observations of blood smears and complete blood count, respectively, thickness and surface area, instead, are much more difficult to be obtained. The accurate description of the erythrocyte geometry is given by the equation of the oval of Cassini, but the formulas deriving from it are very complex, comprising elliptic integrals. In this article three solids are proposed as models approximating the erythrocyte: sphere, cylinder and a spheroid with concave caps. Volumes and Surface Areas obtained with these models are compared to those effectively measured.
D1-357	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a mesmerizing spectacle. Certain deep-sea organisms, such as jellyfish, squids, and some species of fish, possess the ability to produce and emit light. This captivating display serves multiple purposes, including attracting prey, deterring predators, and communicating with fellow species. The light is generated within the organisms through a chemical reaction involving luciferin, a light-emitting molecule, and an enzyme called luciferase. The energy released in this reaction is in the form of light, illuminating the dark abyss of the ocean depths.
D1-358	In this communication, we propose a model to study the non-equilibrium process by which actin stress fibers develop force in contractile cells. The emphasis here is on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is necessary to address the mechanics as well as the chemistry of dynamic cell contractility. In this setting we are able to develop a framework that relates (a) the dynamics of force generation within the cell and (b) the cell response to external stimuli to the chemical processes occurring within the cell, as well as to the mechanics of linkage between the stress fibers, focal adhesions and extra-cellular matrix.
D1-359	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often likened to the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role. These double-membrane organelles are responsible for generating most of the ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of a cell. They also contribute to apoptosis, a controlled cell death process essential for development and homeostasis. Mitochondria's dynamic nature, characterized by continuous fusion and fission events, ensures their optimal distribution and function within the cell. The genetic material within mitochondria, distinct from the nucleus, carries its own set of genes, primarily coding for essential proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The study of mitochondria offers fascinating insights into cellular metabolism, evolution, and disease mechanisms, making them a captivating subject for biologists.
D1-360	Inside cells, various cargos are transported by teams of molecular motors. Intriguingly, the motors involved generally have opposite pulling directions, and the resulting cargo dynamics is a biased stochastic motion. It is an open question how the cell can control this bias. Here we develop a model which takes explicitly into account the elastic coupling of the cargo with each motor. We show that bias can be simply controlled or even reversed in a counterintuitive manner via a change in the external force exerted on the cargo or a variation of the ATP binding rate to motors. Furthermore, the superdiffusive behavior found at short time scales indicates the emergence of motor cooperation induced by cargo-mediated coupling.
D1-361	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, a process performed by plants and some microorganisms, plays a pivotal role. By harnessing sunlight's energy, chlorophyll absorbs, converts, and stores solar power as chemical energy within organic molecules, primarily glucose. This process, occurring in chloroplasts, not only fuels the organism but also generates oxygen as a byproduct, an essential element for respiration in most aerobic life forms. Thus, photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process, sustaining life on Earth by maintaining the carbon and oxygen cycles, and providing the basis for our planet's ecosystems.
D1-362	Modeling of DNA-protein interactions is a complex process involving many important time and length scales. This can be facilitated through the use of coarse-grained models which reduce the number of degrees of freedom and allow efficient exploration of binding configurations. It is known that the local structure of DNA can significantly affect its protein-binding properties (i.e. intrinsic curvature in DNA-histone complexes). In a step towards comprehensive DNA-protein modeling, we expand the 3SPN.2 coarse-grained model to include intrinsic shape, and validate the refined model against experimental data including melting temperature, local flexibility, persistence length, and minor groove width profile.
D1-363	 In the intricate world of genetics, the gene plays a pivotal role, acting as the fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene, a segment of DNA, carries coded instructions for a specific protein or functional molecule. These instructions are transcribed during gene expression, a process that involves the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequent translation of the mRNA sequence into a protein within the ribosomes. Genes, thus, dictate an organism's characteristics, from eye color to height, and are instrumental in understanding hereditary traits, disorders, and evolution. The study of genetics offers a profound insight into the blueprint of life, bridging the gap between biology and human understanding.
D1-364	In order to describe two-dimensionally packed cells in epithelial tissues both mathematically and physically, there have been developed several sorts of geometrical models, such as the vertex model, the finite element model, the cell-centered model, the cellular Potts model. So far, in any case, pressures have not neatly been dealt with and curvatures of the cell boundaries have been even omitted through their approximations. We focus on these quantities and formulate them on the vertex model. Thus, a model with the curvatures is constructed and its algorithm is given for simulation. Its possible extensions and applications will also be discussed.
D1-365	 In the vast realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent octopus captivates our imagination. Equipped with light-producing cells called photophores, these cephalopods illuminate the ocean's depths, creating a mesmerizing display of flashes and pulses. This natural light show serves dual purposes – camouflage and communication. By matching the glow of surrounding organisms, the bioluminescent octopus can blend into the environment, avoiding predators. Yet, it can also manipulate these lights to signal mates or warn rivals. This enigmatic creature, painted with tiny stars, adds a touch of magic to the dark abyss of the sea.
D1-366	Is the brain really operating at a critical point? We study the non-equilibrium properties of a neural network which models the dynamics of the neocortex and argue for optimal quasi-critical dynamics on the Widom line where the correlation length is maximal. We simulate the network and introduce an analytical mean-field approximation, characterize the non-equilibrium phase transition, and present a non-equilibrium phase diagram, which shows that in addition to an ordered and disordered phase, the system exhibits a quasiperiodic phase corresponding to synchronous activity in simulations which may be related to the pathological synchronization associated with epilepsy.
D1-367	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucial role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not just vibrant additions to coral reefs. they are a vital link in the food chain. Sea anemones feed on zooplankton, small fish, and other marine invertebrates captured by their stinging tentacles. But they also host a mutualistic relationship with the anemonefish, offering protection from predators in exchange for the fish's role in cleaning parasites from the anemone's body. This symbiosis exemplifies the intricate web of life within our oceans, where each organism, no matter its size, contributes to the overall health and balance of the ecosystem.
D1-368	Noise induced excitability is studied in type I and II Morris-Lecar neurons subject to constant sub threshold input, where fluctuations arise from sodium and potassium ion channels. Ion channels open and close randomly, creating current fluctuations that can induce spontaneous firing of action potentials. Both noise sources are assumed to be weak so that spontaneous action potentials occur on a longer timescale than ion channel fluctuations. Asymptotic approximations of the stationary density function and most probable paths are developed to understand the role of channel noise in spontaneous excitability. Even though the deterministic dynamical behavior of type I and II action potentials differ, results show that a single mechanism explains how ion channel noise generates spontaneous action potentials.
D1-369	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the way we edit DNA. This revolutionary tool allows scientists to precisely modify genomes, correcting genetic defects and altering traits. With CRISPR, we can target specific sequences of DNA, introducing precise changes or even snipping out disease-causing genes. This technology offers immense promise for treating genetic disorders, improving crop yields, and even tackling infectious diseases at their roots. However, ethical considerations arise when discussing human germline editing, as the changes could be passed down to future generations. As we delve deeper into this fascinating field, striking a balance between scientific advancement and ethical responsibility becomes paramount.
D1-370	Breast cancer has been reported to account for the maximum cases among all female cancers till date. In order to gain a deeper insight into the complexities of the disease, we analyze the breast cancer network and its normal counterpart at the proteomic level. While the short range correlations in the eigenvalues exhibiting universality provide an evidence towards the importance of random connections in the underlying networks, the long range correlations along with the localization properties reveal insightful structural patterns involving functionally important proteins. The analysis provides a benchmark for designing drugs which can target a subgraph instead of individual proteins.
D1-371	 In marine biology, the giant squid (Architeuthis dux) remains an enigmatic creature. Known for its massive eyes and tentacles, this elusive cephalopod inhabits the deep, dark ocean depths. Reaching up to 43 feet in length, it's one of the largest invertebrates, surpassing even the blue whale in terms of the size of its eyes. Despite numerous sightings and captured carcasses, the live giant squid has evaded scientists, making our knowledge of its behavior and life cycle limited. Research continues using remote-operated vehicles and DNA analysis to further unravel the mysteries of this fascinating, colossal denizen of the deep sea.
D1-372	Nowadays massive amount of data are available for analysis in natural and social systems. Inferring system structures from the data, i.e., the inverse problem, has become one of the central issues in many disciplines and interdisciplinary studies. In this Letter, we study the inverse problem of stochastic dynamic complex networks. We derive analytically a simple and universal inference formula called double correlation matrix (DCM) method. Numerical simulations confirm that the DCM method can accurately depict both network structures and noise correlations by using available kinetic data only. This inference performance was never regarded possible by theoretical derivation, numerical computation and experimental design.
D1-373	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, crucial for cell division and growth, is a marvel of biology. Each strand of the double helix serves as a template for its counterpart, with enzymes meticulously unzipping the strands. Nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, are then assembled in the correct sequence, guided by the template strand. Once a new complementary strand is complete, two complete double helices emerge, each carrying the identical genetic information as the original. This intricate dance ensures the continuity of life, passing on genetic instructions from one generation to the next.
D1-374	The marriage of two vibrant fields---photonics and neuromorphic processing---is fundamentally enabled by the strong analogies within the underlying physics between the dynamics of biological neurons and lasers, both of which can be understood within the framework of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Whereas neuromorphic engineering exploits the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms to provide a wide range of computing and signal processing applications, photonics offer an alternative approach to neuromorphic systems by exploiting the high speed, high bandwidth, and low crosstalk available to photonic interconnects which potentially grants the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making. Here we highlight some recent progress on this exciting field.
D1-375	 In the fascinating realm of biology, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different organisms, proves to be a pivotal force in the intricate web of life. For instance, consider the relationship between termites and protozoa. Termites, unable to digest cellulose, rely on protozoa harbored within their gut, which break down this complex carbohydrate, enabling termites to flourish in wood-rich environments. Similarly, coral and algae form a symbiotic union known as a symbiosis, with the algae photosynthesizing and providing the coral with nutrients, while the coral provides the algae with a protective habitat and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. These partnerships underscore the interconnectedness of life on our planet, highlighting the beauty and complexity of the biological world.
D1-376	We present a microscopic model of a disordered viscoelastic active solid, i.e. an active material whose long time behaviour is elastic as opposed to viscous. It is composed of filaments, passive crosslinks and molecular motors powered by stored chemical energy, e.g. actomyosin powered by ATP. Our model allows us to study the collective behaviour of contractile active elements and how their interaction with each other and the passive elastic elements determines the macroscopic mechanical properties of the active material. As a result of the (un)binding dynamics of the active elements, we find that this system provides a highly responsive material with a dynamic mechanical response strongly dependent on the amount of deformation.
D1-377	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly influence an organism's traits. These minor differences in DNA sequence, occurring frequently across the genome, can subtly alter protein structure and function, leading to diverse phenotypic expressions. For instance, the APOE4 SNP, found in the Apolipoprotein E gene, is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, the CCR5-Δ32 mutation, in the chemokine receptor gene, provides a natural resistance to HIV in some populations. Such genetic variations, though seemingly insignificant, play crucial roles in shaping biological diversity and health outcomes.
D1-378	Radical-ion-pair reactions, central in photosynthesis and the avian magnetic compass mechanism, have recently shown to be a paradigm system for applying quantum information science in a biochemical setting. The fundamental quantum master equation describing radical-ion-pair reactions is still under debate. We here use quantum retrodiction to produce a rigorous refinement of the theory put forward in Phys. Rev. E {\bf 83}, 056118 (2011). We also provide a rigorous analysis of the measure of singlet-triplet coherence required for deriving the radical-pair master equation. A Monte-Carlo simulation with single-molecule quantum trajectories supports the self-consistency of our approach.
D1-379	 In botany, photosynthesis is a fundamental process that underpins life on Earth. This biochemical reaction, primarily conducted by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose serves as an energy source for the organism, while the oxygen is essential for most aerobic life forms. Photosynthesis is divided into two phases: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, collectively known as the Calvin cycle. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, while the Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma. This intricate dance of biochemistry is vital to our planet's life-sustaining oxygen cycle and food web.
D1-380	Applications of first passage times in stochastic processes arise across a wide range of length and time scales in biological settings. After an initial technical overview, we survey representative applications and their corresponding models. Within models that are effectively Markovian, we discuss canonical examples of first passage problems spanning applications to molecular dissociation and self-assembly, molecular search, transcription and translation, neuronal spiking, cellular mutation and disease, and organismic evolution and population dynamics. In this last application, a simple model for stem-cell ageing is presented and some results derived. Various approximation methods and the physical and mathematical subtleties that arise in the chosen applications are also discussed.
D1-381	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a revolutionary tool. This innovative technology allows precise editing of DNA sequences, opening doors for potential therapies and fundamental research. By mimicking bacterial immunity mechanisms, researchers can correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, or even eliminate harmful viral infections within cells. This gene-editing technique holds immense promise for treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and various forms of inherited blindness. Its potential applications extend beyond medicine, promising solutions for crop disease resistance and environmental conservation by altering the genetic makeup of organisms. The CRISPR-Cas9 system represents a monumental leap in our ability to manipulate and understand the very building blocks of life.
D1-382	We study genetic networks that produce many species of non-coding RNA molecules that are present at a moderate density, as typically exists in the cell. The associations of the many species of these RNA are modeled physically, taking into account the equilibrium constants between bound and unbound states. By including the pair-wise binding of the many RNA species, the network becomes highly interconnected and shows different properties than the usual type of genetic network. It shows much more robustness to mutation, and also rapid evolutionary adaptation in an environment that oscillates in time. This provides a possible explanation for the weak evolutionary constraints seen in much of the non-coding RNA that has been studied.
D1-383	 In the realm of microbiology, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes, distinct domains of life, coexist and contribute significantly to Earth's biodiversity. Prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are single-celled organisms without a defined nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. They are the smallest and most abundant life forms, thriving in diverse environments, from soil to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, encompass multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi, as well as single-celled organisms like protists. Eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex, with a distinct nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, allowing for specialized functions that facilitate the intricate processes necessary for life, such as photosynthesis and muscle contractions. The dynamics between these two domains shape our world in countless ways, from the decomposition of waste to the production of oxygen.
D1-384	Experiments show that macromolecular crowding modestly reduces the size of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) even at volume fraction ($\phi$) similar to that in the cytosol whereas DNA undergoes a coil-to-globule transition at very small $\phi$. We show using a combination of scaling arguments and simulations that the polymer size $\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ depends on $x = \overline{R}_g(0)/D$ where $D$ is the $\phi$-dependent distance between the crowders. If $x\lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$, there is only a small decrease in $\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ as $\phi$ increases. When $x\gg \mathcal{O}(1)$, a cooperative coil-to-globule transition is induced. Our theory quantitatively explains a number of experiments.
D1-385	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a pivotal role is played by DNA, the hereditary material. It encodes the instructions for an organism's development and functions, housed within the cell's nucleus. DNA's double helix structure, a testament to its unique chemical makeup, is composed of nucleotides, each containing a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair precisely, guanine with cytosine, and adenine with thymine, ensuring the integrity of the genetic code. This complex dance of nucleotides, intricately woven into the DNA double helix, underpins the very essence of life, dictating the traits we inherit and the proteins our cells produce.
D1-386	A three-dimensional hydrodynamical model for a micro random walker is combined with the idea of chemotactic signaling network of E. coli. Diffusion exponents, orientational correlation functions and their dependence on the geometrical and dynamical parameters of the system are analyzed numerically. Because of the chemotactic memory, the walker shows superdiffusing displacements in all directions with the largest diffusion exponent for a direction along the food gradient. Mean square displacements and orientational correlation functions show that the chemotactic memory washes out all the signatures due to the geometrical asymmetry of the walker and statistical properties are asymmetric only with respect to the direction of food gradient. For different values of the memory time, the Chemotactic index (CI) is also calculated.
D1-387	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating offshoot. Epigenetics refers to modifications in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can be passed down from one cell generation to another, shaping phenotypic traits in ways that are not typically associated with genetic coding alone. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, play crucial roles in cell differentiation, development, and even responses to stress or disease. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems, opening new avenues for understanding the intricacies of heredity and health.
D1-388	We investigate in vitro fibrillation kinetics of the hormone peptide glucagon at various concentrations using confocal microscopy and determine the glucagon fibril persistence length $60 \mu\textrm{m}$. At all concentrations we observe that periods of individual fibril growth are interrupted by periods of stasis. The growth probability is large at high and low concentrations and is reduced for intermediate glucagon concentrations. To explain this behavior we propose a simple model, where fibrils come in two forms, one built entirely from glucagon monomers and one entirely from glucagon trimers. The opposite building blocks act as fibril growth blockers, and this generic model reproduces experimental behavior well.
D1-389	 In the intricate realm of microbiology, probiotics emerge as beneficial microorganisms residing within our bodies, particularly in the gut. They serve a crucial role in maintaining a healthy balance with other microbes, bolstering immune function, aiding digestion, and even influencing our overall well-being. Probiotics are often found in fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi, or available as dietary supplements. By fostering a symbiotic relationship with our bodies, these microscopic allies contribute significantly to our health, underscoring the profound connection between our gut microbiota and overall wellness.
D1-390	We propose a novel OCT-based method for visualizing microvasculature in 3D using reference-free processing of individual complex-valued B-scans with highly overlapped A-scans. In the lateral direction of such a B-scan, the amplitude and phase of speckles corresponding to vessel regions exhibit faster variability, and thus can be detected without comparison with other B-scans recorded in the same plane. This method combines elements of several existing OCT angiographic approaches, and exhibits: (i) enhanced robustness with respect to bulk tissue motion with frequencies up to tens of Hz. (ii) resolution of microcirculation images equal to that of structural images and (iii) possibility of quantifying the vessels in terms of their decorrelation rates.
D1-391	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold profound implications. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at seemingly insignificant positions, can subtly alter protein structure and function.

However, the stability of homochiral states in deterministic autocatalytic systems relies on cross inhibition of the two chiral states, an unlikely scenario for early life self-replicators. Here, we present a theory for a stochastic individual-level model of autocatalysis due to early life self-replicators. Without chiral inhibition, the racemic state is the global attractor of the deterministic dynamics, but intrinsic multiplicative noise stabilizes the homochiral states, in both well-mixed and spatially-extended systems. We conclude that autocatalysis is a viable mechanism for homochirality, without imposing additional nonlinearities such as chiral inhibition.

We assume an active bath, containing solute molecules in metastable states. These molecules may react with $M$ and the transition $J\to K$ occurs through different channels $\alpha$ involving different reactions with the bath. We find that $r=\sum p^\alpha r^\alpha$, where $p^\alpha$ is the probability that channel $\alpha$ occurs, and $r^\alpha$ depends on the amount of heat (more precisely enthalpy) released to the bath in channel $\alpha$.

It has evolved to the cornerstone of spin chemistry, the study of the effect electron and nuclear spins have on chemical reactions, with the avian magnetic compass mechanism and the photosynthetic reaction center dynamics being prominent biophysical manifestations of such effects. In recent years the radical-pair mechanism was shown to be an ideal biological system where the conceptual tools of quantum information science can be fruitfully applied. We will here review recent work making the case that the radical-pair mechanism is indeed a major driving force of the emerging field of quantum biology.
D1-449	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly alter an organism's phenotype. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found across the genome, act as genetic markers, offering insights into the complex web of inheritance. SNPs in specific genes may influence traits, susceptibility to diseases, or even an organism's response to environmental stressors. For instance, a SNP in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene system can influence an individual's immune response to certain viruses, such as HIV. The study of SNPs, therefore, holds immense potential for disease prevention, personalized medicine, and a deeper understanding of evolutionary biology.
D1-450	Spatial stochastic molecular simulations in biology are limited by the intense computation required to track molecules in space either in a discrete time or discrete space framework, meaning that the serial limit has already been reached in sub-cellular models. This calls for parallel simulations that can take advantage of the power of modern supercomputers. however exact methods are known to be inherently serial. We introduce an operator splitting implementation for irregular grids with a novel method to improve accuracy, and demonstrate potential for scalable parallel simulations in an initial MPI version. We foresee that this groundwork will enable larger scale, whole-cell stochastic simulations in the near future.
D1-451	 In the realm of marine biology, the ocean sunfish, also known as mola mola, stands out as an unusual marvel. Weighing up to 2.3 tons and growing to a length of 3 meters, it's one of the heaviest bony fish. What sets it apart, however, is its unique shape and diet - it has a flattened, disc-like body and primarily feeds on jellyfish and small squid. Its large, flappy dorsal and anal fins resemble wings, adding to its unconventional appearance. Interestingly, ocean sunfish are known to leap out of the water, often in response to being startled, providing a spectacle for onlookers.

Here, we report the auspicious performance, through molecular dynamics simulations, of a seawater desalination filter based on the recently-synthesized graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C2N) [Nat. Commun., 2015, 6, 6486]. Taking advantage of the inherent nanopores and excellent mechanical properties of g-C2N filter, highly efficient seawater desalination can be achieved by modulating the nanopores under tensile strain.

Moreover, cyanobacteria's potential as biofactories for producing valuable compounds, such as biofuels and pharmaceuticals, is increasingly being explored, underscoring their immense ecological and economic significance.
D1-456	The importance of collective cellular migration during embryogenesis and tissue repair asks for a sound understanding of underlying principles and mechanisms. Here, we address recent in vitro experiments on cell monolayers which show that the advancement of the leading edge relies on cell proliferation and protrusive activity at the tissue margin. Within a simple viscoelastic mechanical model amenable to detailed analysis, we identify a key parameter responsible for tissue expansion, and we determine the dependence of the monolayer velocity as a function of measurable rheological parameters. Our results allow us to discuss the effects of pharmacological perturbations on the observed tissue dynamics.
D1-457	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent effect serves as a captivating spectacle, yet holds profound significance beyond aesthetics. This phenomenon, found in various organisms like jellyfish, squid, and certain plankton, is a result of a chemical reaction within their bodies. The enzyme luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of light-emitting proteins called luciferases, producing light.

The intricate dance of light in the deep sea not only illuminates our curiosity but also offers valuable insights into the vast, uncharted mysteries of life beneath the waves.
D1-458	Morphological trends in growing colonies of living cells are at the core of physiological and evolutionary processes. Using active gel equations, which include cell division, we show that shape changes during the growth can be regulated by the dynamics of topological defects in the orientation of cells. The friction between the dividing cells and underlying substrate drives anisotropic colony shapes toward more isotropic morphologies, by mediating the number density and velocity of topological defects. We show that the defects interact with the interface at a specific interaction range, set by the vorticity length scale of flows within the colony, and that the cells predominantly reorient parallel to the interface due to division-induced active stresses.
D1-459	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish captivates with its ethereal glow. These gelatinous wonders, found in the deep ocean's twilight zones, produce light through a chemical reaction within their bodies. This light, a mesmerizing dance of blue and green, serves as a camouflage against predators lurking below. The mechanism behind this spectacle involves a luciferin-luciferase reaction, where luciferin is oxidized by luciferase, emitting light as a byproduct.

Specifically, we model the interaction between cells in the proximal tubule of the kidney, free light chains, renal fibroblasts, and myeloma cells. We analyze the model for steady-state solutions to find a mathematically and biologically relevant stable steady-state solution. This foundational model provides a representation of dynamics between key populations in tubulointerstitial fibrosis that demonstrates how these populations interact to affect patient prognosis in patients with MM and renal impairment.

This innovative technique allows for precise editing of DNA sequences, opening doors for potential cures for genetic diseases. By mimicking the bacterial immune system's defense mechanism, scientists can correct mutations, insert or delete specific genes, and even modify the genetic makeup of organisms. This groundbreaking technology holds immense promise, not only for medical applications but also for agriculture and environmental conservation, ushering in a new era of genetic engineering. However, ethical considerations surrounding its use, particularly in human embryos, remain a pressing concern, necessitating thoughtful dialogue and regulation.
D1-462	We present a method of dimensional reduction for the general Markov model of sequence evolution on a phylogenetic tree. We show that taking certain linear combinations of the associated random variables (site pattern counts) reduces the dimensionality of the model from exponential in the number of extant taxa, to quadratic in the number of taxa, while retaining the ability to statistically identify phylogenetic divergence events. A key feature is the identification of an invariant subspace which depends only bilinearly on the model parameters, in contrast to the usual multi-linear dependence in the full space. We discuss potential applications including the computation of split (edge) weights on phylogenetic trees from observed sequence data.
D1-463	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a pivotal player. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence itself, instead modifies how genes are read and expressed. This change can be influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle. For instance, stress, diet, and toxins can induce epigenetic modifications, potentially leading to diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. This field, therefore, opens new avenues for understanding and treating these conditions, offering hope for personalized medicine in the future. Epigenetics, in essence, underscores the profound impact of our lives beyond our genes, shaping the complex interplay of our genetic makeup and health.
D1-464	We combine traction force data with Bayesian inversion to obtain an absolute estimate of the internal stress field of a cell monolayer. The method, Bayesian inversion stress microscopy (BISM), is validated using numerical simulations performed in a wide range of conditions. It is robust to changes in each ingredient of the underlying statistical model. Importantly, its accuracy does not depend on the rheology of the tissue. We apply BISM to experimental traction force data measured in a narrow ring of cohesive epithelial cells, and check that the inferred stress field coincides with that obtained by direct spatial integration of the traction force data in this quasi-one-dimensional geometry.
D1-465	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon exhibited by certain deep-sea creatures is a captivating spectacle. These organisms, such as the anglerfish and comb jelly, produce light through a chemical reaction within their bodies. This light serves multiple purposes, primarily attracting prey and deterring predators in the dark abyss. The mechanism behind this illumination involves luciferin, a light-emitting molecule, and an enzyme called luciferase. When oxygen is introduced, a cascade of reactions occurs, resulting in a flash of light. This mesmerizing display of nature not only showcases the wonders of bioluminescence but also provides insights into the adaptations of life in extreme environments.
D1-466	We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to be separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise. In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.
D1-467	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis, the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. Harnessing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, these organisms produce glucose and oxygen, sustaining their own growth while enriching our atmosphere. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesizers and the environment is crucial, as it underpins the food chain, maintains Earth's oxygen levels, and serves as the primary source of energy for most life forms on our planet.

Also, biological systems achieve remarkable speed, precision and power efficiency using poorly understood physical design principles. Powerful theories like information theory and thermodynamics do not provide general limits on power, precision and speed. Here we go beyond these classical theories to prove that the product of precision and speed is universally bounded by power dissipation in any physical communication channel whose dynamics is faster than that of the signal. Moreover, our derivation involves a novel connection between friction and information geometry. These results may yield insight into both the engineering design of communication devices and the structure and function of biological signaling systems.
D1-469	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, scientifically known as Dinoflagellates, exhibit a captivating display of light. These deep-sea dwellers produce light through a chemical reaction in specialized organs called photophores. The light serves multiple purposes, including camouflage, communication, and luring prey. The light emission is not constant but varies in intensity and color, providing a unique adaptation to the dark abyssal environment. This bioluminescence occurs due to an enzymatic reaction where the enzyme luciferin combines with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, releasing energy in the form of light. This mesmerizing phenomenon offers scientists insights into the mysteries of the deep sea and the remarkable survival strategies of its inhabitants.
D1-470	The influence of hypertension on low-density lipoproteins intake into the arterial wall is an important factor for understanding mechanisms of atherosclerosis. It has been experimentally observed that the increased pressure leads to the higher level of the LDL inside the wall. In this paper we attempt to construct a model of the LDL transport which reproduces quantitatively experimental outcomes. We supplement the well known four-layer arterial wall model to include two pressure induced effects: the compression of the intima tissue and the increase of the fraction of leaky junctions. We demonstrate that such model can reach the very good agreement with experimental data.
D1-471	 In the captivating realm of marine biology, the octopus stands as a fascinating enigma. Known for its intelligent behavior, the octopus possesses an extraordinary ability to change color and texture for camouflage, adapting to its surroundings with uncanny agility. Equipped with three hearts, a highly developed brain, and the capacity to solve complex problems, it showcases a level of cognitive complexity that challenges our understanding of invertebrate intelligence.

However there is a lack of understanding of the types of viral dynamics that can result. Here we present a minimal dynamical model which focuses on the time-dependent interplay between the {\em mobility through} and the {\em occupancy of} such spaces. Our generic model permits analytic analysis while producing a rich diversity of infection profiles in terms of their shapes, durations, and intensities. The general features of these theoretical profiles compare well to real-world data of recent social contagion phenomena.
D1-473	 In the intricate web of life, symbiosis, a close and often long-term biological interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. This harmonious relationship can be mutually beneficial, as in the case of clownfish and sea anemones, or between rhizobia bacteria and leguminous plants, where each party derives nutrients that the other cannot produce. Yet, there exists a form of symbiosis that is less harmonious, such as parasitism, where one organism benefits at the expense of the other, as seen in the relationship between tapeworms and mammals. The study of symbiosis offers valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of life on Earth, highlighting the profound interconnectedness of all living beings.
D1-474	This paper theoretically analyzes a phenomenological stochastic model for bacterial growth. This model comprises cell division and the linear growth of cells, where growth rates and cell cycles are drawn from lognormal distributions. We find that the cell size is expressed as a sum of independent lognormal variables. We show numerically that the quality of the lognormal approximation greatly depends on the distributions of the growth rate and cell cycle. Furthermore, we show that actual parameters of the growth rate and cell cycle take values that give a good lognormal approximation. thus, the experimental cell-size distribution is in good agreement with a lognormal distribution.
D1-475	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert significant influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence can lead to distinct protein structures, altering functions and potentially predisposing an organism to certain traits or diseases. For instance, a particular SNP in the gene associated with cystic fibrosis can cause the production of a faulty protein, leading to the disease's development. On a more optimistic note, understanding these SNPs can pave the way for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, enhancing efficacy and minimizing side effects. Thus, the study of SNPs offers a promising avenue in our quest to comprehend and manipulate the complexities of life at the molecular level.

In this short review we intend to give insights into this topic by discussing some published examples. First, we briefly introduce the different ingredients of a neural dynamical model. Secondly, we introduce some concepts used to describe the dynamic behavior of neural models, namely phase space and its portraits, time series, spectra, multistability and bifurcations. We end with an analysis of the irreversibility of processes and its implications on the functioning of normal and pathological brains.
D1-477	 In the realm of molecular biology, the DNA molecule, a double helix structure, serves as the blueprint for all living organisms. It carries genetic information, encoded in its sequence of nucleotides, which dictates the production of proteins essential for life processes. Meanwhile, proteins, complex chains of amino acids, perform numerous functions within cells, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to building cellular structures. The interplay between DNA and proteins, known as the central dogma of molecular biology, forms the basis of heredity and the development of all living organisms. This intricate dance of DNA and proteins, underpinned by the processes of transcription and translation, is a testament to the complexity and beauty of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-478	We present a generalized Landau-Brazovskii theory for the solidification of chiral molecules on a spherical surface. With increasing sphere radius one encounters first intervals where robust achiral density modulations appear with icosahedral symmetry via first-order transitions. Next, one en- counters intervals where fragile but stable icosahedral structures still can be constructed but only by superposition of multiple irreducible representations. Chiral icoshedral structures appear via continuous or very weakly first-order transitions. Outside these parameter intervals, icosahedral symmetry is broken along a three-fold axis or a five-fold axis. The predictions of the theory are compared with recent numerical simulations.
D1-479	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This biochemical process, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symphony of reactions in chloroplasts, the green powerhouses within cells, sustains life on Earth, serving as the primary source of energy for nearly all organisms. Photosynthesis's efficiency is crucial, as it not only fuels the growth and development of plants but also maintains our atmosphere's oxygen levels, balancing the carbon cycle. In essence, it is the life-giving force that binds the terrestrial world together.
D1-480	Recent efforts to survey the numerous softwares available to perform single molecule tracking (SMT) highlighted a significant dependence of the outcomes on the specific method used, and the limitation encountered by most techniques to capture fast movements in a crowded environment. Other approaches to identify the mode and rapidity of motion of fluorescently labeled biomolecules, that do not relay on the localization and linking of the images of isolated single molecules are, however, available.This direct comparison shows that correlative imaging analysis approaches complement effectively current SMT methods in circumstances when, due to either the density of the sample, the low signal to noise ratio or molecular blinking, trajectory linking does not allow to capture long-range or fast motion.
D1-481	 Invertebrate diversity is staggering, encompassing millions of species that play crucial roles in ecosystems worldwide. From the humble earthworm, a key player in soil health, to the vibrant coral reef-dwelling anemones, these organisms form the base of many food chains. Insects, for instance, contribute significantly to pollination, while cephalopods, such as the octopus, demonstrate remarkable intelligence. Jellyfish, though often misunderstood, exhibit mesmerizing bioluminescence and intricate life cycles. Marine sponges, the oldest multicellular organisms, filter-feed vast quantities of water, maintaining water quality. Invertebrates' adaptability and resilience, despite their simple body structures, are testaments to nature's infinite creativity and the essential roles these tiny creatures play in our world.
D1-482	For many types of learning, spaced training that involves repeated long inter-trial intervals (ITIs) leads to more robust memory formation than does massed training that involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently has data begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced training. We review these theories and data here. Computational models of the implicated signaling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular ITIs can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.
D1-483	 In marine biology, the ocean sunfish (Mola mola) stands out as an intriguing specimen. Known for its enormous size and peculiar appearance, this fish weighs up to 2.3 tons and measures about 3 meters in length. Its unique flattened body, resembling a pancake, is covered in tiny, overlapping, dermal denticles that provide protection against predators. The ocean sunfish exhibits an exceptional diet, feeding mainly on jellyfish and small organisms found in the water column. Its unusual behavior includes leaping out of the water, possibly to dislodge parasites or communicate with others. This fascinating creature continues to captivate scientists and divers alike, offering insights into the remarkable diversity and adaptability found within the ocean's depths.
D1-484	Guided movement in response to slowly diffusing polymeric trails provides a unique mechanism for self-organization of some microorganisms. To elucidate how this signaling route leads to microcolony formation, we experimentally probe the trajectory and orientation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that propel themselves on a surface using type IV pili motility appendages, which preferentially attach to deposited exopolysaccharides. We construct a stochastic model by analyzing single-bacterium trajectories, and show that the resulting theoretical prediction for the many-body behavior of the bacteria is in quantitative agreement with our experimental characterization of how cells explore the surface via a power law strategy.
D1-485	" In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the ""powerhouses of the cell,"" play a pivotal role in energy production. These organelles, enclosed by double membranes, convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. The process, known as cellular respiration, involves a series of complex reactions, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste. Mitochondria's crucial function extends beyond energy production, as they also participate in apoptosis, the programmed cell death that maintains cellular homeostasis. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA, distinct from nuclear DNA, provides essential instructions for the organelle's function and health. Hence, understanding mitochondria's role in cellular metabolism and regulation is fundamental to grasping the intricacies of life at its most fundamental level."
D1-486	We use a three-bead-spring model to investigate the dynamics of bi-flagellate micro-swimmers near a surface. While the primary dynamics and scattering are governed by geometric-dependent direct contact, the fluid flows generated by the swimmer locomotion are important in orienting it toward or away from the surface. Flagellar noise and in particular cell spinning about the main axis help a surface-trapped swimmer escape, whereas the time a swimmer spends at the surface depends on the incident angle. The dynamics results from a nuanced interplay of direct collisions, hydrodynamics, noise and the swimmer geometry. We show that to correctly capture the dynamics of a biflagellate swimmer, minimal models need to resolve the shape asymmetry.
D1-487	 In the fascinating world of biology, photosynthesis serves as a cornerstone, a symphony of life's complexity. Plants, algae, and some bacteria, the verdant backbone of our planet, execute this miraculous process. Utilizing sunlight's energy, they convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a fundamental sugar, and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only sustains life on Earth but also regulates our atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance essential for countless species, including humans. Photosynthesis, hence, is a testament to the intricate dance between organisms and the environment, a dance that has sustained our world for billions of years.
D1-488	Akin to electric circuits, we construct biocircuits that are manipulated by cutting and assembling channels through which stochastic information flows. This diagrammatic manipulation allows us to create a method which constructs networks by joining building blocks selected so that (a) they cover only basic processes. (b) it is scalable to large networks. (c) the mean and variance-covariance from the Pauli master equation form a closed system and. (d) given the initial probability distribution, no special boundary conditions are necessary to solve the master equation. The method aims to help with both designing new synthetic signalling pathways and quantifying naturally existing regulatory networks.
D1-489	 In the intricate world of cellular communication, proteins named ion channels play a pivotal role. They are transmembrane proteins that create passageways for ions to flow across cell membranes. This ion flow, in response to electrical signals, triggers various cellular responses, such as muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and hormone secretions. The gating of ion channels is a complex process, influenced by voltage, ligands, and mechanical forces, which allows cells to react swiftly to changes in their environment. Ion channels, therefore, serve as vital mediators in the intricate orchestra of biological functions.
D1-490	A central challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neural system implements computation through its dynamics. We propose a nonlinear time series model aimed at characterizing interpretable dynamics from neural trajectories. Our model assumes low-dimensional continuous dynamics in a finite volume. It incorporates a prior assumption about globally contractional dynamics to avoid overly enthusiastic extrapolation outside of the support of observed trajectories. We show that our model can recover qualitative features of the phase portrait such as attractors, slow points, and bifurcations, while also producing reliable long-term future predictions in a variety of dynamical models and in real neural data.
D1-491	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the role of photosynthesis cannot be understated. This biochemical process, performed primarily by plants, algae, and some bacteria, is a cornerstone of our planet's life-sustaining system. Through photosynthesis, these organisms convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is essential for the survival of aerobic organisms, including humans. Moreover, the glucose serves as an energy source for the photosynthesizing organisms and other life forms, fueling the web of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, therefore, stands as a testament to the interconnectedness of life on our planet, a testament to the harmony of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, and a testament to the power of life to transform basic elements into complex, vibrant systems.

Practical aspects of sample preparation, handling, data collection, 3D reconstruction, and structure analysis are described. Furthermore, different sample contrasting methods are approached in detail. Examples of microtomographic studies are overviewed to present an outline of biological applications of x-ray microtomography. We also provide perspectives of biological microtomography as the convergence of sciences in x-ray optics, biology, and structural analysis.
D1-493	 Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Azospirillum, play a crucial role in global nutrient cycling. These microorganisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, thereby enriching soil fertility. This process, known as nitrogen fixation, is essential for crop production as it reduces the reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Moreover, these beneficial bacteria establish symbiotic relationships with legumes and grasses, enhancing plant growth and promoting biodiversity. The study of nitrogen-fixing bacteria is an active area of research, with potential applications in sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.
D1-494	Protein binding often involves conformational changes. Important questions are whether a conformational change occurs prior to a binding event ('conformational selection') or after a binding event ('induced fit'), and how conformational transition rates can be obtained from experiments. In this article, we present general results for the chemical relaxation rates of conformational-selection and induced-fit binding processes that hold for all concentrations of proteins and ligands and, thus, go beyond the standard pseudo-first-order approximation of large ligand concentration. These results allow to distinguish conformational-selection from induced-fit processes - also in cases in which such a distinction is not possible under pseudo-first-order conditions - and to extract conformational transition rates of proteins from chemical relaxation data.
D1-495	 In the realm of genetics, DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, serves as the blueprint of life. It's a double-helix structure, intricately wound, carrying the genetic instructions for an organism's development, growth, and function. Each DNA molecule is composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, which pair up in specific ways to form the genetic code. This code, transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins, dictates the biological makeup of an organism, from the smallest bacterium to the most complex human. The study of DNA and its role in inheritance has revolutionized our understanding of life, opening doors to genetic engineering, forensic science, and personalized medicine.
D1-496	The upper motor neuron dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was quantified using triple stimulation and more focal transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques that were developed to reduce recording variability. These measurements were combined with clinical and neurophysiological data to develop a novel random forest based supervised machine learning prediction model. This model was capable of predicting cross-sectional ALS disease severity as measured by the ALSFRSr scale with 97% overall accuracy and 99% precision. The machine learning model developed in this research provides a new, unique and objective diagnostic method for quantifying disease severity and identifying subtle changes in disease progression in ALS.
D1-497	 Embryonic development, a complex and intricate process, is the journey from a single fertilized cell to a fully formed organism. This metamorphosis occurs in three distinct stages: germ layers formation, organ development, and growth. During germ layers formation, the fertilized egg divides and differentiates into three layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which give rise to various tissues and organs. In the organ development stage, these layers further specialize and interact to form the basic body plan, with the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and digestive system emerging. Lastly, in the growth stage, the organs and tissues increase in size and complexity, ready to enter the world as a new life. This remarkable process, a testament to the intricacy of life, underpins our understanding of human development from conception to birth.
D1-498	In this note, we develop semi-analytical techniques to obtain the full correlational structure of a stochastic network of nonlinear neurons described by rate variables. Under the assumption that pairs of membrane potentials are jointly Gaussian -- which they tend to be in large networks -- we obtain deterministic equations for the temporal evolution of the mean firing rates and the noise covariance matrix that can be solved straightforwardly given the network connectivity. We also obtain spike count statistics such as Fano factors and pairwise correlations, assuming doubly-stochastic action potential firing. Importantly, our theory does not require fluctuations to be small, and works for several biologically motivated, convex single-neuron nonlinearities.
D1-499	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of cells, play a crucial role. These organelles convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. Mitochondria have a unique trait: they possess their own DNA, separate from the nucleus. This DNA encodes essential proteins for energy production, showcasing an evolutionary connection to ancient bacteria that were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells, a process known as endosymbiosis. This symbiotic relationship has been instrumental in the development of complex life forms, as mitochondria are indispensable for cellular respiration and survival.
D1-500	Real food web data available in the literature presents us with the relations between various species, sizes of these species, metabolic types of the species and other useful information, which allows us to define parameters for the mathematical dynamical models of these food webs, and perform theoretical studies of these models. Unfortunately, the researches often face the problem of the extinction of the species in such situations, which could be an important limiting factor. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm of parameterisation that leads to the existence of positive steady state and improves persistence of the species in multi-species models of real food webs.
D1-501	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating intersection between genes and environment. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, often influenced by lifestyle factors, can be inherited, shaping an individual's health and development in ways that extend beyond their genetic blueprint. Epigenetics thus offers a compelling perspective on the complex interplay between genes, environment, and health, opening avenues for innovative approaches to disease prevention and treatment.
D1-502	In recent experiments [T. Basta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111, 670 (2014)] lipids and membrane proteins were observed to self-assemble into membrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs) with a well-defined polyhedral protein arrangement and characteristic size. We develop a model of MPPN self-assembly in which the preferred symmetry and size of MPPNs emerge from the interplay of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, topological defects in protein packing, and thermal effects. With all model parameters determined directly from experiments, our model correctly predicts the observed symmetry and size of MPPNs. Our model suggests how key lipid and protein properties can be modified to produce a range of MPPN symmetries and sizes in experiments.

These microscopic organisms, found in the deep ocean's twilight zone, produce a spectral display of blue, green, and yellow light when disturbed. Their light-emitting structures, called plastid-like organelles known as scintillons, are activated by a chemical reaction involving calcium and a protein called green fluorescent protein (GFP). The mesmerizing light show, a product of biological evolution, serves multiple functions including communication, camouflage, and attracting prey, offering a fascinating glimpse into the uncharted depths of our planet's oceans.
D1-504	Alloreactivity following stem cell transplantation (SCT) is difficult to predict in patients undergoing transplantation from HLA matched donors. In this study we performed whole exome sequencing of SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP). This allowed determination of entire library of alloreactive peptide sequences which would bind HLA class I molecules in each DRP. Utilizing the HLA binding affinity (IC50) and tissue expression levels of the parent proteins, an aggregate donor T cell response to the recipient alloreactive peptides was calculated using a vector-operator dynamical system model. Marked variability in the simulated CD8+ T cell responses was observed in all the donor recipient pairs.

This oxygen sustains all aerobic life on Earth, making photosynthesis a cornerstone of our planet's ecosystem. Photosynthesis not only provides energy for organisms but also sequesters carbon dioxide, reducing greenhouse gas levels and contributing to climate regulation. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and life forms a harmonious cycle, highlighting the interconnectedness of all living beings on our planet.
D1-506	Compartments are ubiquitous throughout biology, yet their importance stretches back to the origin of cells. In the context of origin of life, we assume that a protocell, a compartment enclosing functional components, requires $N$ components to be evolvable. We take interest in the timescale in which a minimal evolvable protocell is produced. We show that when protocells fuse and share information, the time to produce an evolvable protocell scales algebraically in $N$, in contrast to an exponential scaling in the absence of fusion. We discuss the implications of this result for origins of life, as well as other biological processes.

D1-508	Using a microfluidic trap, we study the behavior of individual phospholipid vesicles in contact with fatty acids. We show that spontaneous fatty acids insertion inside the bilayer is controlled by the vesicle size, osmotic pressure difference across the membrane and fatty acids concentration in the external bath. Depending on these parameters, vesicles can grow spherically or become unstable and fragment into several daughter vesicles. We establish the phase diagram for vesicle growth and we derive a simple thermodynamic model that reproduces the time evolution of the vesicle volume. Finally, we show that stable growth can be achieved on an artificial cell expressing a simple set of bacterial cytoskeletal proteins, paving the way toward artificial cell reproduction.
D1-509	 Molecular biology delves into the intricate world of life at its most fundamental level, the molecule. It explores DNA, RNA, and proteins, the building blocks of all living organisms. Genes, encoded within DNA, provide the blueprint for protein synthesis, shaping the traits and characteristics of an organism. RNA acts as a messenger, transporting genetic information from DNA to the protein-making machinery of the cell. Proteins, in turn, perform myriad functions, from catalysis in enzymes to structural support in muscles.

D1-510	We investigate the behavior of a model neuron that receives a biophysically-realistic noisy post-synaptic current based on uncorrelated spiking activity from a large number of afferents. We show that, with static synapses, such noise can give rise to inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) as a function of the presynaptic firing rate. We compare this to the case with dynamic synapses that feature short-term synaptic plasticity, and show that the interval of presynaptic firing rate over which ISR exists can be extended or diminished. We consider both short-term depression and facilitation. Interestingly, we find that a double inverse stochastic resonance (DISR), with two distinct wells centered at different presynaptic firing rates, can appear.
D1-511	 In the vast tapestry of life's diversity, the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae, a phenomenon known as coral-algae symbiosis, stands as a testament to nature's intricate balance. Within the coral polyps resides a single-celled alga, Zooxanthellae, which photosynthesizes, providing the coral with essential nutrients. In return, the coral offers the alga a safe haven, sunlight, and waste products. This mutualistic relationship not only sustains the coral but also contributes significantly to marine biodiversity, creating thriving underwater ecosystems teeming with diverse life forms. However, this delicate balance is under threat due to climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution, leading to coral bleaching events and a decline in coral reef health, underscoring the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these vital marine habitats.
D1-512	Catalytic swimmers have attracted much attention as alternatives to biological systems for examining collective microscopic dynamics and the response to physico-chemical signals. Yet, understanding and predicting even the most fundamental characteristics of their individual propulsion still raises important challenges. While chemical asymmetry is widely recognized as the cornerstone of catalytic propulsion, different experimental studies have reported that particles with identical chemical properties may propel in opposite directions. Here, we show that, beyond its chemical properties, the detailed shape of a catalytic swimmer plays an essential role in determining its direction of motion, demonstrating the compatibility of the classical theoretical framework with experimental observations.

These deep-sea dwellers produce light through a chemical reaction within their bodies, leveraging the enzyme luciferin and the protein luciferase. The light emitted serves multiple purposes, including camouflage, communication, and attracting prey. Their glowing tentacles can change color and intensity, providing an impressive spectacle under the ocean's inky darkness. This luminous behavior, a testament to the wonders of nature, continues to fascinate researchers and laypeople alike, offering a glimpse into the mysterious depths of the ocean.
D1-514	We investigate the geometrical and mechanical properties of adherent cells characterized by a highly anisotropic actin cytoskeleton. Using a combination of theoretical work and experiments on micropillar arrays, we demonstrate that the shape of the cell edge is accurately described by elliptical arcs, whose eccentricity expresses the degree of anisotropy of the internal cell stresses. This results in a spatially varying tension along the cell edge, that significantly affects the traction forces exerted by the cell on the substrate. Our work highlights the strong interplay between cell mechanics and geometry and paves the way towards the reconstruction of cellular forces from geometrical data.
D1-515	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study revolves around epigenetics, a science exploring changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of DNA sequence. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence how genes are read and interpreted, affecting traits and behaviors. This dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics sheds light on how experiences, environment, and lifestyle can influence biological development and potentially disease susceptibility, opening avenues for novel therapeutic approaches and a more comprehensive understanding of heredity and health.
D1-516	Advances in time resolved spectroscopy have provided new insight into the energy transmission in natural photosynthetic complexes. Novel theoretical tools and models are being developed in order to explain the experimental results. We provide a model calculation for the two-dimensional electronic spectra of Cholorobaculum tepidum which correctly describes the main features and transfer time scales found in recent experiments. From our calculation one can infer the coupling of the antenna chlorosome with the environment and the coupling between the chlorosome and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. We show that environment assisted transport between the subunits is the required mechanism to reproduce the experimental two-dimensional electronic spectra.
D1-517	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands out as a revolutionary tool. This bacterial defense mechanism, repurposed for genetic engineering, allows precise modifications of DNA sequences. By harnessing this system, scientists can edit, correct, or even replace specific genes in a wide array of organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals, including humans. This groundbreaking technology offers promising potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even eradicating harmful pathogens. However, ethical implications and potential risks, such as unintended off-target effects, necessitate careful consideration and rigorous research to ensure its safe and responsible application.
D1-518	The brain forms and stores distributed representations from sparse external input that compete for neuronal resources with already stored memory traces. It is unclear what dynamical properties of neural systems allow formation and subsequent consolidation of new, distributed memory representations under these conditions. Here we use analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to show that a dynamical regime near a phase-transition in neuronal network activity (i.e. criticality) may play an important role in this process. Our results reveal that near-critical dynamics are necessary to stabilize and store new sparsely driven representations when they compete with native network states.
D1-519	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the phytoplankton, microscopic marine plants, play a pivotal role. These tiny organisms float at the ocean's surface, photosynthesizing during daylight hours, converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, thereby contributing significantly to our planet's breathable atmosphere. Additionally, phytoplankton serve as a vital food source for a multitude of aquatic creatures, anchoring the ocean's food web. Their delicate balance is essential for maintaining marine biodiversity. However, their resilience is being tested by climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution, potentially disrupting this vital ecosystem and ultimately, our own.
D1-520	We discuss the gauge field theory approach to protein structure study, which allows a natural way to introduce collective degrees of freedom and nonlinear topological structures. Local symmetry of proteins and its breaking in the medium is considered, what allows to derive Abelian Higgs model of protein backbone, correct folding of which is defined by gauge symmetry breaking due hydrophobic forces. Within this model structure of protein backbone is defined by superposition of one-dimensional topological solitons (kinks), what allows to reproduce the three-dimensional structure of the protein backbone with precision up to 1A and to predict its dynamics.
D1-521	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds, a process that underpins every biological lifeform. This dance begins with the unwinding of the DNA double helix, facilitated by enzymes, followed by the creation of RNA copies called transcripts. These transcripts then act as blueprints for protein synthesis, a process that involves the assembly line-like production of proteins, which are crucial for cell structure and function. The cyclic nature of DNA replication ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, maintaining the marvelous diversity and resilience of life.
D1-522	In living cells, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and connect to one another by sharing substrates and products, forming complex networks. In our previous studies, we established a framework determining the responses to enzyme perturbations only from network topology, and then proved a theorem, called the law of localization, explaining response patterns in terms of network topology. In this paper, we generalize these results to reaction networks with conserved concentrations, which allows us to study any reaction systems. We also propose novel network characteristics quantifying robustness. We compare E. coli metabolic network with randomly rewired networks, and find that the robustness of the E. coli network is significantly higher than that of the random networks.
D1-523	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert profound influences. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found across populations, can subtly alter protein structure and function, impacting traits from eye color to susceptibility to disease. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while the Factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a predisposition towards blood clots. These SNPs, while seemingly insignificant, can dramatically alter an individual's health trajectory, underscoring the power of our genetic makeup in shaping our biology.
D1-524	Here we report a method for visualization of volumetric structural information of live biological samples with no exogenous contrast agents. The process is made possible through a technique that involves generation, synthesis and analysis of three-dimensional (3D) Fourier components of light diffracted by the sample. This leads to the direct recovery of quantitative cellular morphology with no iterative procedures for reduced computational complexity. Combing with the fact that the technique is easily adaptive to any imaging platform and requires minimum sample preparation, our proposed method is particularly promising for observing fast, volumetric and dynamic events previously only accessible through staining methods.
D1-525	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system represents a groundbreaking tool for gene editing. This innovative technology, derived from bacterial immune systems, allows for precise modification of DNA sequences. By harnessing guide RNA molecules and the Cas9 enzyme, researchers can easily and efficiently target specific genes, opening doors for potential therapies and scientific discoveries. The implications of CRISPR-Cas9 span across various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and basic biology research, revolutionizing the way we manipulate and understand genetic information. This powerful technique, however, also raises ethical questions and calls for careful consideration, as it potentially brings us closer to altering the very essence of life.
D1-526	The present study reports interesting findings in regard to emotional arousal based activities while listening to two Hindustani classical ragas of contrast emotion. EEG data was taken on 5 naive listeners while they listened to two ragas Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray contrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non linear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the two methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results compared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of biosignal data. The results and implications have been discussed in detail.
D1-527	 In the intricate dance of cellular processes, protein synthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical pathway, occurring within the ribosomes, transforms genetic information into protein structure. The process commences with transcription, where DNA is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). Subsequently, the mRNA migrates to the cytoplasm, where it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome deciphers the mRNA sequence, pairing each codon with its corresponding amino acid. With the aid of transfer RNA (tRNA), this amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain. This continuous assembly, facilitated by the ribosome's movement along the mRNA, culminates in the synthesis of a functional protein, an essential component in maintaining the cell's structure and function.
D1-528	High throughput immune repertoire sequencing is promising to lead to new statistical diagnostic tools for medicine and biology. Successful implementations of these methods require a correct characterization, analysis and interpretation of these datasets. We present IGoR -- a new comprehensive tool that takes B or T-cell receptors sequence reads and quantitatively characterizes the statistics of receptor generation from both cDNA and gDNA. It probabilistically annotates sequences and its modular structure can investigate models of increasing biological complexity for different organisms. For B-cells IGoR returns the hypermutation statistics, which we use to reveal co-localization of hypermutations along the sequence. We demonstrate that IGoR outperforms existing tools in accuracy and estimate the sample sizes needed for reliable repertoire characterization.
D1-529	 Nitrogen fixation is a vital biological process essential for life, as it converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into a usable form, ammonia (NH3). This transformation occurs through a specialized enzyme called nitrogenase, found in certain bacteria like Rhizobium and Azotobacter. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria form symbiotic relationships with plants, such as legumes, to enhance their nitrogen supply. The nitrogen-fixing process is energy-intensive, requiring a significant amount of ATP, and is often triggered by reduced environmental conditions, like low oxygen levels or limited nitrogen availability. The importance of nitrogen fixation lies in its role in nutrient cycling, ensuring the availability of nitrogen for plants, which ultimately sustains a wide array of ecosystems and agricultural productivity.
D1-530	We investigate the dynamics of the heterodimer autorepression loop (HAL), a small genetic module in which a protein A acts as an auto-repressor and binds to a second protein B to form a AB dimer. For suitable values of the rate constants the HAL produces pulses of A alternating with pulses of B. By means of analytical and numerical calculations, we show that the duration of A-pulses is extremely robust against variation of the rate constants while the duration of the B-pulses can be flexibly adjusted. The HAL is thus a minimal genetic module generating robust pulses with tunable duration an interesting property for cellular signalling.
D1-531	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiotic relationships serve as a testament to nature's remarkable adaptability. One such example is the mutualism between coral polyps and algae, zooxanthellae. Corals provide algae with a protected environment and nutrients, while the algae, in turn, photosynthesize and produce oxygen and sugars, providing energy for the coral. This partnership allows coral reefs to thrive in sunlight-drenched, nutrient-poor oceanic environments, offering a vibrant, diverse ecosystem teeming with life. Yet, this delicate balance is under threat due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing, jeopardizing the survival of these captivating underwater metropolises.
D1-532	"The ""Kill the Winner"" hypothesis is an attempt to address the problem of diversity in biology. It argues that host-specific predators control the population of each prey, preventing a winner from emerging and thus maintaining the coexistence of all species in the system. We develop a stochastic model for the ""Kill the Winner"" paradigm and show that the stable coexistence state of the deterministic ""Kill the Winner"" model is destroyed by demographic stochasticity, through a cascade of extinction events. We formulate an individual-level stochastic model in which predator-prey coevolution promotes high diversity of the ecosystem by generating a persistent population flux of species."
D1-533	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea squirt, a cephalodochiate tunicate, assumes a peculiar role. During its larval stage, it roams the ocean currents, but upon maturity, it anchors itself to a substrate, transforming its internal organs into a stationary structure. This conversion, known as metamorphosis, reorients its digestive system to face the water, effectively turning it into a sessile feeding organ. By filtering seawater for food particles, the sea squirt serves as a crucial link in the food chain, providing sustenance for a myriad of marine species. Its seemingly passive existence belies its profound impact on marine biodiversity.
D1-534	Disease, opinions, ideas, gossip, etc. all spread on social networks. How these networks are connected (the network structure) influences the dynamics of the spreading processes. By investigating these relationships one gains understanding both of the spreading itself and the structure and function of the contact network. In this chapter, we will summarize the recent literature using simulation of spreading processes on top of empirical contact data. We will mostly focus on disease simulations on temporal proximity networks -- networks recording who is close to whom, at what time -- but also cover other types of networks and spreading processes. We analyze 29 empirical networks to illustrate the methods.
D1-535	 In the intricate world of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role. These double-membrane bound organelles are responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell, through a process called cellular respiration. This process involves breaking down glucose, a simple sugar, into carbon dioxide and water, while releasing energy that is stored in ATP. Besides their energy-producing role, mitochondria are also key players in several other cellular processes, including programmed cell death and the regulation of cellular calcium levels. These dynamic organelles have an independent genome, distinct from the nucleus, and their evolution is thought to have begun as free-living bacteria that were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells over a billion years ago.
D1-536	The brain can be understood as a collection of interacting neuronal oscillators, but the extent to which its sustained activity is due to coupling among brain areas is still unclear. Here we study the joint dynamics of two cortical columns described by Jansen-Rit neural mass models, and show that coupling between the columns gives rise to stochastic initiations of sustained collective activity, which can be interpreted as epileptic events. For large enough coupling strengths, termination of these events results mainly from the emergence of synchronization between the columns, and thus is controlled by coupling instead of noise. Stochastic triggering and noise-independent durations are characteristic of excitable dynamics, and thus we interpret our results in terms of collective excitability.
D1-537	 In marine ecosystems, the distasteful Blue-ringed Octopus (Hapalochlaena spp.) thrives, camouflaging itself among rocks and corals. Its vibrant blue rings, a warning signal, reveal only when threatened. This miniature predator, barely 30 centimeters long, delivers a highly potent venom through its bite, making it one of the world's most deadly invertebrates. The venom disrupts nerve impulses, causing paralysis and eventually death in minutes. Despite its lethality, the blue-ringed octopus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance within its underwater habitat, controlling populations of small prey. Its intricate dance of life and death underscores the delicate balance and complex interplay between species in the ocean's depths.
D1-538	Many simple RNA viruses enclose their genetic material by a protein shell called the capsid. While the capsid structures are well characterized for most viruses, the structure of RNA inside the shells and the factors contributing to it remain poorly understood. We study the impact of base pairing on the conformations of RNA and find that it undergoes a swollen coil to globule continuous transition as a function of the strength of the pairing interaction. We also observe a first order transition and kink profile as a function of RNA length. All these transitions could explain the different RNA profiles observed inside viral shells.
D1-539	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing, providing a precise and efficient tool to manipulate DNA. Originally derived from bacteria as a defense mechanism against viral infections, the system comprises short RNA sequences and enzymes that can be programmed to target specific genes. This technology holds immense potential, from correcting genetic mutations responsible for diseases like cystic fibrosis to enhancing crop resistance against pests. However, the ethical implications of altering the human genome remain a contentious issue, sparking debates about the boundaries of genetic modification. As research progresses, it's crucial to navigate these ethical dilemmas responsibly, ensuring the benefits of this groundbreaking technology are harnessed for the greater good while minimizing potential risks.
D1-540	In this paper we study some deterministic mathematical models that seek to explain the expansion of zika virus, as a viral epidemic, using published data for Brazil. SIR type models are proposed and validated using the epidemic data found, considering several aspects in the spread of the disease. Finally, we confirmed that the crucial epidemic parameter such as $R_0$ is consistent with those previously reported in the literature for other areas. We also explored variations of the parameters within Brazil for different federal entities. We concluded that a parsimonious model that includes both human and vector populations best describe the epidemic parameters.
D1-541	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton is pivotal. These microscopic photosynthesizers float at the ocean's surface, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into energy. This process, known as primary production, forms the base of the marine food web. Phytoplankton support countless aquatic species, from microscopic zooplankton to filter-feeding whales. Their productivity is vital for maintaining oceanic health, providing 50% of the planet's oxygen and absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide. However, changes in water temperature, nutrient levels, and ocean currents can disrupt phytoplankton blooms, leading to imbalances in marine food webs and potentially contributing to climate change.
D1-542	"Single-cell gene expression is inherently stochastic. its emergent behavior can be defined in terms of the chemical master equation describing the evolution of the mRNA and protein copy numbers as the latter tends to infinity. We establish two types of ""macroscopic limits"": the Kurtz limit is consistent with the classical chemical kinetics, while the L\'{e}vy limit provides a theoretical foundation for an empirical equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97:168302, 2006]. Furthermore, we clarify the biochemical implications and ranges of applicability for various macroscopic limits and calculate a comprehensive analytic expression for the protein concentration distribution in autoregulatory gene networks. The relationship between our work and modern population genetics is discussed."
D1-543	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. Through the green pigment chlorophyll, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air and water from the soil, producing glucose and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This essential process not only sustains the lives of these organisms but also forms the basis of food chains and the oxygen we breathe, making it a vital cog in Earth's life-support system.
D1-544	Traveling waves describe diverse natural phenomena from crystal growth in physics to range expansions in biology. Two classes of waves exist with very different properties: pulled and pushed. Pulled waves are driven by high growth rates at the expansion edge, where the number of organisms is small and fluctuations are large. In contrast, fluctuations are suppressed in pushed waves because the region of maximal growth is shifted towards the population bulk. Although it is commonly believed that expansions are either pulled or pushed, we found an intermediate class of waves with bulk-driven growth, but exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.
D1-545	 Nitrogen fixation, a vital biological process, transforms atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. This transformation is primarily mediated by symbiotic bacteria such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, which form nodules on the roots of legumes. These bacteria contain nitrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes nitrogen fixation while consuming large amounts of ATP and reducing equivalents. The fixed nitrogen is then assimilated by the legume host and other surrounding plants, reducing the need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers. This mutualistic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria contributes significantly to soil fertility and global nitrogen cycling.
D1-546	A numerical method using implicit surface representations is proposed to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equations that arise in mathematical models for the electrostatics of molecules in solvent. The proposed method used an implicit boundary integral formulation to derived a linear system defined on Cartesian nodes in a narrowband surrounding the closed surface that separate the molecule and the solvent. The needed implicit surfaces is constructed from the given atomic description of the molecules, by a sequence of standard level set algorithms. A fast multipole method is applied to accelerate the solution of the linear system. A few numerical studies involving some standard test cases are presented and compared to other existing results.
D1-547	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the study of DNA sequences reveals a wealth of information about an organism's traits and characteristics. The genetic code, a complex language composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - serves as the blueprint for life. Each organism's unique DNA sequence, encoded within its chromosomes, determines its physical attributes, behavioral tendencies, and susceptibility to certain diseases. This fascinating field of biology continues to unravel the mysteries of life, offering potential solutions to health issues, driving advancements in agriculture, and fueling groundbreaking research in evolution and species diversity.
D1-548	Deterministic evolutionary game dynamics can lead to stable coexistences of different types. Stochasticity, however, drives the loss of such coexistences. This extinction is usually accompanied by population size fluctuations. We investigate the most probable extinction trajectory under such fluctuations by mapping a stochastic evolutionary model to a problem of classical mechanics using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Our results show that more abundant types in a coexistence can be more likely to go extinct first well agreed with previous results, and also the distance between the coexistence and extinction point is not a good predictor of extinction. Instead, the WKB method correctly predicts the type going extinct first.
D1-549	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid is a captivating enigma. These cephalopods, native to the deep sea, produce a mesmerizing glow, primarily due to a chemical reaction within specialized cells called photophores. This light serves various purposes, from attracting prey to camouflaging against predators. Interestingly, the squid's light can change color and intensity, suggesting a high level of control and adaptability in their light-producing abilities. This intricate dance of light in the dark abyss not only illuminates our understanding of these creatures but also expands the boundaries of bioluminescence research, potentially leading to innovative applications in fields such as medicine and technology.
D1-550	To survive starvation, Bacillus subtilis forms durable spores. After asymmetric cell division, the septum grows around the forespore in a process called engulfment, but the mechanism of force generation is unknown. Here, we derived a novel biophysical model for the dynamics of cell-wall remodeling during engulfment based on a balancing of dissipative, active, and mechanical forces. By plotting phase diagrams, we predict that sporulation is promoted by a line tension from the attachment of the septum to the outer cell wall, as well as by an imbalance in turgor pressures in the mother-cell and forespore compartments. We also predict that significant mother-cell growth hinders engulfment. Hence, relatively simple physical principles may guide this complex biological process.
D1-551	 In the intricate world of genetics, the study of DNA's role in heredity and evolution, a fascinating phenomenon arises: epigenetics. This field delves into the modifications that alter gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily through methylation and acetylation of histones, play a crucial role in gene regulation. Epigenetic alterations can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment offers a captivating perspective on how our lives, behaviors, and health can be influenced beyond our genetic blueprint.
D1-552	We propose a mean-field model of intermittent particle transport, where a particle may be in one of two phases: the first is an active (ballistic) phase, when a particle runs with constant velocity in some direction, and the second is a passive (diffusive) phase, when the particle diffuses freely. The particle can instantly change the phase of motion. When the particle is in the active phase the rate of transition to the passive phase depends, in general, on time from the beginning of the run, so the distribution of the free path is not exponential. When the particle is in the passive phase the transition rate is constant, and diffusion is non-anomalous Brownian.
D1-553	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This biochemical process, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This vital exchange sustains Earth's diverse ecosystems, providing oxygen for respiration and energy in the form of glucose. Photosynthesis' efficiency, however, is threatened by rising CO2 levels and climate change, potentially altering the delicate balance of our planet's life support system. Understanding and optimizing photosynthesis could thus offer a potent solution to mitigate climate change and ensure the survival of future generations.
D1-554	The real part of the refractive index (RI) of aqueous solutions of human hemoglobin is computed from their absorption spectra in the wavelength range $250\,{\rm nm} - 1100\,{\rm nm}$ using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations and the corresponding uncertainty analysis is provided. The strong ultraviolet (UV) and infrared absorbance of the water outside this spectral range were taken into account in a previous study employing KK relations. We improve these results by including the concentration dependence of the water absorbance as well as by modeling the deep UV absorbance of hemoglobin's peptide backbone. The two free parameters of the model for the deep UV absorbance are fixed by a global fit.
D1-555	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. This biochemical process, performed primarily by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, while oxygen is a byproduct, making photosynthesis an essential contributor to our atmosphere's oxygen levels. This symbiotic relationship between plants and photosynthesis sustains virtually all life on Earth, serving as a testament to nature's ingenious solutions for survival.
D1-556	The spread of an infectious disease is known to change people's behavior, which in turn affects the spread of disease. Adaptive network models that account for both epidemic and behavior change have found oscillations, but in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space, which contrasts with intuition and available data. In this paper we propose a simple SIS epidemic model on an adaptive network with time-delayed rewiring, and show that oscillatory solutions are now present in a wide region of the parameter space. Altering the transmission or rewiring rates reveals the presence of an endemic bubble - an enclosed region of the parameter space where oscillations are observed.
D1-557	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a mesmerizing spectacle, illuminating the deep sea's inky darkness. Certain marine creatures, such as the anglerfish and comb jelly, produce this eerie glow, often through a chemical reaction involving a luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. Light production occurs when oxygen interacts with these compounds, producing energy that emits light. This unique ability serves various purposes, including attracting prey, warding off predators, and communication among species. The study of bioluminescence offers valuable insights into the intricate workings of life and deepens our understanding of the ocean's enchanting mysteries.
D1-558	Anatomical studies demonstrate that brain reformats input information to generate reliable responses for performing computations. However, it remains unclear how neural circuits encode complex spatio-temporal patterns. We show that neural dynamics are strongly influenced by the phase alignment between the input and the spontaneous chaotic activity. Input structuring along the dominant chaotic projections causes the chaotic trajectories to become stable channels (or attractors), hence, improving the computational capability of a recurrent network. Using mean field analysis, we derive the impact of input structuring on the overall stability of attractors formed. Our results indicate that input alignment determines the extent of intrinsic noise suppression and hence, alters the attractor state stability, thereby controlling the network's inference ability.
D1-559	 In the realm of genetics, epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between gene expression and environment. Unlike DNA sequencing, epigenetics doesn't alter the genetic code itself but rather alters how genes are read and interpreted. This is achieved through chemical modifications like methylation and acetylation, which can either activate or suppress gene activity. These changes can occur due to various factors such as age, lifestyle, and even external stimuli. Epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in development, disease susceptibility, and response to treatments, opening new avenues for personalized medicine and therapeutic strategies. The dynamic nature of epigenetics underscores the intricate interplay between our genes and the world around us.
D1-560	We study the behavior of five proteins at the air-water and oil-water interfaces by all-atom molecular dynamics. The proteins are found to get distorted when pinned to the interface. This behavior is consistent with the phenomenological way of introducing the interfaces in a coarse-grained model through a force that depends on the hydropathy indices of the residues. Proteins couple to the oil-water interface stronger than to the air- water one. They diffuse slower at the oil-water interface but do not depin from it, whereas depinning events are observed at the other interface. The reduction of the disulfide bonds slows the diffusion down.
D1-561	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant breakthrough. Epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequencing, alters gene expression without changing the actual DNA code. This phenomenon is influenced by various factors such as age, environment, behavior, and disease states. For instance, stress can lead to methylation, a common epigenetic modification, which in turn affects gene expression. Epigenetics offers a fascinating perspective on how our lives, experiences, and even our choices may shape our genetic behavior, ultimately bridging the gap between nature and nurture.
D1-562	Recent work indicates that twist-bend coupling plays an important role in DNA micromechanics. Here we investigate its effect on bent DNA. We provide an analytical solution of the minimum-energy shape of circular DNA, showing that twist-bend coupling induces sinusoidal twist waves. This solution is in excellent agreement with both coarse-grained simulations of minicircles and nucleosomal DNA data, which is bent and wrapped around histone proteins in a superhelical conformation. Our analysis shows that the observed twist oscillation in nucleosomal DNA, so far attributed to the interaction with the histone proteins, is an intrinsic feature of free bent DNA, and should be observable in other protein-DNA complexes.
D1-563	 In the complex realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the lifeblood of our planet. It's the dance between green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This intricate process occurs in the chloroplasts, the organelles that resemble tiny solar panels. Photosynthesis is not only essential for the survival of these organisms but also for virtually all life on Earth, as it forms the base of the food chain. It's a delicate yet powerful balance, a testament to the wonders of nature and its intricate, interwoven systems.
D1-564	Applying the method of moments to the chemical master equation (CME) appearing in stochastic chemical kinetics often leads to the so-called closure problem. Recently, several authors showed that this problem can be partially overcome using moment-based semidefinite programs (SDPs). In particular, they showed that moment-based SDPs can be used to calculate rigorous bounds on various descriptions of the stochastic chemical kinetic system's stationary distribution(s) -- for example, mean molecular counts, variances in these counts, and so on. In this paper, we show that these ideas can be extended to the corresponding dynamic problem, calculating time-varying bounds on the same descriptions.
D1-565	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the tandem duplication of genes plays a significant role in evolutionary adaptation. This process involves the replication of a gene segment, followed by its immediate repetition, creating an identical pair. Tandem duplications can lead to the production of novel proteins, enhance gene family diversity, and facilitate functional redundancy or neofunctionalization. These genetic alterations are instrumental in species development and survival, as they provide a flexible genetic framework capable of rapid response to environmental pressures and stimuli. The study of tandem duplications offers valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underpinning evolutionary change, shedding light on the intricate dance of nature and genetics.
D1-566	A function f is said to possess superoscillations if, in a finite region, f oscillates faster than the shortest wavelength that occurs in the Fourier transform of f. I will discuss four aspects of superoscillations: 1. Superoscillations can be generated efficiently and stably through multiplication. 2. There is a win-win situation in the sense that even in circumstances where superoscillations cannot be used for superresolution, they can be useful for what may be called superabsorption, an effective up-conversion of low frequencies 3. The study of superoscillations may be useful for generalizing the Shannon Hartley noisy channel capacity theorem. 4. The phenomenon of superoscillations naturally generalizes beyond bandlimited functions.
D1-567	 In marine biology, the delicate balance of life thrives in the coral reef ecosystem. These vibrant underwater landscapes, teeming with diverse species, are often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea.' Corals, the foundation of this biodiversity hotspot, are actually tiny animals, not plants. They secrete a hard, protective calcium carbonate structure, providing shelter for countless marine organisms. However, these reefs face significant threats: climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices jeopardize their existence. The loss of coral reefs would not only deprive us of their breathtaking beauty but also disrupt the livelihoods of millions who depend on them for food and income. Conservation efforts, from protected marine areas to sustainable fishing practices, are crucial to preserve these vital ecosystems for future generations.
D1-568	Measuring the average refractive index (RI) of spherical objects, such as suspended cells, in quantitative phase imaging (QPI) requires a decoupling of RI and size from the QPI data. This has been commonly achieved by determining the object's radius with geometrical approaches, neglecting light-scattering. Here, we present a novel QPI fitting algorithm that reliably uncouples the RI using Mie theory and a semi-analytical, corrected Rytov approach. We assess the range of validity of this algorithm in silico and experimentally investigate various objects (oil and protein droplets, microgel beads, cells) and noise conditions. In addition, we provide important practical cues for future studies in cell biology.
D1-569	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucial role. These stationary, tentacled creatures, often found on coral reefs, are vital to the balance of their environment. They feed on small organisms, including plankton and fish, using their stinging cells for defense and capture. However, they also serve as hosts to various symbiotic organisms, such as clownfish, which find protection within their structures. In turn, the fish help control numbers of harmful organisms around the anemone. This intricate relationship underscores the interconnectedness of life in our oceans, where every organism plays a significant role in maintaining the delicate balance of the ecosystem.
D1-570	We introduce a stochastic model of coupled genetic oscillators in which chains of chemical events involved in gene regulation and expression are represented as sequences of Poisson processes. We characterize steady states by their frequency, their quality factor and their synchrony by the oscillator cross correlation. The steady state is determined by coupling and exhibits stochastic transitions between different modes. The interplay of stochasticity and nonlinearity leads to isolated regions in parameter space in which the coupled system works best as a biological pacemaker. Key features of the stochastic oscillations can be captured by an effective model for phase oscillators that are coupled by signals with distributed delays.
D1-571	 In the realm of genetic research, CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized biology. This revolutionary tool allows precise editing of DNA sequences, enabling scientists to correct genetic defects, eradicate disease-causing pathogens, and even enhance crop yields. By targeting specific gene sequences and cutting, copying, or modifying them, CRISPR offers a promising solution to various genetic disorders. Furthermore, its application in agriculture holds immense potential, potentially eliminating the need for chemical pesticides and genetically modifying crops to withstand harsh conditions, thereby ensuring food security in the face of climate change. This groundbreaking technology promises to reshape the future of medicine and agriculture, offering hope for a healthier, more sustainable world.
D1-572	An algorithm based on PLS regression has been developed and optimized for measuring blood glucose level using the infra-red transmission spectrum of blood samples. A set of blood samples were tagged with their glucose concentration using an accurate invasive glucometer and analyzed using a standard FTIR spectrometer. Using the developed algorithm, the results of the FTIR spectroscopy of the samples were analyzed to find the glucose concentration in the samples. The obtained glucose concentration by the algorithm were in good agreement with the results obtained by the standard glucometer, and the mean estimation error was 7 mg/dL. This error is in the range of available commercial invasive meters.
D1-573	 Embracing the fascinating realm of genetics, we delve into the intricate world of DNA replication. This biological process, akin to a meticulous photocopier, ensures the faithful transfer of genetic information from one generation of cells to the next. The double helix unwinds, exposing its base pairs, as enzymes diligently create new strands, mirroring the original. This dance of molecular interplay not only preserves our unique genetic identity but also fuels cell division, sustaining life's incredible diversity and resilience.
D1-574	The Gemini theorem asserts that, given certain reasonable assumptions, no physical system can be certainly aware of its own existence. The theorem can be proved algorithmically, but the proof of this theorem is somewhat obscure, and there exists very little literature on it. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief non-technical summary of the theorem and its proof, with a view to stimulating critical discussion of the proof and its implications. Since the theorem implies that a violation of the conservation of energy will take place within the brains of conscious human beings, it has obvious implications for any physical theory.
D1-575	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single gene mutation can have profound effects on an organism. For instance, the cystic fibrosis gene carries such a mutation, causing production of a faulty protein that disrupts the movement of salt and water in and out of cells, leading to thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. This accumulation of mucus can result in persistent lung infections and eventually, respiratory failure. However, the human body's remarkable resilience often manifests in the form of genetic diversity, offering hope for those affected by such conditions. Research continues to unravel the mysteries of DNA, seeking answers to modify or replace problematic genes, providing potential cures and improving the quality of life for countless individuals.
D1-576	"The production of mechanical stresses in living organisms largely relies on localized, force-generating active units embedded in filamentous matrices. Numerical simulations of discrete fiber networks with fixed boundaries have shown that buckling in the matrix dramatically amplifies the resulting active stresses. Here we extend this result to a bucklable continuum elastic medium subjected to an arbitrary external stress, and derive analytical expressions for the active, nonlinear constitutive relations characterizing the full active medium. Inserting these relations into popular ""active gel"" descriptions of living tissues and the cytoskeleton will enable investigations into nonlinear regimes previously inaccessible due to the phenomenological nature of these theories."
D1-577	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating concept emerges: epigenetics. Unlike DNA sequence alterations, epigenetics revolves around changes in gene expression that do not involve modifications to the underlying DNA. Instead, it encompasses chemical tags on DNA and histones, those structural proteins that package DNA, allowing genes to be turned on or off. Environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and toxins, can influence these chemical tags, resulting in altered gene expression and, potentially, changes in cell behavior. This dynamic interplay between genetics and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and opens avenues for understanding and addressing a host of conditions, ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases.
D1-578	Inferring directional couplings from the spike data of networks is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience. Here, we apply a recently proposed objective procedure to the spike data obtained from the Hodgkin--Huxley type models and in vitro neuronal networks cultured in a circular structure. As a result, we succeed in reconstructing synaptic connections accurately from the evoked activity as well as the spontaneous one. To obtain the results, we invent an analytic formula approximately implementing a method of screening relevant couplings. This significantly reduces the computational cost of the screening method employed in the proposed objective procedure, making it possible to treat large-size systems as in this study.
D1-579	 In the realm of genomics, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing, offering a precise and efficient method to manipulate DNA sequences. This groundbreaking technology, derived from bacterial immunity mechanisms, allows scientists to correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and study gene functions with unprecedented accuracy. Its potential applications span from fundamental research to medicine, agriculture, and industry, promising a future where inherited diseases could be eradicated, crops could be engineered for sustainability, and even extinct species could be resurrected through de-extinction programs. As we delve deeper into this genetic frontier, the ethical, legal, and social implications demand careful consideration to ensure the responsible and equitable use of this powerful tool.
D1-580	We observe and study a self-organized phenomenon whereby the activity in a network of spiking neurons spontaneously terminates. We consider different types of populations, consisting of bistable model neurons connected electrically by gap junctions, or by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, in a scale-free connection topology. We find that strongly synchronized population spiking events lead to complete cessation of activity in excitatory networks, but not in gap junction or inhibitory networks. We identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon by examining the particular shape of the excitatory postsynaptic currents that arise in the neurons. We also examine the effects of the synaptic time constant, coupling strength, and channel noise on the occurrence of the phenomenon.
D1-581	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish captivates our imaginations. These ethereal creatures emit soft, pulsating lights, creating a mesmerizing display beneath the ocean's surface. The source of this luminescence lies within their specialized cells, called photophores. These cells contain a chemical reaction that produces light, harnessing the energy from a chemical called luciferin and an enzyme named luciferase. This unique trait serves various purposes, from attracting prey to deterring predators, adding another layer of wonder to the vast, mysterious depths of the ocean.
D1-582	The emerging field at the intersection of quantitative biology, network modeling, and control theory has enjoyed significant progress in recent years. This Special Issue brings together a selection of papers on complementary approaches to observe, identify, and control biological and biologically inspired networks. These approaches advance the state of the art in the field by addressing challenges common to many such networks, including high dimensionality, strong nonlinearity, uncertainty, and limited opportunities for observation and intervention. Because these challenges are not unique to biological systems, it is expected that many of the results presented in these contributions will also find applications in other domains, including physical, social, and technological networks.
D1-583	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, the protein kinase C (PKC) family plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling. Activated by diverse stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters, PKC phosphorylates specific proteins, modulating a wide range of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The PKC family, comprising at least ten isoforms, exhibits complex subcellular localization and regulatory mechanisms, adding another layer of complexity to its role in cellular signaling cascades. Understanding the precise functions and regulation of PKC isozymes is crucial for elucidating their potential as therapeutic targets in various diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders.
D1-584	Simplest extensions of single particle dynamics in momentum conserving active fluid - that of an active suspension of two colloidal particles or a single particle confined by a wall - exhibit strong departures from Boltzmann behavior, resulting in either a breakdown of an effective temperature description or a steady state with nonzero entropy production rate. This is a consequence of hydrodynamic interactions that introduce multiplicative noise in the stochastic description of the particle positions. This results in fluctuation induced interactions that depend on distance as a power law. We find that the dynamics of activated colloids in a passive fluid, with stochastic forcing localized on the particle, is different from that of passive colloids in an active fluctuating fluid.
D1-585	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of alleles plays a pivotal role. Alleles are alternate forms of a gene that may occur at the same locus on homologous chromosomes. They dictate the variations we witness within species, influencing traits such as eye color, blood type, and even susceptibility to certain diseases. During the process of meiosis, parental chromosomes segregate and recombine, resulting in offspring with unique combinations of alleles. This genetic diversity, fostered by the shuffling of alleles, enhances species adaptability and survival. It's a testament to nature's intricate design, where small variations can lead to profound changes, ensuring the continuity and evolution of life.
D1-586	The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal vaccine sharing between two SIR centers in the presence of migration fluxes of susceptibles and infected individuals during the mumps outbreak. Optimality of the vaccine allocation means the minimization of the total number of lost working days during the whole period of epidemic outbreak $[0,t_f]$, which can be described by the functional $Q=\int_0^{t_f}I(t){\rm d}t$ where $I(t)$ stands for the number of infectives at time $t$. We explain the behavior of the optimal allocation, which depends on the model parameters and the amount of available vaccine.
D1-587	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential biological process, is primarily accomplished by symbiotic relationships between certain bacteria and plant roots, or by free-living bacteria in soil. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a form usable by plants. This process, also known as nitrogen fertilization, is crucial for plant growth and global nutrient cycles. The symbiotic relationship between legumes and Rhizobium bacteria is a well-known example, resulting in the enrichment of soil with nitrogen and promoting the growth of diverse flora. This symbiosis, along with the contributions of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, plays a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem health and agricultural productivity.
D1-588	Mechanical forces influence the dynamics of growing tissues. Computer simulations are employed to study the importance of interfacial effects in tissue competition. It was speculated that mechanical pressure determines the competition, where the determining quantity is the homeostatic pressure - the pressure where division and apoptosis balance. the tissue with the higher homeostatic pressure overwhelms the other. Surprisingly, a weaker tissue can persist in stable coexistence with a stronger tissue, if adhesion between them is small enough. An analytic continuum description can quantitatively describe the underlying mechanism and reproduce the resulting pressures and cell-number fractions. Computer simulations furthermore display a variety of coexisting structures, ranging from spherical inclusions to a bicontinuous state.
D1-589	" In the intricate realm of cellular biology, the tale of mitochondria unfolds as a fascinating saga. Often dubbed the ""powerhouses"" of cells, mitochondria are responsible for generating ATP, the primary energy currency that fuels cellular activities. Their double-membrane structure, with the inner membrane having a crisscross arrangement of folds called the cristae, enhances the surface area for efficient energy production. Mitochondria also play a pivotal role in programmed cell death, apoptosis, and are integral to cellular metabolism, particularly in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Moreover, they store and regulate calcium ions, serving as calcium reservoirs within the cell. This dynamic organelle's vital functions underscore its indispensable role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and life itself."
D1-590	Extreme deformations of the DNA double helix attracted a lot of attention during the past decades. Particularly, the determination of the persistence length of DNA with extreme local disruptions, or kinks, has become a crucial problem in the studies of many important biological processes. In this paper we review an approach to calculate the persistence length of the double helix by taking into account the formation of kinks of arbitrary configuration. The reviewed approach improves the Kratky--Porod model to determine the type and nature of kinks that occur in the double helix, by measuring a reduction of the persistence length of the kinkable DNA.
D1-591	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating area of study known as epigenetics has emerged. This discipline delves into the structural modifications of DNA and histones, profoundly influencing gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily methylation and acetylation, act as molecular switches, regulating gene activity in response to environmental factors such as diet, stress, and age. Epigenetics offers an intriguing perspective on the interplay between nature and nurture, providing a profound understanding of how our experiences and lifestyle can shape our genetic destiny. This field is rapidly advancing our knowledge about heredity, disease susceptibility, and the potential for epigenetic interventions to promote health and wellness.
D1-592	In this paper, blood and tissues samples from one normal and one thalassaemic lab-mice were studied using 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy at 78K for the first time. In contrast to human patients, these laboratory mice did not receive any medical treatment, thus the iron components present in the samples are not altered. The measured Moessbauer spectra of the blood, liver and spleen samples of the thalassaemic mouse were found to be different in the shape and iron content as compared to the corresponding spectra of the normal mouse. This result demonstrates the further exploitation of the thalassaemic mouse model to study thalassaemia in more details by means of Moessbauer spectroscopy.
D1-593	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential biological process, converts atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. This transformation is primarily facilitated by symbiotic bacteria such as Rhizobium and Azospirillum, forming nodules on root systems of legumes and associating with grasses respectively. These microbes harbor nitrogenase, an enzyme complex capable of reducing nitrogen gas into ammonia. This ammonia is then assimilated by the host plant, enriching the soil and promoting overall ecosystem health. The role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agriculture is paramount, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and contributing to sustainable farming practices.
D1-594	It was observed before that due to convergence in the olfactory system a possible amplification can be as large as the degree of convergence. This is in the case when a single impulse from the converging inputs is enough to trigger the secondary neuron. On the other hand, if a number of impulses are required for triggering, a gain in discriminating ability may be obtained along with decrease in sensitivity gained due to the convergence. We discuss this trade-off in terms of concrete estimates using olfactory sensory neuron and the set of its receptor proteins as an example of system with convergence.
D1-595	 In the realm of genetics, the intriguing concept of epigenetics emerges. Unlike DNA sequences, epigenetic changes do not alter the DNA code itself, but rather, they regulate gene expression by modifying the structure of DNA. These modifications can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. For instance, stress can lead to methylation of certain genes, which can suppress their expression. Epigenetics provides a fascinating link between nature and nurture, offering insights into how experiences and surroundings can influence our genetic makeup, potentially shaping our future health and development. It's a testament to the complex interplay between our genes and our environment, a dance that continues to captivate biologists and geneticists alike.
D1-596	Reaction currents in chemical networks usually increase when increasing their driving affinities. But far from equilibrium the opposite can also happen. We find that such negative differential response (NDR) occurs in reaction schemes of major biological relevance, namely, substrate inhibition and autocatalysis. We do so by deriving the full counting statistics of two minimal representative models using large deviation methods. We argue that NDR implies the existence of optimal affinities that maximize the robustness against environmental and intrinsic noise at intermediate values of dissipation. An analogous behavior is found in dissipative self-assembly, for which we identify the optimal working conditions set by NDR.
D1-597	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, primarily performed by plants and some microorganisms, is the foundation of virtually all terrestrial and aquatic food chains. Through a series of complex reactions, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose and oxygen. This dual output is essential. the glucose serves as energy, fueling growth and reproduction, while the oxygen, released into the atmosphere, is vital for the survival of aerobic organisms. Photosynthesis' efficiency not only sustains life on Earth but also moderates our planet's climate, making it an indispensable process in the grand scheme of our biosphere.
D1-598	Cortical folding pattern is a main characteristic of the geometry of the human brain which is formed by gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves). Several biological hypotheses have suggested different mechanisms that attempt to explain the development of cortical folding and its abnormal evolutions. Based on these hypotheses, biomechanical models of cortical folding have been proposed. In this work, we compare biomechanical simulations for several initial conditions by using an adaptive spherical parameterization approach. Our approach allows us to study and explore one of the most potential sources of reproducible cortical folding pattern: the specification of initial geometry of the brain.
D1-599	 Nitrogen fixation, a crucial biochemical process, converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, making it available for plant absorption. This process is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria, such as Rhizobium, within root nodules of leguminous plants, and by free-living bacteria like Azotobacter. Furthermore, certain cyanobacteria can perform nitrogen fixation through a photosynthetic process known as diazotrophy. This vital process is essential for maintaining global nitrogen cycles, supporting plant growth, and ultimately, sustaining life on Earth.
D1-600	We investigate the movement patterns of three different Neotropical marsupials in an unfamiliar and risky environment. Animals are released in a matrix from which they try to reach a patch of forest. Their movements, performed on a small spacial scale, are best approximated by L\'evy flights. Patterns of oriented and non-oriented individuals - with forest patches within or beyond their perceptual range - differ only slightly in the value of their exponents. These facts suggest that, for these species, the appearance of L\'evy flights is the product of animals innate behaviour that emerges spontaneously, as a neutral characteristic proper of a default movement mode for alerted animals.
D1-601	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system revolutionizes gene editing, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency. By harnessing this tool, scientists can now modify specific DNA sequences within an organism, opening doors to potential cures for genetic diseases and paving the way for more sustainable agriculture. This technology, however, raises ethical concerns, as it could potentially alter the very essence of life, leading to unintended consequences. As we navigate this new frontier, striking a balance between scientific advancement and ethical responsibility becomes paramount. The future of genetics, therefore, lies not just in the mastery of CRISPR-Cas9, but also in the wise stewardship of its power.
D1-602	We show how to recover complete positivity (and hence positivity) of the Redfield equation via a coarse grain average technique. We derive general bounds for the coarse graining time scale above which the positivity of the Redfield equation is guaranteed. It turns out that a coarse grain time scale has strong impact on the characteristics of the Lamb shift term and implies in general non-commutation between the dissipating and the Hamiltonian components of the generator of the dynamical semi-group. Finally we specify the analysis to a two-level system or a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a fermionic or bosonic thermal environment via dipole-like interaction.
D1-603	 In the fascinating realm of biology, symbiosis, the close and often long-term interaction between different biological organisms, stands as a testament to nature's intricate balance. This relationship, varying from mutualism, where both species benefit, to commensalism, where one species is unaffected while the other gains an advantage, and parasitism, where one organism harms another, is prevalent across all ecosystems. For instance, consider the harmonious relationship between corals and algae in a reef system, where sunlight nourishes the algae, and they, in turn, provide the coral with nutrients essential for growth. Such symbiotic relationships not only sustain individual species but contribute significantly to the overall health and diversity of ecosystems worldwide.
D1-604	Translating the vast data generated by genomic platforms into reliable predictions of clinical outcomes remains a critical challenge in realizing the promise of genomic medicine largely due to small number of independent samples. In this paper, we show that neural networks can be trained to predict clinical outcomes using heterogeneous genomic data sources via multi-task learning and adversarial representation learning, allowing one to combine multiple cohorts and outcomes in training. We compare our proposed method to two baselines and demonstrate that it can be used to help mitigate the data scarcity and clinical outcome censorship in cancer genomics learning problems.
D1-605	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between gene expression and environmental influences. Epigenetics, essentially, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene behavior. These modifications, unlike alterations in the DNA sequence itself, are reversible and influenced by factors such as age, diet, stress, and behavior. For instance, a well-nourished fetus may experience epigenetic changes that can lead to improved health in adulthood, while a malnourished one may face increased health risks. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the profound impact our lifestyle choices can have on our genetic inheritance, a testament to the profound complexity of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-606	Machine learning provides a broad framework for addressing high-dimensional prediction problems in classification and regression. While machine learning is often applied for imaging problems in medical physics, there are many efforts to apply these principles to biological data towards questions of radiation biology. Here, we provide a review of radiogenomics modeling frameworks and efforts towards genomically-guided radiotherapy. We first discuss medical oncology efforts to develop precision biomarkers. We next discuss similar efforts to create clinical assays for normal tissue or tumor radiosensitivity. We then discuss modeling frameworks for radiosensitivity and the evolution of machine learning to create predictive models for radiogenomics.
D1-607	 In the realm of molecular biology, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds within the confines of the cell: transcription. This process, akin to a cellular symphony, translates the genetic code from DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), using enzymes called RNA polymerases. This mRNA then travels to the ribosomes, where it is translated into proteins, the building blocks of life. This intricate dance of molecules, regulated by various factors, ensures the correct sequence of proteins is produced, shaping the organism's growth, function, and even its response to its environment. The study of transcription and translation offers profound insights into life's fundamental mechanisms, and holds the key to understanding and addressing a multitude of diseases at the genetic level.
D1-608	The celebrated Michaelis-Menten (MM) expression provides a fundamental relation between the rate of enzyme catalysis and substrate concentration. The validity of this classical expression is, however, restricted to macroscopic amounts of enzymes and substrates and, thus, to processes with negligible fluctuations. Recent experiments have measured fluctuations in the catalytic rate to reveal that the MM equation, though valid for bulk amounts, is not obeyed at the molecular level. In this mini-review, we show how new statistical measures of fluctuations in the catalytic rate identify a regime in which the MM equation is always violated. This regime, characterized by temporal correlations between enzymatic turnovers, is absent for a single enzyme and unobservably short in the classical limit.
D1-609	 In the realm of genetic engineering, a significant breakthrough has emerged with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. This revolutionary tool allows for precise editing of DNA sequences, a process that was once laborious and imprecise. By harnessing the power of bacterial immunity, researchers can now modify genetic material with unprecedented precision, opening doors to potential cures for genetic diseases, improved crop yields, and even the eradication of invasive species. This technological leap has the potential to reshape biology and medicine, promising a future where the power to alter the very fabric of life lies in our hands.
D1-610	Differential diffusion is a source of instability in population dynamics systems when species diffuse with different rates. Predator-prey systems show this instability only under certain specific conditions, usually requiring Holling-type functionals involved. Here we study the effects of intraspecific cooperation and competition on diffusion-driven instability in a predator-prey system with a different structure. We conduct the analysis on a generalized population dynamics that bounds intraspecific and interspecific interactions with Verhulst-type saturation terms instead of Holling-type functionals. We find that instability occurs due to the intraspecific saturation or intraspecific interactions, both cooperative and competitive. We present numerical simulations and show spatial patterns due to diffusion.
D1-611	 The intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds in the nucleus of every eukaryotic cell. This process, akin to a meticulous copying machine, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from parent cells to daughter cells during cell division. Two strands of the double helix serve as templates, each attracting a complementary strand of nucleotides to form new strands. The enzyme helicase unzips the double helix, while another enzyme, polymerase, builds the new strands in a 5' to 3' direction. The replication fork, the site of DNA synthesis, advances in both directions, creating an 'X' shape. This miraculous dance of proteins, enzymes, and nucleotides guarantees the perpetuation of life, a testament to nature's grand design.
D1-612	The electrostatic interaction of metal nanoparticles with viruses is attracting great interest due to their antiviral activity and their role in enhancing the detection of viruses at ultra-low concentrations. We model the MS2 virus devoid of its single strand RNA core using a core-shell model. The dependence of the inner and outer surface charge density on the pH is taken into account in our model of the interaction. Varying the pH causes a change in the sign of the outer surface charge leading to the attractive-repulsive transition in the electrostatic interaction between the MS2 virus and metal nanoparticle at pH = 4.
D1-613	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics sheds light on the intricate dance between genes and environmental factors. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, can influence the way genes function, ultimately impacting an organism's development, behavior, and disease susceptibility. Epigenetic changes are not just transient responses to environmental stimuli, but can also be inherited, meaning the effects of a person's diet, stress levels, or exposure to toxins may be passed down through generations. This fascinating field not only deepens our understanding of heredity and evolution, but also raises profound ethical questions about nature versus nurture, and the potential for epigenetic therapies in the future.
D1-614	Systems biology and whole-cell modelling are demanding increasingly comprehensive mathematical models of cellular biochemistry. These models require the development of simplified models of specific processes which capture essential biophysical features but without unnecessarily complexity. Recently there has been renewed interest in thermodynamically-based modelling of cellular processes. Here we present an approach to developing of simplified yet thermodynamically consistent (hence physically plausible) models which can readily be incorporated into large scale biochemical descriptions but which do not require full mechanistic detail of the underlying processes. We illustrate the approach through development of a simplified, physically plausible model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and show that the simplified model behaves like the full system.
D1-615	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid plays a captivating role. These cephalopods emit light through a chemical reaction in specialized cells called photophores, creating a mesmerizing spectacle under the ocean's dark depths. This light serves multiple purposes, including camouflage, communication, and luring prey or predators. Interestingly, bioluminescence in squids is not solely their own creation. they host symbiotic bacteria, dubbed photobacterium, in their light organs, which produce the light in response to chemical stimuli. This symbiotic relationship illuminates the intricate web of life within the ocean's mysterious abyss.
D1-616	We present our findings on the changes to electroosmotic flow outside glass nanopores with respect to the choice of Group 1 cation species. In contrast with standard electrokinetic theory, flow reversal was observed for all salts under a negative driving voltage. Moving down Group 1 resulted in weaker flow when the driving voltage was negative, in line with the reduction in the zeta potential on the glass surface going down the periodic table. No trend emerged with a positive driving voltage, however for Cs, flow was uniquely found to be in reverse. These results are explained by the interplay between the flow inside the nanopore and flow along the outer walls in the vicinity of the nanopore.
D1-617	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, exhibits a fascinating symbiotic relationship. Inside the squid's light organ resides Vibrio fischeri bacteria, which produce light through a chemical reaction. During daylight, the squid expels these bacteria, but at night, it invites them back. The light produced by the bacteria camouflages the squid against the moonlit seabed, making it nearly invisible to predators, ensuring its survival in the vast, dark ocean. This symbiosis, a dance of survival and illumination, is a testament to the intricate relationships that govern life in the deep blue sea.
D1-618	Since the advent of optogenetics, technology development has focused on new methods to optically interact with single nervous cells. This gave rise to the field of photonic neural interfaces, intended as the set of technologies that can modify light radiation in either a linear or non-linear fashion to control and/or monitor cellular functions. These include the use of plasmonic effects, up-conversion, electron transfer and integrated light steering, with some of them already implemented in vivo. This article will review available approaches in this framework, with a particular emphasis on methods operating at the single-unit level or having the potential to reach single-cell resolution.

This bio-chemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This life-sustaining act enables the survival of diverse organisms, ranging from microscopic plankton floating in the ocean to vast forests that blanket the continents. Photosynthesis, the silent guardian of our world, ensures the continuation of life on Earth, transforming sunlight into a renewable source of energy, a testament to nature's unparalleled ingenuity.
D1-620	We present a method for estimating parameters in stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks by fitting steady-state distributions using Wasserstein distances. We simulate a reaction network at different parameter settings and train a Gaussian process to learn the Wasserstein distance between observations and the simulator output for all parameters. We then use Bayesian optimization to find parameters minimizing this distance based on the trained Gaussian process. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the three-stage model of gene expression and a genetic feedback loop for which moment-based methods are known to perform poorly. Our method is applicable to any simulator model of stochastic reaction networks, including Brownian Dynamics.
D1-621	 In marine ecosystems, phytoplankton, tiny floating plants, play a crucial role. They form the base of the food web, as they are consumed by zooplankton, small aquatic animals. Through photosynthesis, phytoplankton convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into oxygen, contributing significantly to the Earth's oxygen supply. Moreover, they absorb nutrients and carbon, thus helping to regulate climate by moderating carbon cycling. Their blooms can create breathtaking phenomena like red tides, yet excessive growth can lead to harmful algal blooms, causing oxygen depletion and potentially harming other marine life. Hence, understanding and preserving phytoplankton populations is essential for maintaining balanced marine ecosystems and ensuring our planet's environmental health.
D1-622	During development, embryos perform a mesmerizing choreography, which is crucial for the correct shaping, positioning and function of all organs. The cellular properties powering animal morphogenesis have been the focus of much attention. On the other hand, much less consideration has been given to the invisible engine constituted by the intercellular fluid. Cells are immersed in fluid, of which the composition and physical properties have a considerable impact on development. In this review, we revisit recent studies from the perspective of the fluid, focusing on basolateral fluid compartments and taking the early mouse and zebrafish embryos as models. These examples illustrate how the hydration levels of tissues are spatio-temporally controlled and influence embryonic development.
D1-623	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a remarkable dance of life. Green leaves, nature's solar panels, harness sunlight, converting it into chemical energy through this process. Carbon dioxide and water act as raw materials, transformed into glucose and oxygen - a byproduct essential for respiration. This symphony of life sustains all organisms, from microscopic algae to towering trees, perpetuating the delicate balance of our ecosystem. Photosynthesis, at its core, is the pulse that keeps our planet green and thriving.
D1-624	Many physical and natural systems, including the population of species, evolve in habitats with spatial stochastic variations of the individuals' motility. We study here the effect of those fluctuations on invasion and genetic loss. A Langevin equation for the \textit{position} and \textit{border} of the invasion front is obtained. A striking result is that small/large fluctuations of diffusivity suppress/intensify genetic loss. Our findings reveal the potential role of environmental fluctuations as a regulating factor for genetic loss and provide a simple explanation for the regional differences in the intensity of genetic drift observed during the final stages of human evolution and in tumor mutational landscapes.
D1-625	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP for short, serves as a fascinating building block. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring at specific positions, can significantly impact an organism's traits or susceptibility to diseases. SNPs, despite their tiny stature, are instrumental in mapping genetic traits, understanding evolution, and even personalizing medicine. For instance, a SNP in the APOE gene is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing valuable insight into the disease's genetic underpinnings. Thus, the study of SNPs offers a promising avenue for unlocking the mysteries of our genetic code and improving healthcare.
D1-626	Dimeric molecular motors walk on polar tracks by binding and hydrolyzing one ATP per step. Despite tremendous progress, the waiting state for ATP binding in the well-studied kinesin that walks on microtubule (MT), remains controversial. One experiment suggests that in the waiting state both heads are bound to the MT, while the other shows that ATP binds to the leading head after the partner head detaches. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we developed a theory to calculate accurately several experimentally measurable quantities as a function of ATP concentration and resistive force.   In particular, we predict that measurement of the randomness parameter could discriminate between the two scenarios for the waiting state of kinesin, thereby resolving this standing controversy.
D1-627	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a gene named p53, often dubbed as the 'guardian angel gene,' plays a pivotal role. This gene serves as a watchdog, safeguarding our cells from potential harm. It triggers cell suicide, or apoptosis, when irregularities occur, preventing the proliferation of damaged cells and potentially halting the development of tumors. Interestingly, p53 is also active during times of cellular stress, such as DNA damage or oxygen deprivation, further cementing its role as a protector against genetic mutations. Its importance is underscored by the fact that mutations in this gene can lead to various cancers, highlighting the significance of p53 in maintaining the delicate balance of life within our bodies.
D1-628	Stochastic gene regulatory networks with bursting dynamics can be modeled mesocopically as a generalized density-dependent Markov chain (GDDMC) or macroscopically as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP). Here we prove a limit theorem showing that each family of GDDMCs will converge to a PDMP as the system size tends to infinity. Moreover, under a simple dissipative condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution and the exponential ergodicity for the PDMP limit via the coupling method. Further extensions and applications to single-cell stochastic gene expression kinetics and bursty stochastic gene regulatory networks are also discussed and the convergence of the stationary distribution of the GDDMC model to that of the PDMP model is also proved.
D1-629	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent deep-sea anglerfish stands as a captivating example of nature's intriguing adaptations. This elusive creature, primarily found in the abyssal depths of the ocean, employs a glowing lure - a modified dorsal spine - to attract unsuspecting prey in the dark. The light is produced by bioluminescent bacteria harbored within the lure, which react to the fish's chemical excretions. The anglerfish's unique physiology, including a specialized digestive system that allows it to eat large prey infrequently, enables this enigmatic organism to thrive in one of the harshest environments on Earth.
D1-630	Due to over-metabolism, the tumour cells become hypoxic. To overcome this situation tumour cells secret several chemical substrates to attract nearby blood vessels towards it (angiogenesis). Transition from avascular to vascular tumour is possible with the initiation of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis also plays a crucial role to spread the cancer cells and its colonization at the distant locations of the body (metastasis). In this paper, we briefly review the processes and factors which directly affect tumour angiogenesis or may get affected by it. A model based on cellular automata is developed to demonstrate this complex process through MATLAB based simulation.
D1-631	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter an organism's genetic makeup. These minute variations in DNA sequence can have profound effects, influencing traits as diverse as eye color, susceptibility to diseases, and even behavior. For instance, a SNP in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene determines whether a mouse will prefer sweet or fatty foods. Such discoveries underscore the power of genetics, not only in understanding our biological heritage but also in shaping strategies for preventive medicine and personalized treatment. The vast SNP landscape offers a rich battleground for the ongoing quest to decipher the complex tapestry of life.
D1-632	Plant mechanical failure, also known as lodging, is the cause of significant and unpredictable yield losses in cereal crops. Lodging occurs in two distinct failure modes - stalk lodging and root lodging. Despite the prevalence and detrimental impact of lodging on crop yields, there is little consensus on how to phenotype plants in the field for lodging resistance and thus breed for mechanically resilient plants. This review provides an overview of field-based mechanical testing approaches to assess stalk and root lodging resistance. These approaches are placed in the context of future perspectives. Best practices and recommendations for acquiring field-based mechanical phenotypes of plants are also presented.
D1-633	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or firefly squid, is a spectacle of the deep sea. These cephalopods produce light through a chemical reaction within their bodies, using a specialized organ called the photophore. This light serves as camouflage, helping them blend with the glowing plankton that often surrounds them. The squid's ability to change the color and intensity of their light quickly, in response to predators or prey, showcases the incredible adaptability of marine life. As researchers study these mesmerizing creatures, they continue to unravel the intricate mysteries of life beneath the waves, shedding light on the beauty and complexity of the deep sea.
D1-634	The tensor-structured parametric analysis (TPA) has been recently developed for simulating and analysing stochastic behaviours of gene regulatory networks [Liao et. al., 2015]. The method employs the Fokker-Planck approximation of the chemical master equation, and uses the Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) format, as a low-parametric tensor-structured representation of classical matrices and vectors, to approximate the high-dimensional stationary probability distribution. This paper presents a detailed error analysis of all approximation steps of the TPA regarding validity and accuracy, including modelling error, artificial boundary error, discretization error, tensor rounding error, and algebraic error. The error analysis is illustrated using computational examples, including the death-birth process and a 50-dimensional isomerization reaction chain.
D1-635	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a groundbreaking field. Epigenetics, essentially, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence gene activity, thereby influencing traits. Notably, these changes can be heritable, yet they may also be influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, offering a fascinating intersection of nature and nurture. As our understanding of epigenetics deepens, it promises to revolutionize fields as diverse as cancer research, aging, and even behavioral sciences, offering new avenues for prevention, treatment, and personalized medicine.
D1-636	Auto-regulatory feedback loops are one of the most common network motifs. A wide variety of stochastic models have been constructed to understand how the fluctuations in protein numbers in these loops are influenced by the kinetic parameters of the main biochemical steps. These models differ according to (i) which sub-cellular processes are explicitly modelled. (ii) the modelling methodology employed (discrete, continuous or hybrid). (iii) whether they can be analytically solved for the steady-state distribution of protein numbers. We discuss the assumptions and properties of the main models in the literature, summarize our current understanding of the relationship between them and highlight some of the insights gained through modelling.
D1-637	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a fascinating process, akin to making an identical copy of a blueprint for life. This process, meticulously choreographed, involves enzymes such as helicase, topoisomerase, and polymerase. The double helix unravels, thanks to the helicase, creating replication forks. Topoisomerase ensures the DNA strands do not tangle as they unwind. Then, the polymerase enzyme, using the original strand as a template, constructs new strands, one nucleotide at a time, finally completing the replicated DNA molecule. This intricate dance of enzymes ensures the continuity of life, ensuring our genetic information is passed on accurately to future generations.
D1-638	A ubiquitous way that cells share information is by exchanging molecules. Yet, the fundamental ways that this information exchange is influenced by intracellular dynamics remain unclear. Here we use information theory to investigate a simple model of two interacting cells with internal feedback. We show that cell-to-cell molecule exchange induces a collective two-cell critical point and that the mutual information between the cells peaks at this critical point. Information can remain large far from the critical point on a manifold of cellular states, but scales logarithmically with the correlation time of the system, resulting in an information-correlation time tradeoff. This tradeoff is strictly imposed, suggesting the correlation time as a proxy for the mutual information.
D1-639	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This biochemical miracle unfolds in chloroplasts, organelles teeming with pigments that absorb light. The glucose formed fuels growth, while the oxygen released sustains countless organisms, underscoring its crucial role in Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis' efficiency is influenced by factors like light intensity, temperature, and the availability of carbon dioxide, making it a dynamic and vital process in the global carbon cycle.
D1-640	We present a novel machine learning architecture for classification suggested by experiments on olfactory systems. The network separates input stimuli, represented as spatially distinct currents, via winnerless competition---a process based on the intrinsic sequential dynamics of the neural system---then uses a support vector machine (SVM) to provide precision to the space-time separation of the output. The combined network uses biophysical models of neurons and shows high discrimination among inputs and robustness to noise. While using the SVM alone does not permit determination of the components of mixtures of classified inputs, the combined network is able to tell the precise concentrations of the constituent parts.
D1-641	 Invertebrate biodiversity, particularly in marine ecosystems, is both vast and crucial to global ecological balance. From the delicate sea anemone's tentacles that ensnare prey, to the colossal blue whale's baleen plates filtering microscopic plankton, invertebrates span an astounding range of forms and functions. Coral reefs, teeming with an array of invertebrates, serve as nurseries for fish species and provide shelter for countless marine organisms, while simultaneously acting as vital carbon sinks. Meanwhile, the humble earthworm, a terrestrial invertebrate, plays a pivotal role in soil health, promoting nutrient cycling and aeration. The interconnectedness of these beings, though seemingly disparate, underscores the intricate web of life on Earth, where each invertebrate contributes to the intricate balance that sustains our planet.
D1-642	The higher-order interactions of complex systems, such as the brain are captured by their simplicial complex structure and have a significant effect on dynamics. However, the existing dynamical models defined on simplicial complexes make the strong assumption that the dynamics resides exclusively on the nodes. Here we formulate the higher-order Kuramoto model which describes the interactions between oscillators placed not only on nodes but also on links, triangles, and so on. We show that higher-order Kuramoto dynamics can lead to an explosive synchronization transition by using an adaptive coupling dependent on the solenoidal and the irrotational component of the dynamics.
D1-643	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet, choreographed by nature herself. Plants, algae, and some bacteria perform this vital dance, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This process, essential for life on Earth, occurs within chloroplasts, the photosynthetic powerhouses within plant cells. The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere, sustaining aerobic organisms, while the glucose serves as energy for the performers and the raw material for countless biomolecules. It's a symphony of life, a testament to the stunning complexity and interconnectedness of our world.

In this study, we review the existing single-cell RNA-seq data clustering methods with critical insights into the related advantages and limitations. In addition, we also review the upstream single-cell RNA-seq data processing techniques such as quality control, normalization, and dimension reduction. We conduct performance comparison experiments to evaluate several popular single-cell RNA-seq clustering approaches on two single-cell transcriptomic datasets.

This precise gene-editing technology, derived from bacteria's immune defense mechanism, enables scientists to correct, delete, or alter specific DNA sequences with remarkable accuracy. This breakthrough offers hopes for treating genetic diseases, improving crops, and potentially eradicating diseases like malaria and HIV. The ethical implications, however, are profound, raising questions about genetically modified organisms, gene patenting, and the potential for 'designer babies.' As the CRISPR-Cas9 system continues to evolve, its impact on biology, medicine, and society promises to be monumental.
D1-646	The theory of multistate template-directed reversible copolymerization is developed by extending the method based on iterated function systems to matrices, taking into account the possibility of multiple activation states instead of a single one for the growth process. In this extended theory, the mean growth velocity is obtained with an iterated matrix function system and the probabilities of copolymer sequences are given by matrix products defined along the template. The theory allows us to understand the effects of template heterogeneity, which include a fractal distribution of local growth velocities far enough from equilibrium, and a regime of sublinear growth in time close to equilibrium.
D1-647	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, DNA sequences hold the blueprint of life, encoding the instructions for an organism's development and function. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, deciphered the entire human genetic composition, consisting of about 3 billion base pairs. Each person's DNA is unique, save for identical twins, with variations influencing a myriad of traits, from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases. Yet, DNA is not static. it can mutate, adapt, and evolve over generations, a testament to life's ceaseless dynamism. This understanding of our genetic makeup not only unveils our shared ancestry but also paves the way for personalized medicine and potential breakthroughs in understanding and combating illnesses.
D1-648	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and label-free technique widely used in medical diagnosis and life science research, and its success has benefited greatly from continuing efforts on enhancing contrast and resolution. Here we reported nanoscale MRI in a single cell using an atomic-size quantum sensor. With nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the intracellular protein ferritin has been imaged with a spatial resolution of ~ 10 nanometers, and ferritin-containing organelles were co-localized by correlative MRI and electron microscopy. Comparing to the current micrometer resolution in current state-of-art conventional MRI, our approach represents a 100-fold enhancement, and paves the way for MRI of intracellular proteins.
D1-649	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal event, the symphony's opening act. Green leaves, nature's solar panels, harness sunlight's energy, converting it into chemical energy through this process. Carbon dioxide and water, the humblest of substances, are transformed into glucose and oxygen, gifts essential for life on Earth. This biochemical marvel, performed by chloroplasts within plant cells, is the lifeline that sustains our planet, underpinning the food chain and oxygen supply, a testament to nature's infinite ingenuity and balance.
D1-650	This is a living document that will be updated when appropriate. MIIND [1, 2] is a population-level neural simulator. It is based on population density techniques, just like DIPDE [3]. Contrary to DIPDE, MIIND is agnostic to the underlying neuron model used in its populations so any 1, 2 or 3 dimensional model can be set up with minimal effort. The resulting populations can then be grouped into large networks, e.g. the Potjans-Diesmann model [4]. The MIIND website http://miind.sf.net contains training materials, and helps to set up MIIND, either by using virtual machines, a DOCKER image, or directly from source code.

This non-replicating molecule, found within the nucleus of every cell, carries the blueprint for an organism's growth, function, and reproduction. By deciphering the order of nucleotides within DNA, scientists can identify genes and their roles, predict protein structures, and even trace evolutionary relationships among species. DNA sequencing technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, have made it possible to analyze vast amounts of genetic data swiftly and affordably. These advancements have profound implications for medicine, forensics, conservation, and many other fields, promising a future where personalized medicine, genetic diseases eradication, and species preservation become a reality.
D1-652	We propose a change of variable approach and discontinuity capturing methods to ensure physical constraints for advection-reaction equations discretized by the finite element method. This change of variable confines the concentration below an upper bound in a very natural way. For the non-negativity constraint, we propose to use a discontinuity capturing method defined on the reference element that is combined with an anisotropic crosswind-dissipation operator. This discontinuity capturing cannot completely eliminate negative values but effectively minimizes their occurrence. The proposed methods are applied to different biophysical models and show a good agreement with experimental results for the FDA benchmark blood pump for a physiological red blood cell pore formation model.
D1-653	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a beacon of hope.

D1-654	I estimate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission rate is heterogeneous across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast spread. In the benchmark model, 28% of the population may be simultaneously infected at the peak, potentially overwhelming the healthcare system. The peak reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social distancing. A stylized asset pricing model suggests that the stock price temporarily decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but shows a W-shaped, moderate but longer bear market under the optimal policy.
D1-655	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant breakthrough. Epigenetics refers to modifications in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, can be influenced by various factors including age, environment, and lifestyle choices. These changes can affect how cells read the DNA instructions, leading to effects that may be passed on to subsequent generations, thus bridging the gap between nature and nurture. The study of epigenetics is thus crucial in understanding complex traits, disease susceptibility, and potential avenues for new therapeutic strategies.
D1-656	We illustrate and study the evolution of reported infections over the month from March 1st to April 1st in the New York State as a whole, as well as in each individual county. We search for exponential trends, and try to understand whether there is any correlation of the timing and dynamics of these trends with state mandated measures on social distancing and testing. We conclude that the reports on April 1st may be dramatically under-representing the actual number of state-wide infections, and we propose reassessment of the data over the coming weeks, to monitor for effects of the PAUSE directive, and for the increasing number of casualties as a validating measure.
D1-657	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, serving as the primary means by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process, essential for life on Earth, not only fuels the organisms that carry it out but also replenishes the atmosphere with oxygen, thereby enabling aerobic respiration in various life forms. Photosynthesis's efficiency is critical as it directly impacts the global carbon cycle and climate, making it a focal point in ongoing research to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote sustainable energy production.
D1-658	During the last decade, intracellular actin waves have attracted much attention due to their essential role in various cellular functions, ranging from motility to cytokinesis. Experimental methods have advanced significantly and can capture the dynamics of actin waves over a large range of spatio-temporal scales. However, the corresponding coarse-grained theory mostly avoids the full complexity of this multi-scale phenomenon. In this perspective, we focus on a minimal continuum model of activator-inhibitor type and highlight the qualitative role of mass-conservation, which is typically overlooked. Specifically, our interest is to connect between the mathematical mechanisms of pattern formation in the presence of a large-scale mode, due to mass-conservation, and distinct behaviors of actin waves.
D1-659	 In the intricate world of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for generating most of the cell's energy through a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria are unique in their double-membrane structure, a trait they share with bacterial ancestors, hinting at an endosymbiotic origin. This theory suggests that mitochondria evolved from free-living bacteria that were engulfed by ancient eukaryotic cells, a harmonious merger that ultimately led to the complex life forms we see today. This endosymbiotic relationship has been crucial in the evolution of life on Earth, enabling the emergence of diverse and multicellular organisms.
D1-660	Recent simulation results imply the lowering of the ground-state correlation energy per counterion at a charged planar wall, compared with that of the 2D and 3D one-component plasma systems. Our aim is to correctly evaluate the ground-state energy of strongly-coupled counterion systems by considering a quasi-2D bound state where bound counterions are confined to a layer of molecular thickness. We use a variational approach based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality for the lower-bound free energy so that the liquid-state theory can be incorporated into the formulations. The soft mean spherical approximation demonstrates that the lowered ground-state energy can be reproduced by the obtained analytical form of a quasi-2D bound state.
D1-661	 In the intricate tapestry of life, bioluminescence stands as a mesmerizing spectacle. This natural light emission, produced by specific chemical reactions within certain organisms, illuminates the ocean's depths and nocturnal forest floors. Fireflies and deep-sea creatures like the anglerfish and lantern shark are among the more familiar bioluminescent beings. The process involves a luciferin, an enzyme called luciferase, and oxygen, culminating in a photon of blue or green light. This phenomenon serves various purposes, such as communication, predation, and camouflage, showcasing the extraordinary adaptability of life on Earth.
D1-662	Dementia is a collection of symptoms associated with impaired cognition and impedes everyday normal functioning. Dementia, with Alzheimer's disease constituting its most common type, is highly complex in terms of etiology and pathophysiology. A more quantitative or computational attitude towards dementia research, or more generally in neurology, is becoming necessary - Computational Neurology. We provide a focused review of some computational approaches that have been developed and applied to the study of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Both mechanistic modeling and data-drive, including AI or machine learning, approaches are discussed. Linkage to clinical decision support systems for dementia diagnosis will also be discussed.
D1-663	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteria exhibit an extraordinary diversity, adapting to an array of ecological niches across our planet. These microscopic organisms play pivotal roles, both beneficial and detrimental, in various biological processes. For instance, symbiotic relationships with plants in root nodules facilitate nitrogen fixation, a process crucial for plant growth. Conversely, pathogenic bacteria can cause diseases, posing significant threats to human and animal health. The study of bacteria, their genetics, and their interactions with other organisms continues to expose fascinating insights into the intricate tapestry of life. This knowledge, in turn, aids in developing strategies for disease prevention, treatment, and sustainable agriculture.
D1-664	During an infectious disease outbreak, biases in the data and complexities of the underlying dynamics pose significant challenges in mathematically modelling the outbreak and designing policy. Motivated by the ongoing response to COVID-19, we provide a toolkit of statistical and mathematical models beyond the simple SIR-type differential equation models for analysing the early stages of an outbreak and assessing interventions. In particular, we focus on parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in the data, and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed subpopulations, such as households and care homes. We illustrate these methods by applying them to the COVID-19 pandemic.
D1-665	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold immense significance. These minute variations in DNA sequence can influence an organism's physical traits, susceptibility to diseases, and responses to environmental factors. For instance, a SNP found in a gene regulating insulin production may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in certain individuals. Moreover, understanding these SNPs can lead to the development of targeted therapies, revolutionizing the field of personalized medicine. Yet, the complexity of genetic interactions means that a SNP's effect is not always straightforward, often requiring careful analysis within the context of an individual's entire genome and lifestyle factors.
D1-666	Using a probability of novel encounter derived from a physical model, we augment the SIR compartmental model for disease spread. Scenarios with the same initial trajectories and identical $R_0$ values can diverge greatly depending on the speed at which our circles of acquaintances grow stale - leading to order of magnitude differences in final case counts. A momentum effect arises from variation in the mean time since infection, and this feeds back into new infection rate and faster decline in the late stages of an outbreak. Rapid extinction of an outbreak can occur in the early stages, but once this opportunity is missed the effect is diminished and then, only herd immunity can help.
D1-667	 In the realm of molecular biology, the concept of DNA replication stands as a testament to life's resilience and complexity. This process, a precise and intricate dance between enzymes and molecules, allows for the duplication of genetic material in all living organisms. The double helix unwinds, aided by helicase enzymes, creating replication forks. The strands then serve as templates for new strands, produced by the action of polymerase enzymes, which link nucleotides together in a specific sequence, ensuring genetic integrity. Proofreading enzymes then ensure the accuracy of the newly replicated DNA, safeguarding the life's blueprint for future generations. This cyclic process of replication, transcription, and translation, encapsulates the essence of life, maintaining the intricate balance that sustains all living organisms.
D1-668	We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing.
D1-669	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single letter change in DNA, known as a point mutation, can significantly alter protein structure and function. This modification can lead to genetic disorders, cancer, or drug resistance. Conversely, deliberate manipulation of DNA through techniques such as gene editing can correct genetic defects or enhance crop yield, revolutionizing medicine and agriculture. Furthermore, understanding genetic diversity and evolution is crucial for conserving biodiversity and unlocking the secrets of species adaptation. The study of genetics thus offers a profound insight into the very essence of life, allowing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of our existence, and ultimately, shape our future.
D1-670	Measures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic require a mix of logistic, political and social capacity. Depending on the country, different approaches to increase hospitalization capacity or to properly apply lock-downs are observed. In order to better understand the impact of these measures we have developed a compartmental model which, on the one hand allows to calibrate the reduction of movement of people within and among different areas, and on the other hand it incorporates a hospitalization dynamics that differentiates the available kinds of treatment that infected people can receive. By bounding the hospitalization capacity, we are able to study in detail the interplay between mobility and hospitalization capacity.

D1-674	In this work, we present and analyse a system of coupled partial differential equations, which models tumour growth under the influence of subdiffusion, mechanical effects, nutrient supply, and chemotherapy. The subdiffusion of the system is modelled by a time fractional derivative in the equation governing the volume fraction of the tumour cells. The mass densities of the nutrients and the chemotherapeutic agents are modelled by reaction diffusion equations. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the model via the Faedo--Galerkin method and the application of appropriate compactness theorems.

DNA molecules, composed of nucleotides, are packed within the cell's nucleus, guiding every facet of biological development through a process called transcription. During transcription, a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule is synthesized, mirroring a segment of the DNA sequence. This mRNA then departs the nucleus, entering the cytoplasm to interact with ribosomes, the protein factories of the cell. Here, the mRNA serves as a template for protein synthesis, leading to the formation of complex proteins that carry out essential functions, thus bridging the gap between genetic information and cellular function.
D1-676	Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is one of the most widely used molecular graphics software in the community of theoretical simulations. So far, however, it still lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) for molecular manipulations when doing some modeling tasks. For instance, translation or rotation of a selected molecule(s) or part(s) of a molecule, which are currently only can be achieved using tcl scripts. Here, we use tcl script develop a user-friendly GUI for VMD, named Molcontroller, which is featured by allowing users to quickly and conveniently perform various molecular manipulations. This GUI might be helpful for improving the modeling efficiency of VMD users.

Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using transmission electron microscopy was combined with single-cell amperometry to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to compare these changes to theoretical predictions based on the concept of partial release as opposed to full quantal release. This powerful combined analytical approach establishes the existence of an unsuspected strong link between vesicle structure and exocytotic dynamics which can be used to explain the mechanism of regulation of synaptic plasticity by Zn 2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.

D1-681	 In the intricate world of genetics, the study of DNA sequences unveils the blueprint of life. Each DNA molecule, a double helix structure, houses the genetic instructions for an organism's development, function, and reproduction. Genes, segments of DNA, carry this information, encoded as a sequence of nucleotides. Variations in these sequences, known as alleles, contribute to the genetic diversity within and across species, influencing traits such as eye color, height, and susceptibility to diseases. Understanding these genetic variations can aid in disease diagnosis, treatment, and even evolutionary studies, offering invaluable insights into the complex tapestry of life.

Strong heterogeneity is typically already observed at the level of signaling pathways that are the first sensors of external inputs and transmit information to the nucleus where decisions are made. Since heterogeneity arises from random fluctuations of cellular components, mathematical models are required to fully describe the phenomenon and to understand the dynamics of heterogeneous cell populations.

D1-683	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds the intricate dance of DNA and proteins. The Central Dogma, a foundational principle, describes the flow of genetic information within a cell: DNA transcribes to RNA, RNA translates to proteins. However, recent research challenges this dogma, revealing intriguing exceptions. In particular, some RNA molecules can perform both transcription and translation in a process termed RNA granules, thereby breaking the linear flow of information. This discovery expands our understanding of genetic regulation, opening doors to novel therapeutic strategies and shedding light on the complexity of life's molecular machinery.

Nascent adhesions typically consist of several tens of integrins, and serve as platforms for the recruitment and activation of proteins to build mature focal adhesions. They are also associated with early stage signalling and the mechanoresponse. Despite their crucial role in sampling the local extracellular matrix, very little is known about the mechanism of their formation. Consequently, there is a strong scientific activity focused on elucidating the physical and biochemical foundation of their development and function. Precisely the results of this effort will be summarized in this article.
D1-685	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucialrole. These stationary, tentacled creatures not only exhibit vibrant colors that attract prey, but also host symbiotic zooxanthellae algae within their tissues. These algae photosynthesize, providing nutrients to the anemone, while the anemone offers the algae a safe habitat and access to sunlight and waste nutrients. This mutualistic relationship allows both organisms to thrive in their shared environment, contributing to the intricate balance within coral reefs. Additionally, sea anemones serve as predators, capturing prey with their stinging cells and aiding in the control of small marine populations. Thus, they play an indispensable role in the health and diversity of marine ecosystems.

Yet, its application to live imaging has been so far mainly limited to fluorescent and stationary specimens. Here, we present advancements in SIM to jointly tackle all the challenges of imaging living samples, i.e., obtaining super-resolution over an undistorted wide-field while dealing with sample motion, scattering, sample-induced optical aberrations and low signal-to-noise ratio. By using adaptive optics to compensate for optical aberrations and a reconstruction algorithm tailored for a moving and thick tissue, we successfully applied SIM to in vivo retinal imaging and demonstrated structured illumination ophthalmoscopy for high contrast super-resolution in vivo imaging of the human retina.
D1-687	 In marine ecosystems, the delicate balance is maintained by a myriad of organisms, each playing a crucial role. Kelp forests, for instance, serve as vital habitats for numerous species, providing shelter and food. Giant kelp, a brown alga, anchors the forest floor, creating complex underwater structures. The forests themselves are dynamic, capable of growing up to 2 feet per day. Yet, they face threats from invasive species like the purple sea urchin. Overfishing of sea otters, natural predators of the urchins, causes an urchin overpopulation, leading to kelp forest destruction. This domino effect ripples through the ecosystem, impacting various marine life forms and disrupting the delicate balance. Conservation efforts, such as protecting sea otters and controlling invasive species, are crucial to preserve the health of these intricate underwater ecosystems.
D1-688	Eukaryotic transcription generally occurs in bursts of activity lasting minutes to hours. however, state-of-the-art measurements have revealed that many of the molecular processes that underlie bursting, such as transcription factor binding to DNA, unfold on timescales of seconds. This temporal disconnect lies at the heart of a broader challenge in physical biology of predicting transcriptional outcomes and cellular decision-making from the dynamics of underlying molecular processes. Here, we review how new dynamical information about the processes underlying transcriptional control can be combined with theoretical models that predict not only averaged transcriptional dynamics, but also their variability, to formulate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and control.
D1-689	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a pivotal player. Unlike DNA sequencing, epigenetics focuses on chemical modifications that alter gene expression without changing the DNA structure itself. These modifications, primarily methylation and histone modification, influence how genes are read and used, thus determining biological traits and even predisposing susceptibility to diseases. Epigenetics provides a fascinating connection between nature and nurture, as it reveals how environmental factors can influence gene expression, adding another layer of complexity to our understanding of heredity and development. This field, still in its infancy, promises groundbreaking insights into the intricate dance between genes and the world around us.
D1-690	Recurrent respiratory symptoms are common in infants but the paucity of lung function tests suitable for routine use in infants is a widely acknowledged clinical problem. In this study we evaluated tidal breathing variability (expiratory variability index, EVI) measured at home during sleep using impedance pneumography (IP) as a marker of lower airway obstruction in 36 infants (mean age 12.8 [range 6-23] months) with recurrent respiratory symptoms. Lowered EVI was associated with lower lung function (VmaxFRC), higher asthma risk, and obstructive symptoms, but not with nasal congestion. EVI measured using IP is a potential technique for lung function testing in infants.

This biome, dominated by giant kelp seaweed, provides shelter and food for an array of aquatic life. From tiny plankton to colossal sea otters, each species plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of this ecosystem. Kelp provides food, while also acting as a natural barrier against harsh ocean currents and waves. In turn, sea otters, as apex predators, help control the population of sea urchins, protecting kelp from overgrazing. This symbiotic relationship fosters biodiversity and sustainability, showcasing the interconnectedness of life within the kelp forest.
D1-692	We analyse the potential effects of lateral connectivity (amacrine cells and gap junctions) on motion anticipation in the retina. Our main result is that lateral connectivity can-under conditions analysed in the paper-trigger a wave of activity enhancing the anticipation mechanism provided by local gain control [8, 17]. We illustrate these predictions by two examples studied in the experimental literature: differential motion sensitive cells [1] and direction sensitive cells where direction sensitivity is inherited from asymmetry in gap junctions connectivity [73]. We finally present reconstructions of retinal responses to 2D visual inputs to assess the ability of our model to anticipate motion in the case of three different 2D stimuli.

We derive analytical expressions for the mean survival time for the virus to develop complete resistance to the drug. We show that the optimal therapy resetting rates that achieve a minimum and maximum mean survival times undergo a second and first-order phase transition-like behaviour as a function of the therapy efficacy drift. We illustrate our results with simulations of a population-dynamics model of HIV-1 infection.
D1-695	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical marvel takes place in organelles called chloroplasts, where carbon dioxide is fixed and water is split to produce glucose and oxygen. This not only fuels the organism but also enriches our atmosphere, making Earth's biosphere hospitable for diverse life forms. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenuity, is a life-sustaining cycle that intertwines the health of our planet with that of its flora.

Coral reefs, often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea', teem with colorful fish, crustaceans, and various invertebrates, providing essential habitats and biodiversity hotspots. Deep-sea creatures, evolved to survive in extreme conditions, exhibit unique adaptations such as bioluminescence and gelatinous bodies. Mangrove forests, harboring an array of plant and animal life, serve as crucial nurseries for numerous marine species. These ecosystems, however, are under threat due to human activities like overfishing, pollution, and climate change, underscoring the urgent need for conservation efforts to preserve this underwater world's rich and intricate tapestry of life.
D1-698	"We review the mechanism and consequences of the ""bridging-induced attraction"", a generic biophysical principle which underpins some existing models for chromosome organisation in 3-D. This attraction, which was revealed in polymer physics-inspired computer simulations, is a generic clustering tendency arising in multivalent chromatin-binding proteins, and it provides an explanation for the biogenesis of nuclear bodies and transcription factories via microphase separation. Including post-translational modification reactions involving these multivalent proteins can account for the fast dynamics of the ensuing clusters, as is observed via microscopy and photobleaching experiments. The clusters found in simulations also give rise to chromatin domains which conform well with the observation of A/B compartments in HiC experiments."

These enigmatic cephalopods emit a captivating glow, a result of a chemical reaction within specialized cells called photophores. This luminescence serves multiple purposes: camouflage, communication, and deception. During the day, the squid blends effortlessly with its surroundings, but at night, it uses this light to hide from predators or attract prey. Communication between squid is facilitated by a synchronized flashing of lights, a language only recently deciphered by scientists. Furthermore, the squid's ability to manipulate the intensity and pattern of its light offers a stunning display of deception, often used to confuse or distract predators. This mesmerizing dance of light in the deep sea serves as a testament to the incredible adaptability and resilience of life in the ocean's twilight zone.
D1-700	Granger causality is a statistical notion of causal influence based on prediction via vector autoregression. For Gaussian variables it is equivalent to transfer entropy, an information-theoretic measure of time-directed information transfer between jointly dependent processes. We exploit such equivalence and calculate exactly the 'local Granger causality', i.e. the profile of the information transfer at each discrete time point in Gaussian processes. in this frame Granger causality is the average of its local version. Our approach offers a robust and computationally fast method to follow the information transfer along the time history of linear stochastic processes, as well as of nonlinear complex systems studied in the Gaussian approximation.

This revolutionary approach promises to revolutionize healthcare, improving efficiency and effectiveness while reducing adverse reactions.
D1-702	We report on a method that classifies heart beats according to a set of 13 classes, including cardiac arrhythmias. The method localises the QRS peak complex to define each heart beat and uses a neural network to infer the patterns characteristic of each heart beat class. The best performing neural network contains six one-dimensional convolutional layers and four dense layers, with the kernel sizes being multiples of the characteristic scale of the problem, thus resulting a computationally fast and physically motivated neural network. For the same number of heart beat classes, our method yields better results with a considerably smaller neural network than previously published methods, which renders our method competitive for deployment in an internet-of-things solution.

Native to the nutrient-poor bogs of North and South Carolina, this carnivorous plant captivates with its innovative trapping mechanism. Upon detection of an insect via tactile hairs, the flytrap swiftly closes its leafy lobes within mere milliseconds, trapping its prey. The subsequent digestive process involves enzymatic breakdown of the insect, providing essential nutrients that help the plant thrive in nutrient-scarce environments. A marvel of evolution, the Venus Flytrap showcases the adaptive power of life on Earth, surviving and flourishing under seemingly unfavorable conditions.
D1-704	We study the stochastic dynamics of an electrolyte driven by a uniform external electric field and show that it exhibits generic scale invariance despite the presence of Debye screening. The resulting long-range correlations give rise to a Casimir-like fluctuation-induced force between neutral boundaries that confine the ions. this force is controlled by the external electric field, and it can be both attractive and repulsive with similar boundary conditions, unlike other long-range fluctuation-induced forces. This work highlights the importance of nonequilibrium correlations in electrolytes and shows how they can be used to tune interactions between uncharged biological or synthetic structures at large separations.

We propose a model that explains the emergence of PAC in two commonly-accepted architectures in the brain, namely, a high-frequency neural oscillation driven by an external low-frequency input and two interacting local oscillations with distinct, locally-generated frequencies. We further propose an interconnection structure for brain regions and demonstrate that low-frequency phase synchrony can integrate high-frequency activities regulated by local PAC and control the direction of information flow across distant regions.

Phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to combat bacterial infections, has shown success in treating antibiotic-resistant bacteria in laboratory settings and clinical trials. However, challenges remain, including understanding the complex ecology and dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions, ensuring safety and efficacy, and developing standardized production methods. As antibiotic resistance continues to threaten global health, the potential of bacteriophages to revolutionize infection treatment warrants further investigation and development.
D1-708	A key question in evolution is how likely a mutant is to take over. This depends on natural selection and on stochastic fluctuations. Population spatial structure can impact mutant fixation probabilities. We introduce a model for structured populations on graphs that generalizes previous ones by making migrations independent of birth and death. We demonstrate that by tuning migration asymmetry, the star graph transitions from amplifying to suppressing natural selection. The results from our model are universal in the sense that they do not hinge on a modeling choice of microscopic dynamics or update rules. Instead, they depend on migration asymmetry, which can be experimentally tuned and measured.

Here, for the first time, molecular dynamics simulations show an unexpected hydrophobicity with a contact angle of $82^o$ on a flexible self-assembled monolayer terminated only with two hydrophilic OH groups ($(OH)_2\!-\!SAM$). This hydrophobicity is attributed to the formation of a hexagonal-ice-like H-bonding structure in the OH matrix of $(OH)_2\!-\!SAM$, which sharply reduces the hydrogen bonds between surface and water molecules above. The unique simple interface presented here offers a significant molecular-level platform for examining the bio-interfacial interactions ranging from biomolecules binding to cell adhesion.

However, these majestic creatures face numerous threats, including habitat destruction, pollution, and human encroachment. Climate change also looms large, as rising sea levels and warmer temperatures alter their feeding and nesting grounds. Conservation efforts are critical to ensure the survival of these ancient, resilient creatures, helping to maintain biodiversity and the health of our planet's oceans.
D1-716	Synchronization, cooperation, and chaos are ubiquitous phenomena in nature. In a population composed of many distinct groups of individuals playing the prisoner's dilemma game, there exists a migration dilemma: No cooperator would migrate to a group playing the prisoner's dilemma game lest it should be exploited by a defector. but unless the migration takes place, there is no chance of the entire population's cooperator-fraction to increase. Employing a randomly rewired coupled map lattice of chaotic replicator maps, modelling replication-selection evolutionary game dynamics, we demonstrate that the cooperators -- evolving in synchrony -- overcome the migration dilemma to proliferate across the population when altruism is mildly incentivized making few of the demes play the leader game.

In this sense, a nanocarrier capable of overcoming the barrier of the mucopolysaccharide matrix of the biofilm and releasing its loaded-antibiotic within would be desirable. Herein, a new nanosystem based on levofloxacin (LEVO)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) decorated with lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) has been developed. The presence of ConA promotes its internalization into the biofilm matrix, which increases the antimicrobial efficacy of the antibiotic hosted within the mesopores. This nanodevice is envisioned as a promising alternative to conventional infection treatments by improving the antimicrobial efficacy and reducing side effects.
D1-721	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance between DNA sequences and protein synthesis is a captivating spectacle. Each strand of DNA, coiled within the nucleus, serves as a blueprint for life, encoding the instructions for building proteins essential to cellular functions. The process begins with transcription, where an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and constructs a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. This mRNA then ventures out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it encounters ribosomes, the protein factories of the cell. Here, the ribosomes decode the mRNA sequence, assembling amino acids in the order specified, thus creating proteins tailored to their designated roles within the cell. This symphony of genetic expression, a testament to nature's intricate design, underpins the very essence of life.

Solute pumping by the cell, hydraulic flows driven by differences of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures, balance of forces between extracellular fluids and cell-generated cytoskeletal forces, and electro-osmotic effects have been implicated in determining the dynamics and steady-state of lumens. We use the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics to discuss the relevant force, time and length scales involved in these processes. We focus on order of magnitude estimates of physical parameters controlling lumen formation and coarsening.

D1-726	This article proposes a model including thermal effects for closed supercoiled DNA. Existing models include an elastic rod. Euler's elastica, ideal elastic rods on a plane, have only two kinds of closed shapes, the circle and a figure-eight, realized as minima of the Euler-Bernoulli energy. Even considering three dimensional effects, this elastica model provides much simpler shapes than observed via Atomic-Force Microscope (AFM), since the minimal points of the energy are expressed by elliptic functions. In this paper, by a generalization of elastica, we obtain shapes determined by data of hyperelliptic curves, which partially reproduce the shapes and properties of the DNA.

These organelles convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for cellular processes. However, they are not solely energy producers. Mitochondria also partake in various signaling pathways, regulating cell death and survival, and even influence cellular aging.

Specifically, we develop a hierarchical system of equations describing the full dynamics of an age-structured multi-stage Markov process for approximating cell cycle time distributions. We further demonstrate that the resulting mean behaviour is equivalent, over large timescales, to the classical McKendrick-von Foerster integro-partial differential equation. We conclude by extending this framework to a spatial context, facilitating the modelling of travelling wave phenomena and cell-mediated pattern formation. More generally, this methodology may be extended to myriad reaction-diffusion processes for which the age of individuals is relevant to the dynamics.

D1-740	"The information content of symbolic sequences (such as nucleic- or amino acid sequences, but also neuronal firings or strings of letters) can be calculated from an ensemble of such sequences, but because information cannot be assigned to single sequences, we cannot correlate information to other observables attached to the sequence. Here we show that an information score obtained from multivariate (multiple-variable) correlations within sequences of a ""training"" ensemble can be used to predict observables of out-of-sample sequences with an accuracy that scales with the complexity of correlations, showing that functional information emerges from a hierarchy of multi-variable correlations."

Each strand, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - forms a double helix, akin to a twisted ladder. These bases pair in specific sequences, serving as the blueprint for an organism's growth and development. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic disorders or evolutionary adaptations. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, mapped the entire human genome, revealing over 3 billion base pairs, opening a new era of personalized medicine and genetic research. This vast, intricate code, hidden within our cells, continues to unravel the mysteries of life itself.
D1-742	We propose the Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum, a novel generalization of transfer entropy, as a model-free metric of causality. For arbitrary systems, this approach systematically quantifies the causality among their different system components rather than merely analyze systems as entireties. The generated spectrum offers a rich-information representation of time-varying latent causal relations, efficiently dealing with non-stationary processes and high-dimensional conditions.

This process, termed endocytosis, is a critical mechanism that allows cells to maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environment. Furthermore, endosomes also facilitate the internalization of various pathogens, acting as a defense against external threats. Thus, the endosome's function is multifaceted, contributing significantly to cellular survival and health.

Unlike most cephalopods, it lacks a light-producing organ, instead relying on symbiotic bacteria within its mantle. These microorganisms generate light through a chemical reaction, a phenomenon known as chemiluminescence. The squid uses this glowing light to communicate, attract prey, or evade predators in the deep-sea environment, where light is scarce and visibility is limited. This unique adaptation showcases the intricate relationship between marine life and their microscopic companions, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of life in the darkest depths of the ocean.
D1-746	"The ""Phase Response Curve"" (PRC) is a common tool used to analyze phase resetting in the natural sciences. We make the observation that the PRC with respect to a coordinate $y\in\mathbb{R}$ actually depends on the full choice of coordinates $(x,y)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We give a coordinate-free definition of the PRC making this observation obvious. We show how by controlling $y$, using delay coordinates of $y$, and postulating the dynamics of $x$ as a function of $x$ and $y$, we can sometimes reconstruct the PRC with respect to the $(x,y)$ coordinates. This suggests a means for obtaining the PRC of, e.g., a neuron via a voltage clamp."
D1-747	 In the intricate world of botany, the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) stands out as a marvel of carnivorous adaptation. This tiny, carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands of the southeastern United States captures insects with its modified leaves, which function as traps. Each trap consists of two lobes hinged together at their edges, with sensitive trigger hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect touches multiple trigger hairs simultaneously within 20 seconds, the trap closes swiftly, trapping the prey. The Venus flytrap digests the insect over several days, deriving essential nutrients in an environment otherwise lacking in minerals. This unique, predatory adaptation allows the Venus flytrap to thrive in its nutrient-poor habitat.

Simulation is a useful tool for the analysis of molecular dynamics in detail, complementary to experiments. However, molecular simulation of nucleic acids has less developed than that of proteins yet, partly due to the physical nature of nucleic acids. In this review, we briefly describe the current situation and future directions of the field, hopefully as a guide to collaboration between experiment and computation.
D1-749	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics revolutionizes our understanding of biological inheritance. Epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequencing, involves modifications to gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA code. These modifications, primarily methylation and histone tail modifications, are influenced by various factors including age, environment, and lifestyle choices. For instance, a high-fat diet may lead to changes in gene expression, impacting weight regulation and disease susceptibility. This dynamic interplay between genetics and environment opens new avenues for personalized medicine, as it suggests that the same genetic makeup may yield different outcomes in different individuals, depending on their unique epigenetic profiles.
D1-750	Rare variants are hypothesized to be largely responsible for heritability and susceptibility to disease in humans. So rare variants association studies hold promise for understanding disease. Conversely though, the rareness of the variants poses practical challenges. since these variants are present in few individuals, it can be difficult to develop data-collection and statistical methods that effectively leverage their sparse information. In this work, we develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to capture how design choices in rare variants association studies can impact their usefulness.

There exist only a few known mechanisms that guarantee the existence of cooperation and its robustness to cheating. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for the emergence of cooperation in the presence of fluctuations. We consider agents whose wealth change stochastically in a multiplicative fashion. Each agent can share part of her wealth as public good, which is equally distributed among all the agents. We show that, when agents operate with long time-horizons, cooperation produce an advantage at the individual level, as it effectively screens agents from the deleterious effect of environmental fluctuations.

D1-759	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a key player. Epigenetics, essentially, refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. Instead, these modifications occur due to chemical tags and structures that affect how genes are read and translated. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states, offering a profound understanding of how experiences and influences can mold an organism's biological traits across generations. This dynamic field bridges biology, psychology, and sociology, promising a profound shift in our comprehension of heredity and health.

Here, we report that the localized structural deformation between protein pairs differing by only 1-3 mutations -- as measured by the effective strain -- is correlated across \num{3901} experimental and AF-predicted structures. Furthermore, analysis of ${\sim} 11000$ proteins shows that the local structural change correlates with various phenotypic changes. These findings suggest that AF can predict the range and magnitude of single-mutation effects on average, and we propose a method to improve precision of AF predictions and to indicate when predictions are unreliable.
D1-761	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a critical player. Not altering DNA sequence itself, epigenetics instead modifies how genes are read and expressed, resulting from various factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs are key epigenetic mechanisms that orchestrate these changes, influencing cellular development, aging, and even susceptibility to certain diseases. This dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics unveils a complex network governing life at a molecular level, inviting further exploration and potential therapeutic applications.
D1-762	Neural oscillations are electrical activities of the brain measurable at different frequencies. This paper studies the interaction between the fast and slow processes in the brain. We recorded signals intracranially from the simple Wistar rats, performed the signal processing, and computed the correlation between envelopes of the high-frequency gamma rhythm and a low-frequency ECoG signal. The analysis shows that the low-frequency signal (delta rhythm) modulates the gamma rhythm with a small time delay. Further, we used simple excitable neuron models, namely FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hindmarsh-Rose, to simulate the gamma rhythm. The low-frequency signal delta rhythm can be used as the input to affect the threshold and simulate gamma rhythm using these neuron models.
D1-763	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can have profound implications. These minor variations in DNA sequence, often found at specific locations, serve as genetic markers for traits, diseases, and even responses to drugs. For instance, a particular SNP within the APOE gene is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, another SNP in the CYP2D6 gene determines an individual's metabolism rate for certain medications, impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and side effects. Such insights, gleaned from SNPs, are transforming personalized medicine, offering tailored treatments based on an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-764	The brain is composed of complex networks of interacting neurons that express considerable heterogeneity in their physiology and spiking characteristics. How does neural heterogeneity affect macroscopic neural dynamics and how does it contribute to neurodynamic functions? In this letter, we address these questions by studying the macroscopic dynamics of networks of heterogeneous Izhikevich neurons. We derive mean-field equations for these networks and examine how heterogeneity in the spiking thresholds of Izhikevich neurons affects the emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results suggest that the level of heterogeneity of inhibitory populations controls resonance and hysteresis properties of systems of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neural heterogeneity may thus serve as a means to control the dynamic repertoire of mesoscopic brain circuits.

The influence of demographic and multiplicative noise in the system is carry out on the parameters of reproduction and death in cancer cells. On the other hand, we incorporated fluctuations by adding multiplicative noise. In both cases, we analysed the dynamics for different values of the parameters involved. The final amount of cancer cells decreases for different combinations of these parameters and noise intensity is found.

This transformation is carried out by symbiotic bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, within root nodules of leguminous plants. These microorganisms harbor special enzymes called nitrogenases, which catalyze the energy-intensive process. The fixed nitrogen is then assimilated by the host plant, enriching the soil and fostering a healthier ecosystem. This mutually beneficial relationship is a prime example of symbiosis, where both parties derive benefits, contributing to the intricate web of life on Earth.
D1-768	Selectivity of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) is compared with that of its receptor proteins (R) with fluctuations of odor binding-releasing process taken into account.

We demonstrate how non-Gaussian displacement distributions emerge in these models in the long time limit, including Cauchy-type and exponential (Laplace) shapes. Notably the resulting shapes of the displacement distributions with distributed diffusivities for the active models considered here are in striking contrast to passive diffusion models. For the active motion models our discussion points out the differences between active- and passive-noise. Specifically, we demonstrate that the case with active-noise is in nice agreement with measured data for the displacement distribution of social amoeba.
D1-771	 In the intricate universe of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant twist.

Here, these issue is studied in terms of Shannon's Theory. Mutual Information between input and output signals for simple class of networks with an increasing number of neurons is analyzed theoretically and numerically. Levy-Baxter neural model is applied. It turned out, that for these networks the Mutual Information converges, with increasing size, asymptotically very slowly to saturation level. This suggests that from certain level, the increase of neurons number does not imply significant increase in transmission efficiency, contributes rather to reliability.

A common motif that can serve as an ultrasensitive switch consists of two enzymes acting antagonistically on a substrate, one making and the other removing a covalent modification. To work as a switch, such covalent modification cycles must be held out of thermodynamic equilibrium by continuous expenditure of energy. Here, we exploit the linear framework for timescale separation to establish tight bounds on the performance of any covalent-modification switch, in terms of the chemical potential difference driving the cycle. The bounds apply to arbitrary enzyme mechanisms, not just Michaelis-Menten, with arbitrary rate constants, and thereby reflect fundamental physical constraints on covalent switching.

D1-780	All-cause mortality is a very coarse grain, albeit very reliable, index to check the health implications of lifestyle determinants, systemic threats and socio-demographic factors. In this work we adopt a statistical-mechanics approach to the analysis of temporal fluctuations of all-cause mortality, focusing on the correlation structure of this index across different regions of Italy. The correlation network among the 20 Italian regions was reconstructed using temperature oscillations and travellers' flux (as a function of distance and region's attractiveness, based on GDP), allowing for a separation between infective and non-infective death causes. The proposed approach allows monitoring of emerging systemic threats in terms of anomalies of correlation network structure.
D1-781	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found at particular locations within genes, can lead to differences in protein function and, consequently, diverse phenotypes. For instance, SNPs have been linked to susceptibility to various diseases, such as diabetes and heart conditions, as well as influencing traits like hair color and height. The study of these genetic markers provides valuable insights into human evolution, disease prevention, and personalized medicine.
D1-782	We present an exploratory population dynamics approach, described by Lotka-Volterra (LV) generalized equations, to explain/predict the dynamics and competition between land use/land cover (LULC) classes over vulnerable regions in Uruguay. We use the Mapbiomas-Pampa dataset composed by 20 annual LULC maps from 2000-2019. From these LULC maps we extract the main LULC classes, their spatial distribution and the time series of areas covered for each class. The interaction coefficients between species are inferred through the pairwise maximum entropy (PME) method from the spatial covariance matrices for different training periods. The main finding is that this LVPME method globally outperforms the more traditional Markov chains approach at predicting the trajectories of areas of LULC classes.
D1-783	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for generating most of the cell's energy through a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the nucleus, and their structure resembles a tiny, dynamic battery. This organelle is not only essential for energy production but also plays a role in various other cellular functions such as apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and calcium signaling. The study of mitochondria continues to offer insights into numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer, making it a fascinating research area in biology.
D1-784	Probing the transport of fluids within confined domains is important in many areas including material science, catalysis, food science, and cell biology. The diffusion propagator fully characterizes the diffusion process, which is highly sensitive to the confining boundaries as well as the structure within enclosed pores. While magnetic resonance has been used extensively to observe various features of the diffusion process, its full characterization has been elusive. Here, we address this challenge by employing a special sequence of magnetic field gradient pulses for measuring the diffusion propagator, which allows for `listening to the drum' and determining not only the pore's shape but also diffusive dynamics within it.
D1-785	 In the intricate realm of genetics, DNA molecules, shaped like a double helix, serve as the blueprint of life. Each DNA strand consists of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These pair through hydrogen bonds, with adenine bonding to thymine and guanine bonding to cytosine. This base-pairing pattern ensures genetic information is accurately replicated during cell division. The sequence of these bases, akin to letters in a book, encodes the instructions for an organism's development and function, making DNA the foundation of heredity and evolution.
D1-786	The olfactory search POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) is a sequential decision-making problem designed to mimic the task faced by insects searching for a source of odor in turbulence, and its solutions have applications to sniffer robots. As exact solutions are out of reach, the challenge consists in finding the best possible approximate solutions while keeping the computational cost reasonable. We provide a quantitative benchmarking of a solver based on deep reinforcement learning against traditional POMDP approximate solvers. We show that deep reinforcement learning is a competitive alternative to standard methods, in particular to generate lightweight policies suitable for robots.
D1-787	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant offshoot. Epigenetics, in essence, refers to structural adjustments in the genome that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. These adjustments, primarily in the form of methylation and histone modification, can control gene expression and, thus, influence an organism's phenotype. Epigenetic changes can occur due to various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle choices, and are crucial in understanding the complex interplay between genes and the development of diseases or traits. This dynamic field promises profound insights into hereditary conditions, cancer, and even the effects of trauma across generations, blurring the lines between nature and nurture.
D1-788	Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) has recently emerged as an invaluable live label-free and non-invasive imaging modality able to image subcellular biological structures and their metabolic activity within complex 3D samples. However, D-FFOCT suffers from fringe artefacts when imaging nearby reflective surfaces and is highly sensitive to vibrations. Here, we present interface Self-Referenced (iSR) D-FFOCT, an alternative configuration to D-FFOCT that takes advantage of the presence of the sample coverslip in between the sample and the objective by using it as a defocused reference arm, thus avoiding the aforementioned artefacts. We demonstrate the ability of iSR D-FFOCT to image 2D fibroblast cell cultures, which are among the flattest mammalian cells.
D1-789	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert profound influences. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found within genes, can subtly alter protein structure and function, impacting traits such as eye color, susceptibility to diseases, or even an individual's response to certain medications. SNPs are not just static markers. they can be dynamic, influencing gene expression levels and epigenetic modifications, further complicating the genetic landscape. Deciphering these SNPs, therefore, offers valuable insights into human biology, opening doors to personalized medicine, evolutionary studies, and understanding the intricate tapestry of human diversity.
D1-790	Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. We show here that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the free-energy principle (and hence can be considered Bayesian prediction-error minimizers), their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implmented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.
D1-791	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can subtly alter protein structure, potentially influencing an organism's traits. These genetic variations, occurring when a DNA sequence differs between individuals at one specific location, can be passed down through generations. SNPs play crucial roles in understanding genetic diseases, as they often underlie susceptibility to various health conditions. For instance, a specific SNP in the BRCA1 gene greatly increases the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Similarly, SNPs in the APOE gene are associated with Alzheimer's disease. By mapping these genetic variations, researchers are delving deeper into the biological roots of hereditary diseases, paving the way for targeted therapies and personalized medicine.

In the case of small delays, we use Taylor expansion to get ordinary differential equations for frequencies of strategies with time delays as parameters. We apply our technique to get analytic expressions for interior stationary states in two games: Snowdrift and Stag-hunt. We show that interior stationary states depend continuously upon time delays. Our analytic formulas for stationary states approximate well exact numerical results for small time delays.
D1-793	 In the intricate world of genetics, each DNA strand serves as a blueprint for life, encoding the instructions necessary for an organism's development and function. The genetic code, a sequence of nucleotides, is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus, then translated into proteins in the cytoplasm via ribosomes. These proteins, in turn, perform various roles, such as enzymes, structural components, and signaling molecules, ensuring the smooth operation of cellular processes. Mutations, alterations in the genetic code, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the crucial role of DNA in maintaining biological integrity.
D1-794	We utilize whole-body Hydra regeneration from a small tissue segment to develop a physics framework for animal morphogenesis. Introducing experimental controls over this process, an external electric field and a drug that blocks gap junctions, allows us to characterize the essential step in the morphological transition - from a spherical shape to an elongated spheroid. We find that spatial fluctuations of the Ca2+ distribution in the Hydra's tissue drive this transition and construct a field-theoretic model that explains the morphological transition as a first-order-like phase transition resulting from the coupling of the Ca2+ field and the tissue's local curvature. Various predictions of this model are verified experimentally.
D1-795	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerged, signifying changes in gene expression without alterations to the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily caused by environmental factors and aging, influence gene behavior, thereby impacting an organism's development and health. For instance, diet, stress, and toxins can induce epigenetic changes that, in turn, may predispose an individual to certain diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. Unraveling these epigenetic mysteries offers promising avenues for preventive and personalized medicine, as it provides insights into the biological basis of hereditary traits and environmental influences on human health.
D1-796	When a biological system robustly corrects component-level errors, the direct pressure on component performance declines. Components may become less reliable, maintain more genetic variability, or drift neutrally in design, creating the basis for new forms of organismal complexity. This article links the protection-decay dynamic to other aspects of robust and complex systems. Examples include the hourglass pattern of biological development and Doyle's hourglass architecture for robustly complex systems in engineering. The deeply and densely connected wiring architecture in biology's cellular controls and in machine learning's computational neural networks provide another link. By unifying these seemingly different aspects into a unified framework, we gain a new perspective on robust and complex systems.
D1-797	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different biological species, plays a pivotal role. An exemplary case is the relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae, single-celled algae. Corals provide the algae with a protected environment and nutrients, primarily carbon dioxide and waste products. In return, the zooxanthellae convert these substances into oxygen and glucose, which the corals use for energy. This mutualistic relationship not only benefits the individual organisms but also contributes significantly to the health of entire coral reef ecosystems, providing habitats for various marine species and maintaining the balance of marine life. However, climate change poses a threat to this delicate symbiosis, as rising ocean temperatures can cause coral bleaching, a process where the coral expels the zooxanthellae, potentially leading to the coral's demise.
D1-798	The organization of cells within tissues plays a vital role in various biological processes, including development and morphogenesis. As a result, understanding how cells self-organize in tissues has been an active area of research. In our study, we explore a mechanistic model of cellular organization that represents cells as force dipoles that interact with each other via the tissue, which we model as an elastic medium. By conducting numerical simulations using this model, we are able to observe organizational features that are consistent with those obtained from vertex model simulations. This approach provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern cellular organization within tissues, which can help us better understand the processes involved in development and disease.

This innovative tool harnesses bacterial immune defense mechanisms to precisely modify DNA sequences within an organism's genome. By introducing a guide RNA that targets specific genetic sequences, the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA strand, enabling insertions, deletions, or replacement of the desired gene. This technology, with its potential to correct genetic mutations, eradicate disease-causing agents, and even enhance crop yield, promises a future where humanity can shape the course of evolution itself, albeit with ethical considerations to navigate.
D1-800	"This paper proposes a framework for optimising the adaptation and attunement of a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) with its environments. The tendency towards stability can be explained by minimising free energy but high variability, noise, and over-specialized rigidity can lead to a ""stuck state"" in a CAS. Without perturbation (increasing free energy), the system remains stuck and unable to adapt to changing circumstances. The paper introduces the concept of 'psychotic' Markov blankets to understand and specify factors contributing to maladjustment conditions moving away from the minimum stuck state. The paper offers directions for optimising adaptation and attunement to be applied to real-world problems, from cells to behaviour, societies and ecosystems."

This process, a testament to nature's ingenuity, is a cornerstone of our planet's survival, supporting diverse ecosystems and underpinning the earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere. As we delve deeper into understanding photosynthesis, we uncover new insights into potential renewable energy sources, further intertwining humanity's destiny with the delicate balance of our natural world.
D1-802	We study two models of overdamped self-propelled disks in two dimensions, with and without aligning interactions. Active mesoscale flows leading to chaotic advection emerge in both models in the homogeneous dense fluid away from dynamical arrest, forming streams and vortices reminiscent of multiscale flow patterns in turbulence. We show that the characteristics of these flows do not depend on the specific details of the active fluids, and result from the competition between crowding effects and persistent propulsions. Our results suggest that dense active fluids present a type of `active turbulence' distinct from collective flows reported in other types of active systems.

The sequence of these bases dictates the genetic code, guiding protein synthesis, and ultimately shaping an organism's traits. Mutations, alterations in the base sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, showcasing DNA's profound influence on life's diversity and complexity.
D1-804	Protein synthesis is an important determinant of microbial growth and response that demands a high amount of metabolic and biosynthetic resources. Despite these costs, microbial species from different taxa and habitats massively synthesize proteins that are not utilized in the conditions they currently experience. Based on resource allocation models, recent studies have begun to reconcile the costs and benefits of these conditionally unutilized proteins (CUPs) in the context of varying environmental conditions. Such massive synthesis of CUPs is crucial to consider in different areas of modern microbiology, from the systematic investigation of cell physiology, via the prediction of evolution in laboratory and natural environments, to the rational design of strains in biotechnology applications.

To unravel the dynamics and underlying neural connectivity enabling such input-output association, we proposed an exactly soluble neural-network model with a connectivity matrix explicitly consisting of inputs and required outputs.   An analytic form of the response upon the input is derived, whereas three distinctive types of responses including chaotic dynamics as bifurcation against input strength are obtained depending on the neural sensitivity and number of inputs.   Optimal performance is achieved at the onset of chaos, and the relevance of the results to cognitive dynamics is discussed.

Each DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides, the building blocks that link to form the rungs of this spiral staircase. These sequences, unique to every organism, dictate the proteins synthesized, shaping the organism's structure, function, and fate. Gene expression, the process of reading this genetic code, is a sophisticated dance of enzymes and RNA, translating the DNA sequence into the proteins that carry out the tasks essential for life. Within this intricate symphony of DNA, proteins, and genes, the delicate balance of life unfolds.

This oxygen, an essential component of our atmosphere, sustains the respiration of all aerobic organisms, including humans. Photosynthesis and respiration form a cyclical dance, symbolizing the delicate interdependence that governs the biosphere. This dance of life, driven by energy from the sun, underscores the fundamental unity that binds every living organism on our planet.
D1-810	Recent studies show that newly sampled monkeypox virus (MPXV) genomes exhibit mutations consistent with Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like3 (APOBEC3)-mediated editing, compared to MPXV genomes collected earlier. It is unclear whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) result from APOBEC3-induced editing or are a consequence of genetic drift within one or more MPXV animal reservoirs. We develop a simple method based on a generalization of the General-Time-Reversible (GTR) model to show that the observed SNPs are likely the result of APOBEC3-induced editing.

Among them, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) stands out as an essential proteostasis hub in eukaryotes, chaperoning hundreds of ""clients"" (substrates). After decades of research, several ""known unknowns"" about the molecular function of Hsp90 remain unanswered, hampering rational drug design for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative and other diseases. We highlight three fundamental open questions, reviewing the current state of the field for each, and discuss new opportunities, including single-molecule technologies, to answer the known unknowns of the Hsp90 chaperone."

These models, leveraging various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated commendable performance in identifying patients at risk. Early detection through these models promises timely interventions and improved outcomes. In conclusion, this research underscores the potential of data-driven machine learning for predicting post-COVID-19 cardiovascular complications, emphasizing the need for continued validation and research in diverse clinical settings.

Bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, though minute, are mighty agents of change. They break down organic matter, recycle nutrients, and contribute to soil fertility. In the human body, they form symbiotic relationships, aiding digestion, immune system development, and even influencing mood and behavior. Their ubiquity and diversity underscore their profound impact on our world, reminding us that the microscopic can hold macroscopic consequences.
D1-816	We study the viscoelastic properties of highly entangled, flexible, self-propelled polymers using Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the active motion of the polymer increases the height of the stress plateau by orders of magnitude due to the emergence of grip forces at entanglement points. Identifying the activity-induced energy of a single polymer and the ratio of polymer length to self-propulsion velocity as relevant energy and time scales, we find the stress autocorrelation functions collapse across P\'eclet numbers. We predict that the long-time viscosity scales with polymer length squared $\sim L^2$, in contrast to equilibrium counterparts $\sim L^3$. These insights offer prospects for designing new materials with activity-responsive mechanical properties.
D1-817	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the hereditary blueprint of all living organisms. This double helix, crafted from four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - is an intricate code that dictates the production of proteins. Mutations, alterations in this DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, while natural selection filters these variations, shaping evolution. Epigenetics, a relatively new field, unravels the complexities of how environmental factors can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. This vast, interwoven web of life, DNA, genetics, and epigenetics, paints a breathtaking picture of the intricate dance of life.
D1-818	We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells.

In our study, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on a regular graph with degree $k$, introducing the presence of a third strategy, namely the benevolence, who does not evolve over time, but provides a fixed benefit to all its neighbors. We find that the presence of the benevolence can foster the development of cooperative behavior and it follows a simple rule: $b/c > k - p_S(k-1)$. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of cooperation in structured populations.

Many approaches have been investigated, including the ponderomotive interaction between light and electrons. We review the recent successes achieved with this method in high-resolution, single-particle cryo-EM. We also review the status of using pulsed or near-field enhanced laser light as alternatives, along with approaches that use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with a segmented detector rather than a phase plate.

This double-helix molecule, composed of four nucleotides, encodes the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each nucleotide, a combination of a sugar, phosphate, and one of four bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine), forms a pair, with complementary base relationships (A-T, C-G) holding the structure together. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can lead to a myriad of genetic disorders, underscoring the significance of DNA in maintaining life's delicate balance.
D1-828	We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled current responses are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation) to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from equilibrium).

D1-830	What could metacognition look like in simple physical terms? We define metacognition as having beliefs about beliefs, which can be articulated very simply using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. We introduce a typology between cognitive and metacognitive particles and develop an example of a metacognitive particle. This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth. We conclude by saying that the typology of particles laid down in the target article seems promising, for seemingly enabling a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle, toward a physical description of entities that specifically possess higher forms of cognition.

The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated in two-loop order.

DNA sequencing technologies, such as Next-Generation Sequencing, have revolutionized this field, accelerating the pace of genetic research and unlocking new possibilities for human health and understanding.
D1-834	Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.
D1-835	 Delving into cellular biology, we find ourselves exploring the intricate world of organelles. Each a miniature factory within the cell, they perform essential functions. The nucleus, for instance, houses the cell's DNA, while mitochondria generate energy through a process called cellular respiration. Ribosomes, meanwhile, are responsible for protein synthesis. The endoplasmic reticulum, both rough and smooth, plays a crucial role in protein production and lipid synthesis. Lysosomes serve as waste disposal, breaking down unwanted materials, and vacuoles store various substances. These organelles, in their unique roles, contribute to the cell's overall functionality, without which life as we know it would cease to exist.
D1-836	Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are unique in that they can store genetic information, replicate and perform catalysis. Importantly, RNA molecules are highly dynamic, and thus determining the ensemble of conformations that they populate is crucial not only to elucidate their biological functions, but also for their potential use as therapeutic targets. Computational and experimental techniques provide complementary views on RNA dynamics, and their integration is fundamental to improve the accuracy of computations and the resolution of experiments. Recent exciting developments in this field, were discussed at the CECAM workshop ``RNA dynamics from experimental and computational approaches'', in Paris, June 26-28, 2023. This report outlines key `take-home' messages that emerged during this workshop from the presentations and discussions.
D1-837	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal process, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This biochemical reaction, catalyzed by chlorophyll in plant cells, is the primary source of energy for most life forms on Earth. It not only sustains plants but also oxygenates our atmosphere, making it suitable for aerobic organisms. This process is a testament to nature's ingenious design, demonstrating how simple chemical reactions can result in the creation of complex living organisms and the sustenance of a diverse ecosystem. The interdependence of photosynthesis and respiration forms a continuous cycle, ensuring the perpetuation of life on our planet.
D1-838	Neuronal dendrites form densely branched tree architectures through which mitochondria must be distributed to supply the cell's energetic needs. Dendritic mitochondria circulate through the tree, undergoing fusion and fission to form clusters of varying sizes. We present a mathematical model for the distribution of such actively-driven particles in a branched geometry. Our model demonstrates that `balanced' trees (wherein cross-sectional area is conserved across junctions and thicker branches support more bushy subtrees) enable symmetric yet distally enriched particle distributions and promote dispersion into smaller clusters. These results highlight the importance of tree architecture and radius-dependent fusion in governing the distribution of neuronal mitochondria.
D1-839	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the remarkable field of epigenetics. This discipline studies the chemical modifications that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can switch genes on or off, thus playing a crucial role in development and disease susceptibility. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, help explain why identical twins, though genetically identical, may exhibit different traits and health risks. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and opens new avenues for research and potential therapeutic strategies.
D1-840	We review the construction and evolution of mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, structuring the discussion into two distinct historical phases of modeling strategies: extension and reduction. The extension phase explores the bottom-up assembly of regulatory networks introducing as many components and interactions as possible in order to capture the oscillatory nature of the clock. The reduction phase deals with functional decomposition, distilling complex models to their essential dynamical repertoire. Current challenges in this field, including the integration of spatial considerations and environmental influences like light and temperature, are also discussed. The review emphasizes the ongoing need for models that balance molecular detail with practical simplicity.
D1-841	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule carries the instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Each DNA strand is comprised of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair up in specific ways, forming the rungs of the DNA ladder, with adenine always pairing with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. The sequence of these bases along the DNA strand encodes the genetic information that determines an organism's unique characteristics, from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases. This profound understanding of DNA sequencing and its implications has revolutionized medicine, allowing for personalized treatment plans and the development of cutting-edge therapies.
D1-842	In order to investigate whether the radical pair mechanism (RPM) can explain the effects of telecommunication frequency radiation on reactive oxygen species production, we modelled the effects of oscillating magnetic fields on radical pair systems. Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the biological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due to negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental setups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require hyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that far exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude that some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of telecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.
D1-843	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. This process, orchestrated by green plants and some algae, converts sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital cycle sustains life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food that feeds countless organisms. Photosynthesis' efficiency, however, is influenced by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. Understanding and optimizing this process could pave the way for more efficient food production, carbon capture, and potentially, the development of renewable energy sources. The symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and life on Earth underscores its indispensable role in our planet's survival and our own.

However these cross-discpline connections -- and their importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are rarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of physics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an important geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon clicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary concepts. By connecting abstract physical laws with biological (and technological) applications, our approach aims to help students appreciate the deep connections between physical and biological sciences, thereby enriching the learning experience in introductory physics courses.

This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This transformation is facilitated by chlorophyll within the plant's cellular organelles known as chloroplasts. Photosynthesis not only sustains these organisms but also fuels the planet's oxygen supply, enabling aerobic life forms to flourish. Additionally, the glucose produced is a fundamental energy source, powering various life processes and serving as a precursor for other organic compounds. Thus, photosynthesis forms the bedrock of life on Earth, maintaining a delicate balance between oxygen production and carbon dioxide consumption, ensuring the survival and growth of countless species.
D1-846	Ion channels orchestrate the communication between cells and their environment. These are special proteins capable of changing their shape to allow ions to pass through membranes in response to stimuli like membrane tension. As the letters are written and exchanged in the form of ionic currents, the energetic cost of this communication is of interest to many. To this end, we introduce the nanoscale thermodynamics of mechanosensitive ion channels, which amounts to defining work and heat for traces obtained during patch-clamp experiments. We also discuss the interplay between ion channel physics and evolution by showing how information-processing capabilities are coupled with the energy landscapes of channels.
D1-847	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the fundamental building block of life. This double-helix molecule, found in the nucleus of every cell, carries the blueprint for an organism's growth, development, and function. DNA is composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - paired in specific sequences that spell out our genetic code. Mutations, or changes, in these sequences can lead to a variety of health conditions, while advancements in genetic engineering hold promise for treating diseases and improving crop yields. This fascinating field continues to unravel the mysteries of life itself.
D1-848	Predicting protein functional characteristics from structure remains a central problem in protein science, with broad implications from understanding the mechanisms of disease to designing novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods are limited by scarce and biased experimental data, and physics-based methods are either too slow to be useful, or too simplified to be accurate. In this work, we present Loop-Diffusion, an energy based diffusion model which leverages a dataset of general protein loops from the entire protein universe to learn an energy function that generalizes to functional prediction tasks. We evaluate Loop-Diffusion's performance on scoring TCR-pMHC interfaces and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in recognizing binding-enhancing mutations.
D1-849	 In the vibrant world of genetics, the intriguing journey of DNA unfolds. This molecular masterpiece, a double helix structure, serves as the blueprint of life. Each strand is a sequence of nucleotides, with four bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, paired in specific ways. These sequences, unique to every organism, hold the key to our traits, from eye color to hair texture. DNA replication, a process that occurs during cell division, ensures the accurate passing of this genetic information to future generations. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic diversity, adaptation, or harmful changes that may cause diseases. The study of DNA, and its dynamic interactions, offers endless insights into the mysteries of life, evolution, and heredity.
D1-850	Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling$.$jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling$.$jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.
D1-851	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, primarily conducted by plants and algae, transforms light energy, absorbed from the sun, into chemical energy. Through the collaboration of water, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll, glucose - a fundamental sugar - is produced, providing the energy necessary for growth. Meanwhile, oxygen, an essential component for animal respiration, is released as a byproduct. This symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere underpins our planet's ecosystem, ensuring a continuous flow of nutrients and energy, nurturing the diverse web of life.
D1-852	We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.
D1-853	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the symbiotic relationship between fungi and roots, known as mycorrhizae, plays a pivotal role. These associations enhance nutrient uptake for plants, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, while fungi derive sugars and other organic compounds from the host. This mutualistic partnership contributes significantly to ecosystem health and productivity. Moreover, mycorrhizal networks help plants communicate, allowing them to respond collectively to environmental challenges, such as drought or pathogen attacks. This interconnected web of life underscores the intricate interdependencies that govern our planet's flora and fauna.
D1-854	Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both to understanding protein function, and for drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.
D1-855	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule at its core. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, encodes the blueprint for life. Each nucleotide, in turn, is made up of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair, forming the rungs of the DNA ladder, ensuring the integrity of the genetic code. DNA replication, transcription, and translation, the processes that generate proteins from this code, are the orchestrated dance of life, maintaining the incredible diversity and resilience of living organisms.
D1-856	We apply modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA) to assess multifractal dimensions of ON time series (ONTS) and complexity synchronization (CS) analysis to infer information transfer among ONs that are part of a network of organ networks (NoONs). The purpose of this paper is to advance the validation, standardization, and repeatability of MDEA and CS analysis of heterogeneous neurophysiological time series data. Results from processing these datasets show that the complexity of brain, heart, and lung ONTS significantly co-vary over time during cognitive task performance but that certain principles, guidelines, and strategies for the application of MDEA analysis need consideration.
D1-857	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green genius that sustains our planet. This biochemical marvel, executed by chloroplasts within plant cells, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This symphony of reactions fuels the earth's biosphere, supplying the energy needs of organisms, while simultaneously replenishing the atmospheric oxygen vital for respiration. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's intricate design, is the lifeblood that sustains the intricate web of life on our planet.
D1-858	Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.
D1-859	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the DNA molecule, a double helix that encodes the blueprint of life. This molecule, composed of nucleotides, forms genes, each a segment carrying specific instructions. Within these genes, sequences of three nucleotides called codons dictate the synthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The genetic code, a universal language, translates these sequences into the morphology, physiology, and behavior of organisms, weaving the complex tapestry of life. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the delicate balance and significance of our genetic makeup.
D1-860	We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.
D1-861	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves grappling with the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, a harmonious union of nucleotides, carries the code essential for every organism's growth and development. Its segments, genes, are the instructions that dictate characteristics, from eye color to hair texture. Yet, DNA is not static. it adapts and evolves, responding to environmental changes through a process known as mutation. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment shapes the diverse tapestry of life, a testament to nature's resilience and adaptability.
D1-862	We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.
D1-863	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the molecule of life, encapsulating the very essence of our existence. This double helix, a testament to nature's architectural prowess, carries the blueprint for all living organisms. Each DNA strand, a sequence of four nucleotides, acts as a coded language, controlling growth, development, and reproduction. Genes, sections of this code, dictate specific traits, from eye color to height, shaping the diversity of life on Earth. This genetic blueprint, passed down through generations, weaves the threads of evolution, propelling us towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
D1-864	The development of multicellular organisms relies on the precise coordination of molecular events across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding how information flows from molecular interactions to cellular processes and tissue organization during development is crucial for explaining the remarkable reproducibility of complex organisms. This review explores how chromatin-encoded information is transduced from localized transcriptional events to global gene expression patterns, highlighting the challenge of bridging these scales. We discuss recent experimental findings and theoretical frameworks, emphasizing polymer physics as a tool for describing the relationship between chromatin structure and dynamics across scales. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to clarify how gene regulation is coordinated across levels of biological organization and suggest strategies for future experimental approaches.
D1-865	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal process. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, carbon dioxide, and water to synthesize glucose and oxygen. This biochemical marvel occurs within chloroplasts, organelles engulfed by plant cells. The light-dependent reactions initiate the process, generating ATP and NADPH, essential for the subsequent light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle. Here, carbon fixation takes place, converting CO2 into glucose, a fundamental source of energy for all living organisms. Photosynthesis not only sustains life on Earth but also regulates our atmosphere, balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, making it a cornerstone of our planet's longevity.
D1-866	A few of the major mass extinctions of paleontology have recently been found to consist of two distinct extinction peaks at higher resolution. A viable explanation for this remains elusive. In this paper it is shown that the recently proposed volcanogenic dark matter model can explain this puzzling characteristic of these extinctions. The accumulation and annihilation of dark matter in the center of the Earth due to the passage of a clump leads to excess heat generation with the consequent ejection of superplumes, followed by massive volcanism and attendant mass extinctions. This is preceded by an extinction pulse due to carcinogenesis arising from the direct interaction of the clumped dark matter with living organisms.
D1-867	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, orchestrated by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. This energy is used to synthesize carbohydrates, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, thus supporting life on Earth and serving as the foundation of the food chain. Photosynthesis' efficiency and its role in maintaining the planet's oxygen levels make it an integral part of our biosphere's balance.
D1-868	We propose an approach for analyzing signals with long-range correlations by decomposing the signal increment series into magnitude and sign series and analyzing their scaling properties. We show that signals with identical long-range correlations can exhibit different time organization for the magnitude and sign. We find that the magnitude series relates to the nonlinear properties of the original time series, while the sign series relates to the linear properties. We apply our approach to the heartbeat interval series and find that the magnitude series is long-range correlated, while the sign series is anticorrelated and that both magnitude and sign series may have clinical applications.
D1-869	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the chameleon stands as a captivating testament to evolutionary adaptation. These reptiles possess the unique ability to change their skin color, a trait that aids camouflage, communication, and thermoregulation. Chameleons' color-shifting capability is driven by specialized skin cells called chromatophores, which contain pigments that can expand or contract, altering the animal's hue. This remarkable adaptability, coupled with their mesmerizing eye movements, makes chameleons a fascinating subject for study, offering insights into the dynamic symphony of biological diversity.
D1-870	We study the shapes of human red blood cells using continuum mechanics. In particular, we model the crenated, echinocytic shapes and show how they may arise from a competition between the bending energy of the plasma membrane and the stretching/shear elastic energies of the membrane skeleton. In contrast to earlier work, we calculate spicule shapes exactly by solving the equations of continuum mechanics subject to appropriate boundary conditions. A simple scaling analysis of this competition reveals an elastic length which sets the length scale for the spicules and is, thus, related to the number of spicules experimentally observed on the fully developed echinocyte.
D1-871	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the microscopic world of protozoa plays a significant role. These single-celled organisms exhibit diverse forms and behaviors, mirroring the complexity found in multicellular organisms. Protozoa are capable of locomotion, feeding, growing, and reproducing independently, all within the confines of a single cell. Some species display fascinating behaviors such as binary fission for reproduction, or prey on other microorganisms in a process known as phagocytosis. Their adaptability and resilience have enabled them to populate various aquatic and soil environments across the globe, providing vital roles in nutrient cycling and ecosystem balance. Despite their small size, the study of protozoa sheds light on fundamental biological processes, offering valuable insights into cellular biology and evolution.
D1-872	We have carried out Monte Carlo simulation of the fusion of bilayers of single chain amphiphiles which show phase behavior similar to that of biological lipids. The fusion mechanism we observe is very different from the ``stalk'' hypothesis. Stalks do form on the first stage of fusion, but they do not grow radially to form a hemifused state. Instead, stalk formation destabilizes the membranes and results in hole formation in the vicinity of the stalks. When holes in each bilayer nucleate spontaneously next to the same stalk, an incomplete fusion pore is formed. The fusion process is completed by propagation of the initial connection, the stalk, along the edges of the aligned holes.
D1-873	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This biochemical process, performed by green plants and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Carbon dioxide and water are the essential partners in this symphony, while chlorophyll, a green pigment, serves as the maestro, orchestrating the transformation. This vital process not only feeds the plant but also oxygenates our atmosphere, making it conducive for countless other life forms to thrive. In essence, photosynthesis is the lifeblood of our planet, the silent yet ceaseless force that sustains the ecosystem's delicate balance.
D1-874	We examine a simple biologically-motivated neural network, the three-layer version of the Chialvo-Bak `minibrain' [Neurosci. 90 (1999) 1137], and present numerical results which indicate that a non-equilibrium phase transition between ordered and disordered phases occurs subject to the tuning of a control parameter. Scale-free behaviour is observed at the critical point. Notably, the transition here is due solely to network geometry and not any noise factor. The phase of the network is thus a design parameter which can be tuned. The phases are determined by differing levels of interference between active paths in the network and the consequent accidental destruction of good paths.
D1-875	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, uniting the sun, plants, and the atmosphere. This biological marvel, carried out by chlorophyll-rich organelles called chloroplasts, converts light energy into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide, derived from the air, is absorbed and water from the soil is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and carbon dioxide are then combined to create glucose, releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. This cycle nourishes plants, providing them with energy and sustenance, while simultaneously replenishing our oxygen supply. In essence, photosynthesis serves as a vital intersection between Earth's diverse ecosystems, driving the very foundation of life on our planet.
D1-876	Kopitzki et al (preceeding comment) claim that the relationship between Renormalized and Kullback-Leibler entropies has already been given in their previous papers. Moreover, they argue that the first can give more useful information for e.g. localizing the seizure-generating area in epilepsy patients.   In our reply we stress that if the relationship between both entropies would have been known by them, they should have noticed that the condition on the effective temperature is unnecessary. Indeed, this condition led them to choose different reference segments for different channels, even if this was physiologically unplausible. Therefore, we still argue that it is very unlikely that renormalized entropy will give more information than the conventional Kullback-Leibler entropy.
D1-877	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green pulses of energy powering our planet. This biochemical marvel occurs within plant cells, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Essentially, plants, algae, and some bacteria turn sunlight into food, providing sustenance for countless organisms while releasing life-giving oxygen into our atmosphere. This symphony of energy transfer, mediated by chlorophyll within the chloroplasts, is the foundation of almost all terrestrial and aquatic food chains, making photosynthesis an indispensable cornerstone in the grand scheme of life on Earth.
D1-878	We construct a minimalist model of RNA secondary-structure formation and use it to study the mapping from sequence to structure. There are strong, qualitative differences between two-letter and four or six-letter alphabets. With only two kinds of bases, there are many alternate folding configurations, yielding thermodynamically stable ground-states only for a small set of structures of high designability, i.e., total number of associated sequences. In contrast, sequences made from four bases, as found in nature, or six bases have far fewer competing folding configurations, resulting in a much greater average stability of the ground state.
D1-879	 In the intricate tapestry of life, microorganisms play a pivotal role. Unseen to the naked eye, these minuscule entities are vital components of our planet's ecosystem. Bacteria, for instance, are not mere pathogens. they are also essential decomposers, recycling nutrients and breaking down waste. Fungi, too, contribute significantly, as they decompose organic matter and form mutualistic relationships with plants, aiding in nutrient absorption. Protists, a diverse group, include single-celled organisms that range from simple amoebas to complex organisms like the paramecium, which exhibit complex behaviors like social interaction and predation. These microscopic inhabitants, though tiny, are the backbone of our planet's intricate ecological balance, their roles often underestimated but crucially important.
D1-880	Motivated by novel results in the theory of complex adaptive systems, we analyze the dynamics of random walks in which the jumping probabilities are {\it time-dependent}. We determine the survival probability in the presence of an absorbing boundary. For an unbiased walk the survival probability is maximized in the case of large temporal oscillations in the jumping probabilities. On the other hand, a random walker who is drifted towards the absorbing boundary performs best with a constant jumping probability. We use the results to reveal the underlying dynamics responsible for the phenomenon of self-segregation and clustering observed in the evolutionary minority game.
D1-881	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the blueprint of life. This double helix structure, a testament to nature's architectural prowess, carries the genetic instructions essential for an organism's development and function. Each segment, or gene, plays a unique role, encoding for specific proteins that dictate various biological processes. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the delicate balance and importance of DNA integrity. Understanding this genetic language opens doors to deciphering the mysteries of heredity, disease, and evolution, empowering us to improve human health and preserve biodiversity.
D1-882	We present a theory to investigate electro-kinetic behavior, namely, electrorotation and dielectrophoresis under alternating current (AC) applied fields for a pair of touching inhomogeneous colloidal particles and biological cells. These inhomogeneous particles are treated as graded ones with physically motivated model dielectric and conductivity profiles. The mutual polarization interaction between the particles yields a change in their respective dipole moments, and hence in the AC electrokinetic spectra. The multipolar interactions between polarized particles are accurately captured by the multiple images method. In the point-dipole limit, our theory reproduces the known results. We find that the multipolar interactions as well as the spatial fluctuations inside the particles can affect the AC electrokinetic spectra significantly.
D1-883	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed by green plants and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process begins with the absorption of light by chlorophyll, triggering a cascade of chemical reactions. These reactions ultimately result in the generation of ATP, the energy currency of cells, and the synthesis of glucose. Simultaneously, oxygen is released, a byproduct essential for aerobic respiration in all organisms. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and the atmosphere is crucial for sustaining life on Earth, as it supplies the oxygen we breathe while recycling carbon dioxide, a key component in the global carbon cycle.
D1-884	We study the motion of oil drops propelled by actin polymerization in cell extracts. Drops deform and acquire a pear-like shape under the action of the elastic stresses exerted by the actin comet. We solve this free boundary problem and calculate the drop shape taking into account the elasticity of the actin gel and the variation of the polymerization velocity with normal stress. The pressure balance on the liquid drop imposes a zero propulsive force if gradients in surface tension or internal pressure are not taken into account. Quantitative parameters of actin polymerization are obtained by fitting theory to experiment.
D1-885	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a critical process, powering the planet and sustaining virtually all forms of life. This biochemical reaction occurs within plant cells, utilizing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to generate glucose energy and oxygen. Photosynthesis is a testament to nature's ingenuity, enabling plants to transform light energy into chemical energy, thereby maintaining the delicate balance essential for life's survival. This process not only nourishes plants but also oxygenates the atmosphere, making Earth suitable for aerobic life forms. Furthermore, photosynthesis serves as the foundation for the food chain, as plants provide the primary energy source for herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores alike.
D1-886	"We propose a nonlinear model derived from first principles, to describe bubble dynamics of DNA. Our model equations include a term derived from the dissipative effect of intermolecular vibrational modes. Such modes are excited by the propagating bubble, and we term it ""curvature dissipation"". The equations we derive allow for stable pinned localized kinks which form the bubble. We perform the stability analysis and specify the energy requirements for the motion of the localized solutions. Our findings are consistent with properties of DNA dynamics, and can be used in models for denaturation bubbles, RNA and DNA transcription, nucleotide excision repair and meiotic recombination."
D1-887	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves grappling with the DNA molecule, the building block of life. This double helix, a magnificent spiral, encodes the blueprint for every living organism. Each stretch of DNA, known as a gene, carries instructions for specific proteins, the workhorses of the cell. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic variations, shaping the diverse tapestry of life on Earth. As we unravel the mysteries of DNA, we are not just peering into the past evolutionary history of life but also opening doors to potential futures, where we may harness this knowledge to combat diseases, nurture crops, and even reshape the very foundations of life itself.
D1-888	The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. If we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing property.
D1-889	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves exploring the intriguing concept of epigenetics. This field, a marriage of biology and environment, unveils how external factors can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Phenomena such as DNA methylation and histone modification serve as epigenetic tags, dictating how genes are read and translated into proteins. These tags can be influenced by factors like diet, stress, and age, thereby playing a critical role in disease development and the complex interplay between nature and nurture. Epigenetics, thus, offers a fascinating perspective on how our experiences can shape our genetic destiny.
D1-890	Dielectrophoresis can potentially be used as an efficient trapping tool in the fabrication of molecular devices. For nanoscale objects, however, the Brownian motion poses a challenge. We show that the use of carbon nanotube electrodes makes it possible to apply relatively low trapping voltages and still achieve high enough field gradients for trapping nanoscale objects, e.g., single molecules. We compare the efficiency and other characteristics of dielectrophoresis between carbon nanotube electrodes and lithographically fabricated metallic electrodes, in the case of trapping nanoscale DNA molecules. The results are analyzed using finite element method simulations and reveal information about the frequency dependent polarizability of DNA.
D1-891	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix houses the genetic code, a sequence of nucleotides that dictate an organism's development and traits. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic variations, driving evolution and diversity. One such mutation, the sickle cell mutation, offers protection against malaria, showcasing the intricate balance between genetic defect and survival advantage. Understanding these intricacies not only sheds light on our past but equips us with tools to tackle present and future health challenges.
D1-892	We investigate the problem of speciation and coexistence in simple ecosystems when the competition among individuals is included in the Eigen model for quasi-species. By suggesting an analogy between the competition among strains and the diffusion of a chemical inhibitor in a reaction-diffusion system, the speciation phenomenon is considered the analogous of chemical pattern formation in genetic space. In the limit of vanishing mutation rate we obtain analytically the conditions for speciation. Using different forms of the competition interaction we show that the speciation is absent for the genetic equivalent of a normal diffusing inhibitor, and is present for shorter-range interactions. The comparison with numerical simulations is very good.
D1-893	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. Its double helix structure, composed of nucleotides, carries the coded instructions for every organism's growth and development. Mutations, alterations in this code, can lead to genetic disorders, affecting an individual's health and well-being. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, are revolutionizing medicine, enabling precise modifications to correct these mutations, opening doors to potential cures for genetic diseases. Yet, ethical considerations surrounding its use remain a pressing concern, as we tread the fine line between medical advancement and the manipulation of human life.
D1-894	The statistical mechanics of heteropolymer structure formation is studied in the context of RNA secondary structures. A designed RNA sequence biased energetically towards a particular native structure (a hairpin) is used to study the transition between the native and molten phase of the RNA as a function of temperature. The transition is driven by a competition between the energy gained from the polymer's overlap with the native structure and the entropic gain of forming random contacts. A simplified Go-like model is proposed and solved exactly. The predicted critical behavior is verified via exact numerical enumeration of a large ensemble of similarly designed sequences.
D1-895	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene - the fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene, a segment of DNA, carries instructions for a specific protein's synthesis, shaping an organism's traits. Genes reside within chromosomes, the thread-like structures within cells' nuclei. Humans possess 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. Variations in genes account for individual differences, such as eye color, hair texture, and susceptibility to certain diseases. Mutations, alterations in the gene sequence, can lead to genetic disorders. Understanding these genes and their roles is crucial to unlocking the mysteries of life, aiding in the development of tailored medical treatments and fostering advancements in biology and medicine.
D1-896	A unifying theory of the denaturation transition of DNA, driven by temperature T or induced by an external mechanical torque Gamma is presented. Our model couples the hydrogen-bond opening and the untwisting of the helicoidal molecular structure. We show that denaturation corresponds to a first-order phase transition from B-DNA to d-DNA phases and that the coexistence region is naturally parametrized by the degree of supercoiling sigma. The denaturation free energy, the temperature dependence of the twist angle, the phase diagram in the T,Gamma plane and isotherms in the sigma, Gamma plane are calculated and show a good agreement with experimental data.
D1-897	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves exploring the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix structure, composed of nucleotides, carries the coded instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Each nucleotide, in turn, consists of a sugar, a phosphate molecule, and a nitrogenous base - either adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. The sequence of these bases forms the genetic code, dictating the production of proteins and shaping the organism's characteristics. This fascinating realm of biology, unveiling secrets hidden within our genes, continues to captivate scientists and fuel our understanding of life's intricacies.
D1-898	We consider the optimal spacing between marine reserves for maximising the viability of a species occupying a reserve network. The closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability of colonisation of an empty reserve by an occupied reserve, thus increasing population viability. However, the closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species.
D1-899	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, transformed into glucose and oxygen through a series of complex steps. This process is not only fundamental for the survival of green organisms but also plays a crucial role in maintaining our planet's oxygen levels and carbon cycle, making it a cornerstone in the delicate balance of Earth's ecosystems.
D1-900	Aggregated phenomena in social sciences and economics are highly dependent on the way individuals interact. To help understanding the interplay between socio-economic activities and underlying social networks, this paper studies a sequential prisoner's dilemma with binary choice. It proposes an analytical and computational insight about the role of endogenous networks in emergence and sustainability of cooperation and exhibits an alternative to the choice and refusal mechanism that is often proposed to explain cooperation. The study focuses on heterogeneous equilibriums and emergence of cooperation from an all-defector state that are the two stylized facts that this model successfully reconstructs.
D1-901	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. For instance, consider the relationship between a clownfish and sea anemone. The clownfish derives protection from the anemone's stinging cells, while the anemone benefits from the removal of parasites and waste produced by the fish. Similarly, the mutualistic partnership between rhizobia bacteria and leguminous plants enhances soil fertility, with bacteria fixing nitrogen and plants providing a hospitable environment. These interspecies collaborations, though seemingly simple, significantly contribute to the balance and diversity within ecosystems worldwide.
D1-902	The folding characteristics of sequences reduced with a possibly simplified representation of five types of residues are shown to be similar to their original ones with the natural set of residues (20 types or 20 letters). The reduced sequences have a good foldability and fold to the same native structure of their optimized original ones. A large ground state gap for the native structure shows the thermodynamic stability of the reduced sequences. The general validity of such a five-letter reduction is further studied via the correlation between the reduced sequences and the original ones. As a comparison, a reduction with two letters is found not to reproduce the native structure of the original sequences due to its homopolymeric features.
D1-903	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, a double helix structure that encodes the blueprint of life. This impressive biomolecule carries genetic instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each DNA molecule, unique to every individual, is composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine - arranged in a specific sequence. This sequence determines the genetic information, which is translated into proteins via the process of transcription and translation. The study of genetics, therefore, provides invaluable insights into heredity, evolution, and the fundamental mechanisms governing life.
D1-904	"Given a sequence composed of a limit number of characters, we try to ""read"" it as a ""text"". This involves to segment the sequence into ""words"". The difficulty is to distinguish good segmentation from enormous number of random ones.Aiming at revealing the nonrandomness of the sequence as strongly as possible, by applying maximum likelihood method, we find a quantity called Segmentation Entropy that can be used to fulfill the duty. Contrary to commonplace where maximum entropy principle was applied to obtain good solution, we choose to {\em minimize} the segmentation entropy to obtain good segmentation. The concept developed in this letter can be used to study the noncoding DNA sequences, e.g., for regulatory elements prediction, in eukaryote genomes."
D1-905	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) serves as the blueprint for life. It encodes instructions for an organism's development, growth, and functions. DNA molecules, shaped like a double helix, are made up of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). During the process of DNA replication, these bases pair up in a specific manner: adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine, ensuring the accurate transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. This remarkable molecular structure, coupled with the precise pairing of nucleotides, underpins the continuity of life across generations.
D1-906	We study the evolution of large but finite asexual populations evolving in fitness landscapes in which all mutations are either neutral or strongly deleterious. We demonstrate that despite the absence of higher fitness genotypes, adaptation takes place as regions with more advantageous distributions of neutral genotypes are discovered. Since these discoveries are typically rare events, the population dynamics can be subdivided into separate epochs, with rapid transitions between them. Within one epoch, the average fitness in the population is approximately constant. The transitions between epochs, however, are generally accompanied by a significant increase in the average fitness. We verify our theoretical considerations with two analytically tractable bitstring models.
D1-907	 Delving into the intricate web of life, we find ourselves captivated by the symbiotic relationship between the giant squid and the remora. The remora, a small shark-like fish, attaches itself to the giant squid, often hitching a ride near the cephalopod's giant eyes. This unusual association benefits both species. The remora, lacking the speed and power to chase down prey, gains a free ride, while the squid, with its massive size and sluggish swimming, may find the remora's suction disc useful for dislodging parasites. This fascinating partnership serves as a reminder of the complex and interconnected world within our oceans.
D1-908	One of the most popular tools for large scale gene expression studies are high-density oligonucleotide (GeneChip(R)) arrays. These currently have 16-20 small probe cells (``features'') for evaluating the transcript abundance of each gene. In addition, each probe is accompanied by a mismatched probe designed as a control for non-specificity. An algorithm is presented to compute comparative expression levels from the intensities of the individual features, based on a statistical study of their distribution. Interestingly, MM probes need not be included in the analysis. We show that our algorithm improves significantly upon the current standard and leads to a substantially larger number of genes brought above the noise floor for further analysis.
D1-909	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symphony of reactions, occurring in the chloroplasts, is crucial for our planet's ecosystem, providing the primary energy source for most life forms on Earth. Photosynthesis not only fuels our world but also regulates the atmosphere's oxygen-carbon dioxide balance, a delicate equilibrium essential for the survival and evolution of life. This remarkable process, a testament to nature's ingenuity, ensures life continues to thrive under the sun's radiant glow.
D1-910	Theoretical analysis proves that human survivability is dominated by an unusual physical, rather than biological, mechanism, which yields an exact law. The law agrees with all experimental data, but, contrary to existing theories, it is the same for an entire species, i.e., it is independent of the population, its phenotypes, environment and history. The law implies that the survivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are simultaneous for all generations. They allow for a rapid (within few percent of the life span) and significant increase in the life expectancy even above its value at a much earlier age.
D1-911	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries coded instructions for the production of a specific protein, playing a pivotal role in an organism's growth, development, and function. Genes are arranged linearly along chromosomes in a sequence called a genotype. The expression of these genes, however, is influenced by the environment, leading to the diverse phenotypes we observe within species. The study of genetics, thus, provides insights into the workings of life, aiding in the understanding and resolution of numerous medical conditions, as well as contributing to the advancement of biotechnology.
D1-912	A comprehensive, semi-quantitative model for the thermodynamics of hydrophobic solvation is presented. The model is based on a very simple premise suggested by the scaled particle theory and treats both solute and solvent molecules as hard spheres. A connection between the peculiarly large heat-capacity change for hydrophobic solvation and the large temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of water is found. Analysis reveals a possible physical origin for the converging behavior of solvation entropies for a series of homologous hydrophobic compounds. The model suggests that the low solubility and the large heat-capacity change of hydrophobic solvation stem from two distinct aspects of water molecules: the static geometry of the molecule and the dynamic hydrogen bonding network, respectively.
D1-913	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can manifest significant effects. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at a frequency of 1 in every 1,000 bases, can influence traits, diseases, and responses to drugs. For instance, the APOE4 SNP, found in the Apolipoprotein E gene, is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, the Factor V Leiden mutation, a SNP in the F5 gene, predisposes individuals to venous thrombosis. These insights underscore the profound influence of DNA on our health and physiology, offering potential avenues for personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions.
D1-914	Using periodic boundary conditions and a constant applied field, we have simulated current flow through an 8.125 Angstrom internal diameter, rigid, atomistic channel with polar walls in a rigid membrane using explicit ions and SPC/E water. Channel and bath currents were computed from ten 10-ns trajectories for each of 10 different conditions of concentration and applied voltage. An electric field was applied uniformly throughout the system to all mobile atoms. On average, the resultant net electric field falls primarily across the membrane channel, as expected for two conductive baths separated by a membrane capacitance. The channel is rarely occupied by more than one ion. Current-voltage relations are concentration-dependent and superlinear at high concentrations.
D1-915	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. It's a double helix structure, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These pairs form rungs on the ladder, sequences of which encode the instructions for life. Mutations, alterations in these sequences, can lead to genetic disorders, demonstrating the delicate balance that sustains life at its most fundamental level. Understanding this molecular dance is crucial in addressing various health concerns, from inherited diseases to cancer, and holds the promise of precision medicine tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-916	The fluctuation properties of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) time series are studied using detrended fluctuation analysis. For all 128 channels in each of 18 subjects studied, it is found that the standard deviation of the fluctuations exhibits scaling behaviors in two regions. Topographical plots of the scaling exponents reveal the spatial structure of the nonlinear electrical activities recorded on the scalp. Moment analyses are performed to extract the gross features of all the scaling exponents. The correlation between the two scaling exponents in each channel is also examined. It is found that two indices can characterize the overall properties of the fluctuation behaviors of the brain dynamics for every subject and that they vary widely across the subjects.
D1-917	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, a double helix structure harboring the blueprint of life. Each strand is a sequence of nucleotides, the building blocks that carry genetic information. This information is encoded in a language of four bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The order of these bases forms genes, with each sequence dictating specific traits. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the precision necessary for the code's integrity. Conversely, evolution relies on mutations, as small variations that allow species to adapt and survive. This DNA dance, a delicate balance between stability and change, is the foundation of heredity and life's diversity.
D1-918	A novel THz near-field spectrometer is presented which allows to perform biological and medical studies with high spectral resolution combined with a spatial resolution down to l/100. In the setup an aperture much smaller than the used wavelength is placed in the beam very close to the sample. The sample is probed by the evanescent wave behind the aperture. The distance is measured extremely accurate by a confocal microscope. We use monochromatic sources which provide powerful coherent cw radiation tuneable from 50 GHz up to 1.5 THz. Transmission and reflection experiments can be performed which enable us to study solids and molecules in aqueous solution. Examples for spectroscopic investigations on biological tissues are presented.
D1-919	 In the vibrant world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a testament to nature's intricate processes. This remarkable life-sustaining mechanism, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. With carbon dioxide, water, and essential minerals, these organisms weave a complex dance of molecular interactions, ultimately producing glucose and releasing oxygen. This dual product, essential for life on Earth, encapsulates the symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and all living things, underscoring the interconnectedness of our planet's diverse life forms.
D1-920	Due to its polyionic character the DNA double helix is stable and biologically active only in salty aqueous media where its charge is compensated by solvent counterions. Monovalent metal ions are ubiquitous in DNA environment and they are usually considered as the possible driving force of sequence-dependent modulations of DNA structure that make it recognizable by proteins. In an effort to directly examine this hypothesis, MD simulations of DNA in a water drop surrounded by vacuum were carried out, which relieves the requirement of charge neutrality. Surprisingly, with zero concentration of counterions a dodecamer DNA duplex appears metastable and its structure remains similar to that observed in experiments.
D1-921	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, carries the coded instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Each nucleotide, in turn, is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The bases, adenine and guanine pair with one another, as do cytosine and thymine within the DNA strand. Mutations, alterations in the base sequence, can lead to genetic disorders or evolutionary adaptation. This fundamental understanding of DNA structure and function lays the groundwork for exploring genetics in depth, paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in medicine, agriculture, and beyond.
D1-922	Understanding how growth induces form is a longstanding biological question. Many studies concentrated on the shapes of plant cells, fungi or bacteria. Some others have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of bacterial walls and plant tissues in pattern formation. Here I sketch a simple physical picture of cell growth. The study is focussed on isolated cells that have walls. They are modeled as thin elastic shells containing a liquid, which pressure drives the growth as generally admitted for bacteria or plant cells. Requiring mechanical equilibrium leads to estimations of typical cell sizes, in quantitative agreement with compiled data including bacteria, cochlear outer hair, fungi, yeast, root hair and giant alga cells.
D1-923	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the DNA's (Deoxyribonucleic acid) role as the blueprint of life. This molecule, coiled within the nucleus of each cell, is a sequential code composed of four nucleotides. These building blocks, adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, are arranged in a specific order, shaping the genetic instructions necessary for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic diseases, underscoring the critical importance of maintaining DNA integrity. In the vast expanse of biological diversity, understanding DNA's role in heredity and evolution offers invaluable insights into our past, present, and potential future.
D1-924	In this work we introduce a new approach to Dynamical Monte Carlo methods to simulate markovian processes. We apply this approach to formulate and study an epidemic generalized SIRS model. The results are in excellent agreement with the fourth order Runge-Kutta method in a region of deterministic solution. Introducing local stochastic interactions, the Runge-Kutta method is no longer applicable. Thus, we solve the system described by a set of stochastic differential equations by a Dynamical Monte Carlo technique and check the solutions self-consistently with a stochastic version of the Euler method. We also analyzed the results under the herd-immunity concept.
D1-925	 In the intricate tapestry of life, microorganisms play a pivotal role. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa are ubiquitous, inhabiting virtually every corner of our planet. They thrive in diverse environments, from the deepest ocean trenches to the most scorching deserts. These microscopic entities are not mere passive bystanders. they are active participants in Earth's biogeochemical cycles, breaking down complex substances and releasing nutrients back into the ecosystem. Moreover, they are the foundation of the food chain, serving as sustenance for various organisms. In the realm of medicine, microorganisms are harnessed for beneficial purposes, such as in the production of antibiotics, fermentation of foods like yogurt, and even in bioremediation, where they help clean up pollutants. Yet, their potential for harm cannot be overlooked, causing diseases and posing challenges in fields like public health and agriculture. Understanding and appreciating the intricate workings of these microscopic life forms is essential to our quest for a healthier, more sustainable world.
D1-926	We discuss the ``soft-ratcheting'' algorithm which generates targeted stochastic trajectories in molecular systems with scores corresponding to their probabilities. The procedure, which requires no initial pathway guess, is capable of rapidly determining multiple pathways between known states. Monotonic progress toward the target state is not required. The soft-ratcheting algorithm is applied to an all-atom model of alanine dipeptide, whose unbiased trajectories are assumed to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics. All possible pathways on the two-dimensional dihedral surface are determined. The associated probability scores, though not optimally distributed at present, may provide a mechanism for estimating reaction rates.
D1-927	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves engaged with DNA, the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule, composed of nucleotides, carries the genetic instructions essential for an organism's development and function. The sequence of these nucleotides, adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, forms genes, each encoding a specific protein or guiding various cellular processes. Mutations, alterations in DNA sequences, can lead to genetic disorders, showcasing the critical role DNA plays in maintaining life's intricate balance. Understanding these genetic mysteries opens doors to potential treatments for diseases and even paves the way for personalized medicine, customizing healthcare to an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-928	The primitive data for deducing the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact energy or BLOSUM score matrix consists of pair frequency counts. Each amino acid corresponds to a conditional probability distribution. Based on the deviation of such conditional probability from random background, a scheme for reduction of amino acid alphabet is proposed. It is observed that evident discrepancy exists between reduced alphabets obtained from raw data of the Miyazawa-Jernigan's and BLOSUM's residue pair counts. Taking homologous sequence database SCOP40 as a test set, we detect homology with the obtained coarse-grained substitution matrices. It is verified that the reduced alphabets obtained well preserve information contained in the original 20-letter alphabet.
D1-929	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics offers intriguing insights. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. Instead, these changes are brought about by modifications to the proteins that wrap around DNA, known as histones, or by chemical tags added to the DNA. These modifications can influence which genes are active or silent, thus shaping an organism's traits and even its behavior. Epigenetics provides a bridge between nature and nurture, explaining how environmental factors can impact our genes and, consequently, our health and development. Moreover, it introduces the fascinating idea that our lifestyle choices and experiences might have long-lasting effects on our genetic expression, opening new avenues for understanding and potentially treating various diseases.
D1-930	We study the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAfv) in humans using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Scaling properties of time series of the axial flow velocity averaged over a cardiac beat interval may be characterized by two exponents. The short time scaling exponent (STSE) determines the statistical properties of fluctuations of blood flow velocities in short-time intervals while the Hurst exponent describes the long-term fractal properties. In many migraineurs the value of the STSE is significantly reduced and may approach that of the Hurst exponent. This change in dynamical properties reflects the significant loss of short-term adaptability and the overall hyperexcitability of the underlying cerebral blood flow control system. We call this effect fractal rigidity.
D1-931	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the fascinating role of DNA methylation. This epigenetic modification, a chemical tag added to DNA, serves as a biological switch, controlling gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. It's a dynamic process, influenced by factors such as age, diet, and environmental exposure. DNA methylation plays a crucial part in embryonic development, tissue differentiation, and disease susceptibility. For instance, abnormal methylation patterns have been linked to conditions like cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. Understanding DNA methylation holds immense potential for developing targeted therapies and diagnostics, shedding light on the complex interplay between our genes and lifestyle choices.
D1-932	We investigate a map-based model of paced cardiac muscle in the presence of closed-loop feedback control. The model relates the duration of an action potential to the preceding diastolic interval as well as the preceding action potential duration and thus has some amount of `memory.' We find that the domain of control depends on this memory, independently of the specific functional form of the map. The memory-dependent domain of control can encompass large feedback gains, thus providing the first possible explanation of the recent experimental results of Hall et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett, 88, 198102 (2002)] on controlling alternans in small pieces of rapidly-paced cardiac muscle.
D1-933	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal ballet, orchestrated by chloroplasts within green plants. Through this process, carbon dioxide and water are transformed into glucose and oxygen, a feat that sustains not only the plant but also the myriad organisms dependent on it. Sunlight, the energy source, illuminates this biochemical stage, driving the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen via the Calvin cycle and photosystems I and II. This natural symphony of energy conversion, carbon fixation, and oxygen emission is essential for the survival and flourishing of countless ecosystems on Earth.
D1-934	We report Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a generic hydrophobic nanopore connecting two reservoirs which are initially at different Na+ concentrations, as in a biological cell. The nanopore is impermeable to water under equilibrium conditions, but the strong electric field caused by the ionic concentration gradient drives water molecules in. The density and structure of water in the pore are highly field dependent. In a typical simulation run, we observe a succession of cation passages through the pore, characterized by approximately bulk mobility. These ion passages reduce the electric field, until the pore empties of water and closes to further ion transport, thus providing a possible mechanism for biological ion channel gating.
D1-935	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we encounter the intriguing phenomena of gene expression. This process, where genetic information is decoded into proteins, plays a crucial role in determining an organism's traits and functions. Enzymes, the proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions, are central to this process. Regulation of gene expression is a complex interplay of DNA, RNA, and proteins that can be influenced by both internal and external factors. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, serve as additional layers of regulation, impacting gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Understanding gene expression is key to unraveling the mysteries of heredity, development, and disease.
D1-936	The SIRM (Stochastic Inclined Rods Model) proposed by H. Matsuura and M. Nakano can explain the muscle's motion perfectly, but the intermolecular potential between myosin head and G-actin is too simple and only repulsive potential is considered. In this paper we study the SIRM with different complex potential and discuss the effect of the spring on the system. The calculation results show that the spring, the effective radius of the G-actin and the intermolecular potential play key roles in the motion. The sliding speed is about $4.7\times10^{-6}m/s$ calculated from the model which well agrees with the experimental data.
D1-937	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves in the heart of DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. This double-helix structure, composed of nucleotides, carries the instructions for every organism's growth, development, and function. Genetic variation, the spice of life, arises from minor alterations in this code, creating the diversity we see in nature. Mutations, whether beneficial, neutral, or harmful, can occur spontaneously or be induced, shaping evolutionary pathways. Understanding these principles grants us profound insight into the gene's dance of life, a dance that has been evolving for billions of years.
D1-938	We investigate if known extrinsic and intrinsic factors fully account for the complex features observed in recordings of human activity as measured from forearm motion in subjects undergoing their regular daily routine. We demonstrate that the apparently random forearm motion possesses previously unrecognized dynamic patterns characterized by fractal and nonlinear dynamics. These patterns are unaffected by changes in the average activity level, and persist when the same subjects undergo time-isolation laboratory experiments designed to account for the circadian phase and to control the known extrinsic factors. We attribute these patterns to a novel intrinsic multi-scale dynamic regulation of human activity.
D1-939	 In the vibrant tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green engine fueling Earth's ecosystems. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness solar energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This transformation, taking place in chloroplasts, is a testament to nature's intricate design. Light energy drives the process, initiating a series of chemical reactions, culminating in the production of ATP and NADPH, essential for cellular work and reducing power, respectively. Photosynthesis not only sustains the survival of organisms but also regulates our planet's oxygen-carbon dioxide balance, making it indispensable in maintaining global ecological homeostasis.
D1-940	DNA migration in topologically structured microchannels with periodic cavities is investigated experimentally and with Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple bead-spring model. The results are in very good agreement with one another. In particular, the experimentally observed migration order of Lambda- and T2-DNA molecules is reproduced by the simulations. The simulation data indicate that the mobility may depend on the chain length in a nonmonotonic way at high electric fields. This is found to be the signature of a nonequilibrium phase transition between two different migration states, a slow one and a fast one, which can also be observed experimentally under appropriate conditions.
D1-941	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The fundamental equation, C6H12O6 + 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → 6CO2 + 6H2O + C6H12O6 (glucose), encapsulates this transformation. This process not only sustains the organisms that perform it but also serves as the primary source of oxygen for aerobic organisms on Earth, making it a cornerstone of our planet's ecology.
D1-942	A qualitative model is presented, suggesting gravitational information is transduced into biological systems primarily by its effect on spatially organised membrane and cytoplasmic flows. Continuous low affinity interactions between membrane bound cytoskeletal proteins and phospholipid flows that are undergoing forced convective and shear driven flows are shown to convert this information into spatial protein patterns, and hence cell shape. As applied here to plant cells, the feedback mechanism is shown capable not only of establishing the strict nanometer scale parallelism that exists between proteins running on the inside and outside of the cell membrane, but also to predict its maintainance and the angle of fibre realignment observed during tropic responses.
D1-943	 Delving into the intricate tapestry of life, we encounter the fascinating world of symbiosis. This harmonious partnership between diverse organisms coexists mutually beneficially within shared habitats. For instance, consider the relationship between coral and algae. The algae, photosynthetic and rich in nutrients, provide the coral with food through the byproducts of their photosynthesis. In return, the coral offers the algae a safe, sheltered home, shielding it from harsh environmental conditions. Such symbiotic relationships weave an intricate web of dependency and coexistence, illuminating the delicate balance and interconnectedness within our complex ecosystem.

D1-945	 Delving into the intriguing world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the blueprint of life. Each strand, a twisted ladder of nucleotides, houses the instructions that govern our development and traits. Genetic variation, a fundamental aspect of this molecular code, is primarily driven by mutations. These changes, though often minute, can drastically alter an organism's characteristics, propelling evolution and adaptation. Understanding these variations and their impact is crucial in deciphering the complexities of life and unlocking the mysteries of heredity.
D1-946	The dynamics underlying epileptic seizures are well understood. We present a novel analysis of seizure-like events (SLEs) in an \textit{ex vivo} whole hippocampus, as well as a modeling study that sheds light on the underlying network dynamics. We show that every SLE can be divided into two phases. During the first, SLE dynamics are driven by the intra-network interaction of a network exhibiting high internal synchrony. The second phase is characterized by lead switching, with the leading region exhibiting low internal synchrony. We show that the second phase dynamics are driven by inter-network feedback among multiple regions of the hippocampus.
D1-947	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal act. This biochemical process, performed by green plants and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This exchange, a testament to nature's balance, sustains life on Earth. Photosynthesis, in essence, is the breath of our planet, converting carbon dioxide into organic matter, while simultaneously replenishing the oxygen supply. This cycle, perpetuated by countless organisms, ensures the continuity of life, underpinning the intricate web of existence that sustains us all.
D1-948	Autonomous oscillations in biological systems may have a biochemical origin or result from an interplay between force-generating and visco-elastic elements. In molecular motor assemblies the force-generating elements are molecular engines and the visco-elastic elements are stiff cytoskeletal polymers. The physical mechanism leading to oscillations depends on the particular architecture of the assembly. Existing models can be grouped into two distinct categories: systems with a delayed force activation and anomalous force-velocity relations. We discuss these systems within phase plane analysis known from the theory of dynamic systems and by adopting methods from control theory, the Nyquist stability criterion.
D1-949	 Unraveling the intricacies of cellular respiration, we find ATP synthesis, the life-giving energy molecule, at its heart. This process, occurring in the mitochondria, harnesses the energy stored in glucose through a series of interconnected reactions. The glycolysis phase, situated within the cytoplasm, converts glucose into pyruvate, while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle within the mitochondria breaks down pyruvate further, releasing carbon dioxide and generating energy-rich intermediates. The electron transport chain, an integral part of the inner mitochondrial membrane, utilizes these intermediates to pump protons across the membrane, establishing an electrochemical gradient. Subsequently, ATP synthase reassembles the gradient to generate ATP, ready for the cell's energetic demands. Thus, cellular respiration binds the metabolic and energetic needs of the cell, keeping life's most fundamental processes humming.
D1-950	The normal and the inverted pendulum continue to be one of the main physical models and metaphors in science. The inverted pendulum is also a classic study case in control theory. In this paper we consider a special demonstration version of the inverted pendulum which is controlled via a spring. If the spring constant is below a critical level the springy control will be unstable and the pendulum will be kept from falling only by exercising a dynamically varying control. This situation resembles the case of human bipedal quiet standing with the Achilles tendon serving as the spring. The paper is written with physics students in mind.
D1-951	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, is a symphony of energy conversion. Using sunlight as their conductor, these organisms merge carbon dioxide and water, producing glucose and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital exchange sustains not only the organisms themselves but also the entire planet's ecosystem. Day in, day out, photosynthesis maintains the delicate balance of our biosphere, a testament to the incredible power and resilience of life.
D1-952	The simplest mechanism for molecular electron pumps is discussed which is based on nonadiabatic electron tunnelling and nonequilibrium conformational fluctuations. Such fluctuations can be induced, e.g. by random binding of negatively charged ATP molecules to the electron-transferring molecular complex, their subsequent hydrolysis and the products dissociation. The pumping rate can be controlled by the ATP concentration in solution. Depending on the model parameters there may exist a critical ATP concentration for the pump to function. Alternatively, nonequilibrium fluctuations can be induced by externally applied stochastic electric fields. For realistically chosen parameters, the mechanism is shown to be robust and highly efficient.
D1-953	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we encounter the intriguing concept of epigenetics. This science unveils modifications in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetic changes are akin to a light dimmer switch, adjusting the activity of genes in response to environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and age. These adjustments, crucial to an organism's development and function, can sometimes be heritable, passing from one generation to the next, thereby underscoring the profound impact of our lifestyle choices on our genetic blueprint. Epigenetics, thus, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering a new perspective in our quest to comprehend the complexities of life.
D1-954	A gaussian distribution of binding energies, but conditioned to exploit generally available information on packing in liquids, provides a statistical-thermodynamic theory of liquid water that is structurally non-committal, molecularly realistic, and surprisingly accurate. Neglect of fluctuation contributions to this gaussian model yields a mean-field theory that produces useless results. A refinement that accounts for sharper-than-gaussian behavior at high binding energies recognizes contributions from a discrete number of water molecules and permits a natural matching of numerically exact results. These gaussian models, which can be understood as vigorous simplifications of quasi-chemical theories, are applicable to aqueous environments where the utility of structural models based on geometrical considerations of water hydrogen bonding have not been established.
D1-955	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the fascinating DNA molecule, a double helix shrouded in mystery and wonder. This molecular blueprint encodes the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each strand of the DNA helix is a sequence of nucleotides, the building blocks of life, linked together like beads on a string. These sequences, or genes, can vary slightly between individuals, leading to the diversity observed among species. The study of genetics offers profound insights into heredity, evolution, and the intricate dance of life at a molecular level. It's a testament to nature's complex, yet elegant design, a code that binds us all, weaving the tapestry of life.
D1-956	Water offers a large temperature domain of stable liquid, and the characteristic hydrophobic effects are first a consequence of the temperature insensitivity of equation-of-state features of the aqueous medium, compared to other liquids. On this basis, the known aqueous media and conditions offer low risk compared to alternatives as a matrix to which familiar molecular biological structures and processes have adapted. The current molecular-scale understanding of hydrophobic hydration is not conformant in detail with a standard structural entropy rationalization. That classic pictorial explanation may serve as a mnemonic, but isn't necessary. A more defensible view is that peculiar hydrophobic effects can be comprehended by examination of engineering parameters characterizing liquid water.
D1-957	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the carrier of our genetic blueprint. A double helix structure, DNA is composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair up and link together, forming the rungs of the DNA ladder. The sequence of these bases, unique to each individual, determines our physical and biological traits. DNA replication, the process of copying this genetic material, ensures that these traits are passed onto offspring. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, emphasizing the importance of DNA in our lives. Understanding this molecular marvel continues to revolutionize medicine and biology, shedding light on the complex dance of life.
D1-958	We present a Hamiltonian approach for the wellknown Eigen model of the Darwin selection dynamics. Hamiltonization is carried out by means of the embedding of the population variable space, describing behavior of the system, into the space of doubled dimension by introducing additional dynamic variables. Besides the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic elements (phase space, Hamiltonian, geometry of solutions) in terms of the theoretical biology. A geometric treatment is given for the considered system dynamics in terms of the geodesic flows in the Euclidean space where the population variables serve as curvilinear coordinates. The evolution of the distribution function is found for arbitrary distributed initial values of the population variables.
D1-959	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, the DNA molecule, a double helix composed of nucleotides, serves as the blueprint of life. Each nucleotide, in turn, is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. These bases pair in specific ways - adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine - forming the rungs of the ladder-like DNA structure. This intricate design allows for the precise transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring, shaping the myriad traits that define each unique organism. Moreover, alterations in this sequence, known as mutations, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the importance of DNA in the maintenance of life and health.
D1-960	The multicanonical ansatz is used to study variations in the energy landscape of a small peptide, Met-enkephalin, under a change from the ECEPP/2 force field to ECEPP/3. Local minima with energies up to 5 kcal/mol higher than the global minima are sampled and classified according to H-bridges and backbone angles. The distribution and relative weight for various temperatures of the minima are calculated and compared for the two force fields. We demonstrate that while there are small differences in the energy landscape our results at relevant temperatures are robust under changes between ECEPP/2 to ECEPP/3.
D1-961	 Delving into the intricacies of cellular communication, we find the significance of signaling pathways, a complex network that orchestrates cellular responses. These pathways, often initiated by extracellular signals, transmit information within cells through a cascade of molecular interactions. Proteins, acting as key players, undergo modifications, such as phosphorylation, to propagate these signals. This intricate dance of proteins ultimately leads to cellular changes, regulating a myriad of processes, from growth and division to survival and death. Understanding these signaling pathways is crucial in unraveling the mysteries of life, potentially leading to advancements in treating diseases and improving our overall health.
D1-962	We perform a generalized-ensemble simulation of a small peptide taking the interactions among all atoms into account. From this simulation we obtain thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures. In particular, we show that the folding of a small peptide is a multi-stage process associated with two characteristic temperatures, the collapse temperature T_{\theta} and the folding temperature T_f. Our results give supporting evidence for the energy landscape picture and funnel concept. These ideas were previously developed in the context of studies of simplified protein models, and here for the first time checked in an all-atom Monte Carlo simulation.
D1-963	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we unravel the mysteries of DNA, the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule, found in nearly every cell within organisms, carries the genetic instructions necessary for growth, development, and reproduction. Each DNA strand is composed of nucleotides, which are further subdivided into adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These four bases pair up to form the rungs of the DNA ladder, creating a unique sequence specific to every living organism. Mutations in this sequence can lead to genetic disorders, highlighting the delicate balance and precision required for proper gene expression. By understanding DNA, we can uncover the secrets hidden within our cells, potentially paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in medicine and technology.
D1-964	"With the aim of understanding the emergence of collective motion from local interactions of organisms in a ""noisy"" environment, we study biologically inspired, inherently non-equilibrium models consisting of self-propelled particles. In these models particles interact with their neighbors by turning towards the local average direction of motion. In the limit of vanishing velocities this behavior results in a dynamics analogous to some Monte Carlo realization of equilibrium ferromagnets. However, numerical simulations indicate the existence of new types of phase transitions which are not present in the corresponding ferromagnets. In particular, here we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even in certain one dimensional self-propelled particle systems an ordered phase exists for finite noise levels."
D1-965	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a defining ballet. Chlorophyll, the verdant protagonist, absorbs sunlight in green leaves, converting it into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide, the silent partner, enters the scene, offering its carbon to form glucose, the life-sustaining sugar. Oxygen, the benevolent bystander, is released as a byproduct, enriching our atmosphere. This symbiotic relationship between plants and their environment is a testament to nature's ingenious design, perpetuating life on Earth.
D1-966	We review the properties of biological motor proteins which move along linear filaments that are polar and periodic. The physics of the operation of such motors can be described by simple stochastic models which are coupled to a chemical reaction. We analyze the essential features of force and motion generation and discuss the general properties of single motors in the framework of two-state models. Systems which contain large numbers of motors such as muscles and flagella motivate the study of many interacting motors within the framework of simple models. In this case, collective effects can lead to new types of behaviors such as dynamic instabilities of the steady states and oscillatory motion.
D1-967	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves captivated by the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, holds the key to our very existence. Each strand, like a coded sequence, carries the genetic instructions necessary for an organism's development and function. Mutations, minor alterations in this sequence, can lead to diverse outcomes, from harmless characteristics to life-altering diseases. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insights into our evolution, health, and the intricate web of life itself. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of DNA, we open doors to potential cures for genetic disorders, and a deeper understanding of the intricate dance of life.
D1-968	The influence of time-dependent fitnesses on the infinite population dynamics of simple genetic algorithms (without crossover) is analyzed. Based on general arguments, a schematic phase diagram is constructed that allows one to characterize the asymptotic states in dependence on the mutation rate and the time scale of changes. Furthermore, the notion of regular changes is raised for which the population can be shown to converge towards a generalized quasispecies. Based on this, error thresholds and an optimal mutation rate are approximately calculated for a generational genetic algorithm with a moving needle-in-the-haystack landscape. The so found phase diagram is fully consistent with our general considerations.
D1-969	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Genes, composed of DNA, carry the instructions that dictate an organism's traits. They are the blueprints for life, encoding proteins that perform various cellular functions. Each gene is located on a specific chromosome, with humans having approximately 20,000 genes spread across 23 pairs of chromosomes. Mutations, alterations in the gene sequence, can lead to inherited disorders or genetic diversity. Understanding genes and their interactions is crucial in unraveling the mysteries of life, from the development of complex organisms to the origin of diseases.
D1-970	We study counter expressed gene networks constructed from gene-expression data obtained from many types of cancers. The networks are synthesized by connecting vertices belonging to each others' list of K-farthest-neighbors, with K being an a priori selected non-negative integer. In the range of K corresponding to minimum homogeneity, the degree distribution of the networks shows scaling. Clustering in these networks is smaller than that in equivalent random graphs and remains zero till significantly large K. Their small diameter, however, implies small-world behavior which is corroborated by their eigenspectrum. We discuss implications of these findings in several contexts.
D1-971	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. These sequences of DNA, nestled within chromosomes, encode the instructions for proteins, the building blocks of life. Genes, passed down from parents to offspring, dictate an organism's traits, from eye color to height. However, genes are not static. they can be influenced by environmental factors, a concept known as epigenetics. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment shapes the diversity of life forms on Earth, a testament to the complex, ever-evolving dance of biology.
D1-972	We have performed a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of operons in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli. The analysis reveals that operons that regulate each other and operons that are coregulated tend to lie next to each other on the genome. Moreover, these pairs of operons tend to be transcribed in diverging directions. This spatial arrangement of operons allows the upstream regulatory regions to interfere with each other. This affords additional regulatory control, as illustrated by a mean-field analysis of a feed-forward loop. Our results suggest that regulatory control can provide a selection pressure that drives operons together in the course of evolution.
D1-973	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a pivotal player in the dance of life is the gene. These segments of DNA carry the blueprint for every living organism, a complex code that dictates traits and characteristics. Each gene is a piece of a larger puzzle, working in harmony with myriad others to construct an organism's unique identity. The study of genetics, therefore, offers a fascinating lens through which to explore the mysteries of life, shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms that govern evolution, development, and the intricate interplay between environment and heredity. It's an ever-evolving field, with ongoing discoveries revealing the boundless complexity of life and the endless possibilities of our genetic inheritance.
D1-974	Biological phenomena differ significantly from physical phenomena. At the heart of this distinction is the fact that biological entities have computational abilities and thus they are inherently difficult to predict. This is the reason why simplified models that provide the minimal requirements for computation turn out to be very useful to study networks of many components. In this chapter, we briefly review the dynamical aspects of models of regulatory networks, discussing their most salient features, and we also show how these models can give clues about the way in which networks may organize their capacity to evolve, by providing simple examples of the implementation of robustness and modularity.
D1-975	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we find DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. This double-helix structure carries all instructions needed for an organism's growth and development. Genes, segments of DNA, determine our physical traits, such as eye color and height, and influence behavioral characteristics. Genetic variations, minor differences between individual DNA sequences, drive evolution, allowing species to adapt to changing environments. Modern technology, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9, are revolutionizing our understanding and manipulation of DNA, potentially paving the way for new medical treatments and eradicating genetic diseases. This exploration of genetics not only unveils the mysteries of life but also promises a future where we can master our own genetic destiny.
D1-976	The effect of small-amplitude noise on excitable systems with large time-scale separation is analyzed. It is found that small random perturbations of the fast excitatory variable result in the onset of a quasi-deterministic limit cycle behavior, absent without noise. The limit cycle is established at a critical value of the amplitude of the noise, and its period is nontrivially determined by the relationship between the noise amplitude and the time scale ratio. It is argued that this effect might provide a mechanism by which the function of biological systems operating in noisy environments can be robustly controlled by the level of the noise.
D1-977	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we unravel the mysteries concealed within DNA's double helix. The building blocks, nucleotides, consist of a sugar, phosphate, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases form the crucial pairs that hold the structure together. The sequence of these nucleotides, a unique code for each organism, dictates the proteins produced and ultimately, our physical and biological traits. Genetic engineering, a growing field, manipulates this code to alter traits or create novel ones, impacting everything from agriculture to medicine, and reshaping the way we perceive and interact with life.
D1-978	"The rapidly developing theory of complex networks indicates that real networks are not random, but have a highly robust large-scale architecture, governed by strict organizational principles. Here, we focus on the properties of biological networks, discussing their scale-free and hierarchical features. We illustrate the major network characteristics using examples from the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. We also discuss the principles of network utilization, acknowledging that the interactions in a real network have unequal strengths. We study the interplay between topology and reaction fluxes provided by flux-balance analysis. We find that the cellular utilization of the metabolic network is both globally and locally highly inhomogeneous, dominated by ""hot-spots"", representing connected high-flux pathways."
D1-979	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, a symphony of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, algae, and some bacteria, orchestrates this process. Through its photoreceptors, the green world absorbs sunlight, converting it into chemical energy. This energy, in turn, splits water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, a vital component for respiration. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide is assimilated, transforming it into glucose - the body's primary fuel. This miraculous process, spanning millions of years of evolution, sustains the biosphere, weaving the very fabric of life on Earth.
D1-980	The stability and conservation properties of a recently proposed polymerization model are studied. The achiral (racemic) solution is linearly unstable once the relevant control parameter (here the fidelity of the catalyst) exceeds a critical value. The growth rate is calculated for different fidelity parameters and cross-inhibition rates. A chirality parameter is defined and shown to be conserved by the nonlinear terms of the model. Finally, a truncated version of the model is used to derive a set of two ordinary differential equations and it is argued that these equations are more realistic than those used in earlier models of that form.
D1-981	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a fundamental process, binds the earth, air, and water. This biochemical reaction, carried out by green plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This photosynthetic dance sustains nearly all life on Earth, for it generates the oxygen we breathe while providing the energy plants need to grow and reproduce. Concurrently, photosynthesis absorbs excess carbon dioxide, helping mitigate its impact on climate change. This symphony of life, a testament to evolution's ingenious designs, continues to drive the resilience and diversity of our planet's ecosystems.
D1-982	We present a method to quantify spatial fluctuations of the substitution rate on different length scales throughout genomes of eukaryotes. The fluctuations on large length scales are found to be predominantly a consequence of a coarse-graining effect of fluctuations on shorter length scales. This is verified for both the mouse and the human genome. We also found that both species show similar standard deviation of fluctuations even though their mean substitution rate differs by a factor of two. Our method furthermore allows to determine time-resolved substitution rate maps from which we can compute auto-correlation functions in order to quantify how fast the spatial fluctuations in substitution rate change in time.
D1-983	 In the vibrant world of biology, symbiosis, a close and often long-term interaction between different biological organisms, captivates scientists. This relationship can be mutually beneficial, harmful, or neutral to the species involved. An intriguing example is the partnership between corals and photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. Corals provide the algae with a protected environment and nutrients, while the algae, through photosynthesis, generate food and oxygen for the coral. This symbiotic relationship contributes significantly to the formation of coral reefs, the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. However, changes in temperature and light can disrupt this delicate balance, leading to coral bleaching, a phenomenon that threatens these vital habitats. Thus, understanding symbiosis is crucial to safeguarding biodiversity and maintaining a healthy planet.
D1-984	A previously proved theorem gives sufficient conditions for an estimator of the false discovery rate (FDR) to conservatively converge to the FDR with probability 1 as the number of hypothesis tests increases, even for small sample sizes. It does not follow that several thousand tests ensure that the estimator has moderate variance under those conditions. In fact, they can hold even if the test statistics have long-range correlations, which yield unacceptably wide confidence intervals, as observed in genomic data when there are 8 or 16 individuals (microarrays) per group. Thus, informative FDR estimation will include some measure of its reliability.
D1-985	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we find ourselves intrigued by the concept of epigenetics. This field, akin to a silent symphony, orchestrates changes in organisms without altering the DNA sequence itself. Instead, it works by modifying how genes are read, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle. This dance of chemical tags on DNA and histone proteins, involving methyl, acetyl, and other groups, subtly alters gene activity, shaping an organism's development and health. Epigenetics, therefore, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering insight into how our experiences and environment can shape our genetic destiny, transcending the static view of DNA as our genetic blueprint.
D1-986	Evolutionary models measure the probability of amino acid substitutions occurring over different evolutionary distances. We examine various evolutionary models based on empirically derived amino acid substitution matrices. The models are constructed using the PAM and BLOSUM amino acid substitution matrices. We rescale these matrices by raising them to powers to model substitution patterns that account for different evolutionary distances. We also examine models that account for the dissimilarity of substitution rates along a protein sequence. We compare the models by computing the likelihood of each model across different alignments. We also present a specific example to illustrate the subtle differences in the estimation of evolutionary distance computed using the different models.
D1-987	 Exploring the intricate dance of life, we delve into the world of symbiosis, a fascinating biology phenomenon. Algae and coral, for example, form a mutually beneficial relationship, the former providing food through photosynthesis while the latter offers shelter and minerals. Bacteria within our gut play a crucial role in digestion, synthesizing essential nutrients from our diet. Similarly, mycorrhizal fungi team up with plant roots, enhancing their ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. These symbiotic relationships, woven throughout the biological realm, demonstrate the profound interconnectivity of life on Earth, underscoring the concept that we are all, in some way, interdependent.
D1-988	We describe the representation of the chemical affinity between the antigen-combining site of the immunoglobulin molecule and the antigen molecule as the probability of the two molecules existing in a bound state. Our model is based on the identification of shape attractors in the configuration space for the joint antibody / antigen combining site sequence. We parameterize configuration space in terms of Ramachandran angles. The shape attractors allow us to construct a Markov chain whose steady state distribution gives rise to the desired attachment probability. As a result we are able to delineate the enthalpic, entropic and kinetic components of affinity and study their interactions.
D1-989	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the fascinating DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix structure, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions essential for an organism's development and function. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring DNA's crucial role in our health. Genetic engineering, a tool harnessing this understanding, allows for targeted modifications of DNA, opening doors for potential medical breakthroughs and sustainable agriculture. As we continue to decipher the complex language of DNA, we stand on the precipice of a world where genetic information not only explains our past but also shapes our future.
D1-990	Reaction-diffusion equations based on a polymerization model are solved to simulate the spreading of hypothetic left and right handed life forms on the Earth's surface. The equations exhibit front-like behavior as is familiar from the theory of the spreading of epidemics. It is shown that the relevant time scale for achieving global homochirality is not, however, the time scale of front propagation, but the much longer global diffusion time. The process can be sped up by turbulence and large scale flows. It is speculated that, if the deep layers of the early ocean were sufficiently quiescent, there may have been the possibility of competing early life forms with opposite handedness.
D1-991	 In the fascinating world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often found in non-coding regions, can influence predispositions to diseases, drug responses, and even behavioral patterns. For instance, a specific SNP might increase the risk of diabetes, another could determine the effectiveness of a certain drug, and yet another might affect learning abilities. The implications of these SNPs are vast, offering invaluable insights into human health and evolving our understanding of genetic determinants. As research progresses, the role of these genetic markers in shaping our biology will continue to unravel, opening doors to tailored treatments and personalized healthcare.
D1-992	Naturally occurring networks exhibit quantitative features revealing underlying growth mechanisms. Numerous network mechanisms have recently been proposed to reproduce specific properties such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients. We present a method for inferring the mechanism most accurately capturing a given network topology, exploiting discriminative tools from machine learning. The Drosophila melanogaster protein network is confidently and robustly (to noise and training data subsampling) classified as a duplication-mutation-complementation network over preferential attachment, small-world, and other duplication-mutation mechanisms. Systematic classification, rather than statistical study of specific properties, provides a discriminative approach to understand the design of complex networks.
D1-993	 Delving into the intricacies of genetics, we encounter the captivating world of DNA, the molecule of life. Each strand, a twisted ladder of nucleotides, harbors the blueprint for every living organism. Alter a single rung in this ladder, and the resulting changes ripple through the life cycle, a testament to the profound influence of our genetic code. Within this code lies the key to our physical traits, behaviors, and even susceptibility to diseases. The study of genetics offers a powerful lens to explore the mysteries of life and our place within the vast tapestry of evolution. Unraveling these genetic threads illuminates our past, informs our present, and promises to shape our future.
D1-994	Simple memorizing tasks have been chosen such as a binary code on a matrix. After the establishment of an appropriate protocol, the codified matrices were individually presented to 150 university students who had to memorize them. A computer simulation for a similar task is available which uses a perceptron on which an algorithm was implemented allowing for some degree of globality (technically referred to as entropic nonextensivity within a current generalization of the usual, Boltzmann-Gibbs, statistical mechanics). Our main observation is that, for the very specific learning task on which we focus here, humans perform similarly to slightly nonextensive perceptrons.
D1-995	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed primarily by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy through the synthesis of glucose. This process is facilitated by chlorophyll, a green pigment found within the chloroplasts of these organisms. Water and carbon dioxide are the essential raw materials, with oxygen being a byproduct. This vital cycle not only sustains the life of the photosynthesizing organisms but also supports the existence of countless others, as it serves as the primary source of oxygen in our atmosphere and the starting point of many food chains. The significance of photosynthesis in the intricate web of life is undeniable, as it is the foundation upon which the survival and diversity of life on Earth are built.
D1-996	An oscillation with a period of around 500 kb in guanine and cytosine content (GC%) is observed in the DNA sequence of human chromosome 21. This oscillation is localized in the rightmost one-eighth region of the chromosome, from 43.5 Mb to 46.5 Mb. Five cycles of oscillation are observed in this region with six GC-rich peaks and five GC-poor valleys. The GC-poor valleys comprise regions with low density of CpG islands and, alternating between the two DNA strands, low gene density regions. Consequently, the long-range oscillation of GC% result in spacing patterns of both CpG island density, and to a lesser extent, gene densities.
D1-997	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, the fundamental unit of heredity. Genes, composed of DNA, carry the instructions for an organism's development and function. Each gene, residing within chromosomes, is a blueprint for a specific protein. These proteins perform various tasks, such as catalyzing metabolic reactions or building cellular structures. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to changes in gene function, resulting in a myriad of effects on an organism's traits and health. Genetic research continues to unravel the mysteries of life, shedding light on inherited diseases, evolution, and the complex interplay between genes and environment.

Neural networks also help to predict human relations within a group.
D1-999	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, executed by green plants and photosynthetic organisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. This energy is then stored in the form of glucose, a type of sugar, through a sequence of events involving chlorophyll and water. Carbon dioxide, absorbed from the atmosphere, is the source of carbon for these sugars. Oxygen, a byproduct of this process, is released back into the environment, sustaining the balance of gases essential for aerobic life. Photosynthesis, therefore, not only fuels the growth of plants but also contributes significantly to global carbon cycling and the oxygen content of our atmosphere.
D1-1000	Finite size effects on the calorimetric cooperatity of the folding-unfolding transition in two-state proteins are considered using the Go lattice models with and without side chains. We show that for models without side chains a dimensionless measure of calorimetric cooperativity kappa2 defined as the ratio of the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy does not depend on the number of amino acids N. The average value of kappa2 is about 3/4 which is lower than the experimental value kappa2=1. For models with side chains kappa2 approaches unity as kappa2 \sim N^mu, where exponent mu=0.17. Above the critical chain length Nc =135 these models can mimic the truly all-or-non folding-unfolding transition.
