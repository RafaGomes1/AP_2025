D1-1	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating deviation from traditional DNA sequencing. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, dictate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These alterations can be influenced by various factors, including age, environmental conditions, and lifestyle choices. Epigenetics offers a new perspective on how traits can be passed down through generations, not solely through genetic code, but also through life experiences and the environment. This field is rapidly advancing our understanding of disease development, aging processes, and the implications of gene-environment interactions.
D1-2	"A dynamical mean-field theory is developed to analyze stochastic single-cell dynamics of gene expression. By explicitly taking account of nonequilibrium and nonadiabatic features of the DNA state fluctuation, two-time correlation functions and response functions of single-cell dynamics are derived. The method is applied to a self-regulating gene to predict a rich variety of dynamical phenomena such as anomalous increase of relaxation time and oscillatory decay of correlations. Effective ""temperature"" defined as the ratio of the correlation to the response in the protein number is small when the DNA state change is frequent, while it grows large when the DNA state change is infrequent, indicating the strong enhancement of noise in the latter case."
D1-3	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a pivotal player. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence, instead, regulates gene expression through chemical modifications. These modifications, like methyl groups or histone proteins, can influence whether a gene is active or inactive, thus shaping an organism's traits and behaviors. This field offers intriguing possibilities, as it suggests that environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and even emotions may have long-lasting effects on our genetic expression. Epigenetic changes might potentially explain the influences of nurture over nature, providing a bridge between behavior and genes. As research advances, the implications of epigenetics in diseases, aging, and even transgenerational inheritance are becoming increasingly evident, opening new avenues for preventive and therapeutic strategies.
D1-4	A mathematical model of infiltrative tumour growth taking into account cell proliferation, death and motility is considered. The model is formulated in terms of local cell density and nutrient (oxygen) concentration. In the model the rate of cell death depends on the local nutrient level. Thus heterogeneous nutrient distribution in tissue affects tumour structure and development. The existence of automodel solutions is demonstrated and their properties are investigated. The results are compared to the properties of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov and Fisher equations. Influence of the nutrient distribution on the autowave speed selection as well as on the relaxation to automodel solution is demonstrated. The model adequately describes the data, observed in experiments.
D1-5	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool, offering unprecedented precision in editing DNA. This molecular scissors, derived from bacteria, can target specific regions of a genome, enabling scientists to correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, or even eradicate harmful pathogens. The potential applications of CRISPR span vastly, with promise in treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even enhancing human health. However, the ethical implications of this powerful technology are complex, raising questions about gene editing in humans, the potential for designer babies, and the balance between scientific progress and moral responsibility. As we delve deeper into the genetic fabric of life, it becomes increasingly crucial to navigate these ethical quandaries with thoughtfulness and foresight.
D1-6	Lieberman and Melott built their recent arXiv preprint 0704.2896 on my published paper and (a preprint of) a subsequent comment by Liebermans associate Cornette. But had this group waited for the Cornette comment to actually appear in print together with the expected Reply, they would have learned that his comment exposes Cornettes confusion that likely was due to journal misprint of my figure. Thus 0704.2896 is baseless. Despite receiving the extended Reply with Errata, these authors still fail to recognize that detrending of paleontological records-which they erroneously promote as a must-is an arbitrary rather than a universal operation.
D1-7	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical marvel occurs in chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells, where carbon dioxide and water are transformed into glucose and oxygen. This conversion not only sustains the life of the plant but also provides the world with vital oxygen, ensuring the survival of countless organisms. Furthermore, the glucose produced fuels the plant, allowing it to grow and reproduce, forming the foundation of the food chain. Photosynthesis, thus, is a testament to nature's ingenuity and the intricate web of life on Earth.
D1-8	Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body - reciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero Reynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.
D1-9	 In the intricate world of cellular machinery, the ribosome stands as a vital player. This complex, granular organelle is responsible for protein synthesis, a fundamental biological process. Comprised of two subunits - the smaller 40S and larger 60S - ribosomes translate messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences into amino acid chains, thus forming proteins essential for life. Ribosomes are ubiquitous, present in all living cells, and adaptable to diverse environments, enabling growth, repair, and maintenance within organisms. Understanding ribosomes and their function provides insights into cellular processes, potential therapeutic targets, and the origins of life itself.
D1-10	Surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules with hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic character can be effectively used as therapeutic drug for combating chicken malaria in poultry industry. The amorphous nanosilica was developed by top-down approach using volcanic soil derived silica as source material. Amorphous silica has long been used as feed additive for poultry industry and considered to be safe for human consumption by WHO and USDA. The basic mechanism of action of these nanosilica molecules is mediated by the physical absorption of VLDL, serum triglycerides and other serum cholesterol components in the lipophilic nanopores of nanosilica. This reduces the supply of the host derived cholesterol, thus limiting the growth of the malarial parasite in vivo.
D1-11	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery is the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool in molecular biology. This versatile gene-editing technique, derived from bacteria, enables precise alteration of DNA sequences. By introducing specific guide RNAs, the Cas9 enzyme snips the targeted DNA strand, facilitating corrections or additions of genetic material. This technology holds immense potential for combating genetic diseases by correcting mutations, enhancing crop resilience, and even contributing to the development of new biofuels. However, ethical considerations and potential unintended consequences demand careful exploration before widespread application in humans. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, therefore, stands as a testament to human ingenuity and a reminder of our responsibility in shaping the future of life itself.
D1-12	The multiple worlds of genetically manipulated laboratory organisms such as transgenic mice or worms with certain gene mutations are somewhat reminiscent of parallel worlds in quantum mechanics. So are various models of aging tested in such organisms. In this context, the tumor suppressor p53 has been found to either accelerate or delay aging, the latter, for instance, in conjunction with ARF, another tumor suppressor, as shown very recently. To more easily determine which of these artificial settings comes closest to real life, I discuss here their features in the light of my protein structure-based insights that have led me to propose a physiological anti-aging role for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) over the past four years.
D1-13	 In the realm of microbiology, the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae, known as zooxanthellae, is a captivating example of mutualism. These microscopic algae reside within the coral tissue, photosynthesizing and producing glucose, glycerol, and other organic compounds. In return, the coral provides the algae with inorganic nutrients, carbon dioxide, and a protective home. This partnership allows for the growth of striking coral reefs, which serve as biodiversity hotspots and provide essential ecosystem services, such as food, shelter, and coastal protection. However, this delicate balance can be disrupted by environmental changes, such as ocean acidification and rising temperatures, leading to coral bleaching events and, potentially, the degradation of these vital ecosystems.
D1-14	By explicitly representing the reaction times of discrete chemical systems as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes, we develop a new adaptive tau-leaping procedure. The procedure developed is novel in that accuracy is guaranteed by performing postleap checks. Because the representation we use separates the randomness of the model from the state of the system, we are able to perform the postleap checks in such a way that the statistics of the sample paths generated will not be biased by the rejections of leaps. Further, since any leap condition is ensured with a probability of one, the simulation method naturally avoids negative population values
D1-15	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a transformative force. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence itself, instead, modifies how genes are read and expressed, often in response to environmental factors. This dynamic process can influence traits such as growth, behavior, and disease susceptibility. For instance, early life experiences, diet, and stress can induce epigenetic changes, potentially altering gene expression patterns across generations. This profound interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems, challenging our understanding of heredity and paving the way for innovative approaches in medicine and conservation.
D1-16	We present a mathematical model of glucose-lactose diauxic growth in Escherichia coli including both the postive and negative regulation mechanisms of the lactose operon as well as the inducer exclusion. To validate this model, we first calculated the time evolution of beta-galactosidase for only the lactose nutrient and compared the numerical results with experimental data. Second, we compared the calculated cell biomass of the glucose-lactose diauxic growth with the experimental optical density of the diauxic growth for a particular E. coli MG 1655. For both cases, the numerical calculations from this model are in good agreement with these two experiments' data. The diauxic growth pattern of a wild type E. coli was also investigated.
D1-17	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has gained significant attention. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these modifications are chemical tags added to the DNA or histone proteins, which influence how genes are read and translated. These tags can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, and behavior, making epigenetics a fascinating study of nature and nurture interplay. Epigenetic changes can be temporary or permanent, and they may contribute to health and disease, as well as responses to treatments like chemotherapy. This dynamic field continues to unveil intricate layers of genetic regulation, offering promising avenues for personalized medicine and a deeper understanding of biological processes.
D1-18	Cells continuously probe their environment with membrane receptors, achieving subsecond adaptation of their behaviour [1-3]. Recently, several receptors, including cadherins, were found to bind ligands with a lifetime of order of one second. Here we show at the single molecule level that homotypic C-cadherin association involves transient intermediates lasting less than a few tens of milliseconds. Further, these intermediates transitionned towards more stable states with a kinetic rate displaying exponential decrease with piconewton forces. These features enable cells to detect ligands or measure surrounding mechanical behaviour within a fraction of a second, much more rapidly than was previously thought.
D1-19	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, a mesmerizing cephalopod, exhibits an otherworldly spectacle. As night falls, these deep-sea dwellers emit a soft, ethereal glow, a defense mechanism against predators. This luminescence is produced by a chemical reaction within specialized light-producing cells known as photophores. The unique pattern of light they create serves not only as camouflage but also allows them to communicate with others of their kind. Their astonishing ability to manipulate light, coupled with their intelligence and adaptability, makes bioluminescent squids a fascinating subject for scientific exploration and a testament to the wonders of the deep sea.
D1-20	Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is at present not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation time scales.
D1-21	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 stands as a revolutionary tool, offering the potential to precisely edit DNA sequences within an organism. This groundbreaking technology, derived from bacterial immune systems, can correct genetic mutations, eradicate harmful pathogens, and even enhance crop yield in agriculture. By harnessing this power, scientists can potentially eradicate genetic diseases, develop more resilient crops, and pave the way for a healthier, more sustainable future. The ethical implications are vast, requiring careful consideration as we navigate the once unimaginable ability to manipulate the very building blocks of life.
D1-22	The bacterium E. coli maneuvers itself to regions with high chemoattractant concentrations by performing two stereotypical moves: `runs', in which it moves in near straight lines, and `tumbles', in which it does not advance but changes direction randomly. The duration of each move is stochastic and depends upon the chemoattractant concentration experienced in the recent past. We relate this stochastic behavior to the steady-state density of a bacterium population, and we derive the latter as a function of chemoattractant concentration. In contrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of temporal correlations and variable tumbling durations. A range of behaviors obtains, that depends subtly upon several aspects of the system - memory, correlation, and tumbling stochasticity in particular.
D1-23	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) holds immense significance. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found at specific locations, can influence a wide array of traits, from eye color to susceptibility to diseases. SNPs create genetic diversity among individuals, contributing to the survival and evolution of species. They can also be linked to drug responses, making personalized medicine a promising avenue for healthcare advancement. In the ever-expanding field of genetics, the exploration and understanding of SNPs remain a captivating pursuit for scientists worldwide.
D1-24	Based upon the membrane currents generated by an action potential in a biologically realistic model of a pyramidal, hippocampal cell within rat CA1, we perform a moment expansion of the extracellular field potential. We decompose the potential into both inverse and classical moments and show that this method is a rapid and efficient way to calculate the extracellular field both near and far from the cell body. The action potential gives rise to a large quadrupole moment that contributes to the extracellular field up to distances of almost 1 cm. This method will serve as a starting point in connecting the microscopic generation of electric fields at the level of neurons to macroscopic observables such as the local field potential.
D1-25	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining the planet's ecosystems. This biological marvel, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process fuels the energy needs of organisms while replenishing the Earth's atmosphere with life-sustaining oxygen. Photosynthesis not only supports the survival of living beings but also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, helping to mitigate climate change by absorbing excess carbon dioxide. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and life on Earth underscores the interconnectedness of all living organisms and the delicate balance that maintains our planet's health.
D1-26	Using multicanonical simulations, the authors study the effect of charged end groups on helix formation in alanine based polypeptides. They confirm earlier reports that neutral polyalanine exhibits a pronounced helix-coil transition in gas phase simulations. Introducing a charged Lys+ at the C terminal stabilizes the helix and leads to a higher transition temperature. On the other hand, adding the Lys+ at the N terminal inhibits helix formation. Instead, a more globular structure was found. These results are in agreement with recent experiments on alanine based polypeptides in gas phase. They indicate that present force fields describe accurately the intramolecular interactions in proteins.
D1-27	 In marine ecosystems, the delicate balance between predator and prey is intricately woven. The humble krill, abundant in Antarctic waters, serves as a primary food source for whales, seals, and penguins. Yet, these tiny crustaceans are not only consumed. they are also vital in oxygen production. Krill feed on phytoplankton, consuming about 4% of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis each day. In doing so, they contribute significantly to the carbon cycle, helping to regulate climate change. Furthermore, their excretions enrich the ocean with nutrients, fostering further phytoplankton growth. Thus, the seemingly insignificant krill plays a crucial role in the health and sustainability of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, linking the realms of food webs, carbon cycles, and climate change.
D1-28	The precision of biochemical signaling is limited by randomness in the diffusive arrival of molecules at their targets. For proteins binding to the specific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription, the ability of the proteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA, in addition to their diffusion in bulk solution, would seem to generate a larger target for DNA binding, consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the regulatory site. Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the enhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion. With realistic parameters, sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical limits to the precision of transcriptional regulation.
D1-29	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics unfolds a new dimension. Unlike DNA sequence changes, epigenetic modifications influence gene expression without altering the actual genetic code. These changes can be caused by various factors, such as age, environment, and lifestyle, and are often reversible. For instance, the process of methylation, where a methyl group is added to DNA, can silence a gene, while demethylation can reactivate it. This dynamic interplay between DNA and its modifications offers fascinating insights into cellular processes, development, and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Epigenetics, thus, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, providing a compelling narrative for the intricate dance of life.
D1-30	"We consider words as a network of interacting letters, and approximate the probability distribution of states taken on by this network. Despite the intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial (and arbitrary), we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the full statistics of four letter words, capturing ~92% of the multi-information among letters and even ""discovering"" real words that were not represented in the data from which the pairwise correlations were estimated. The maximum entropy model defines an energy landscape on the space of possible words, and local minima in this landscape account for nearly two-thirds of words used in written English."
D1-31	 In the vibrant realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool, is transforming scientific research. This innovative technology, derived from bacteria, allows precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing the power of guide RNAs that target specific gene regions, scientists can delete, alter, or correct mutations, opening avenues for curing genetic diseases and improving crop yield. This breakthrough in gene editing has the potential to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, and even conservation efforts, offering a beacon of hope in the ongoing battle against genetic disorders and genetic extinction. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a testament to nature's resilience, is a shining example of our ability to adapt and innovate, empowering us to sculpt the very essence of life.
D1-32	Using a combination of theory and computer simulations, we study the translocation of an RNA molecule, pulled through a solid-state nanopore by an optical tweezer, as a method to determine its secondary structure. The resolution with which the elements of the secondary structure can be determined is limited by thermal fluctuations. We present a detailed study of these thermal fluctuations, including the frequency spectrum, and show that these rule out single-nucleotide resolution under the experimental conditions which we simulated. Two possible ways to improve this resolution are strong stretching of the RNA with a back-pulling voltage across the membrane, and stiffening of the translocated part of the RNA by biochemical means.
D1-33	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics is gaining significant attention. It delves into changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these modifications are achieved through chemical tags, such as methyl groups, that alter the structure of DNA, turning genes 'on' or 'off'. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, and they can even be heritable, offering insights into the complex interplay between nature and nurture. This field holds immense potential for furthering our understanding of diseases, aging, and hereditary traits, potentially paving the way for new therapeutic interventions.
D1-34	The equilibrium statistical properties of DNA denaturation bubbles are examined in detail within the framework of the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. Bubble formation in homogeneous DNA is found to depend crucially on the presence of nonlinear base-stacking interactions. Small bubbles extending over less than 10 base pairs are associated with much larger free energies of formation per site than larger bubbles. As the critical temperature is approached, the free energy associated with further bubble growth becomes vanishingly small. An analysis of average displacement profiles of bubbles of varying sizes at different temperatures reveals almost identical scaled shapes in the absence of nonlinear stacking. nonlinear stacking leads to distinct scaled shapes of large and small bubbles.
D1-35	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized biology, offering a precision unparalleled in manipulating DNA. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immunity, enables targeted modifications, deletions, and corrections of genetic defects, offering potential cures for genetic disorders. Beyond medicine, CRISPR can aid in crop improvement, combating hunger and poverty, and even revitalizing endangered species by reintroducing lost genetic diversity. This technology, however, also raises ethical questions about gene editing in humans, necessitating prudent regulation and public discourse. As research progresses, the implications of CRISPR-Cas9 in shaping the future of biological science are vast and profound, promising solutions to pressing global challenges while demanding careful consideration of societal and ethical implications.
D1-36	In recent work we presented a new approach to the analysis of weighted networks, by providing a straightforward generalization of any network measure defined on unweighted networks. This approach is based on the translation of a weighted network into an ensemble of edges, and is particularly suited to the analysis of fully connected weighted networks. Here we apply our method to several such networks including distance matrices, and show that the clustering coefficient, constructed by using the ensemble approach, provides meaningful insights into the systems studied. In the particular case of two data sets from microarray experiments the clustering coefficient identifies a number of biologically significant genes, outperforming existing identification approaches.
D1-37	 In marine ecosystems, the symbiotic relationship between sea anemones and anemonefish is a captivating spectacle. Anemonefish, with their vibrant hues, find protection within the anemone's tentacles, camouflaging themselves effectively against predators. In return, the anemone benefits from the anemonefish's waste, which serves as a nutrient source. This mutualistic bond is a testament to the intricate balance and cooperation that exists within the diverse realm of marine life. The anemonefish's ability to withstand the anemone's nematocysts, the stinging cells on the tentacles, is a result of a gradual immunity built over time, further emphasizing the deep-rooted harmony of this symbiosis.
D1-38	As shown by Ganan-Calvo and co-workers, a free liquid jet can be compressed in iameter through gas-dynamic forces exerted by a co-flowing gas, obviating the need for a solid nozzle to form a microscopic liquid jet and thereby alleviating the clogging problems that plague conventional droplet sources of small diameter. We describe in this paper a novel form of droplet beam source based on this principle. The source is miniature, robust, dependable, easily fabricated, and eminently suitable for delivery of microscopic liquid droplets, including hydrated biological samples, into vacuum for analysis using vacuum instrumentation. Monodisperse, single file droplet streams are generated by triggering the device with a piezoelectric actuator. The device is essentially immune to clogging.
D1-39	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid, a nocturnal cephalopod, plays a captivating role. These creatures emit a soft, blue-green glow, a result of a chemical reaction within their light organs. This light serves multiple purposes: camouflage, communication, and even deception. During daylight, squids blend into the surrounding environment, relying on their gelatinous skin for protection. At night, they use bioluminescence to avoid predators or attract prey. Intriguingly, some squids can manipulate their light patterns, mimicking the behavior of other marine creatures to deceive predators or lure unsuspecting prey. The bioluminescent squid, with its mesmerizing displays, continues to fascinate scientists and laypeople alike, offering insights into the intricate world of marine life.
D1-40	When moving from native to light activated bacteriorhodopsin, modification of charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the presence of light.
D1-41	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter the genetic code, potentially influencing traits and susceptibility to diseases. These minute variations, often found in non-coding regions, can have profound effects on gene expression, sometimes acting as molecular switches that control the activity of genes. The study of SNPs has revolutionized our understanding of hereditary traits, providing insights into the complex interplay between genes and environment. This knowledge offers promising avenues for personalized medicine, as it allows for the development of treatments tailored to an individual's unique genetic profile.
D1-42	The effect of disorder in the energetic heights and in the physical locations of fence barriers encountered by transmembrane molecules such as proteins and lipids in their motion in cell membranes is studied theoretically. The investigation takes as its starting point a recent analysis of a periodic system with constant distances between barriers and constant values of barrier heights, and employs effective medium theory to treat the disorder. The calculations make possible, in principle, the extraction of confinement parameters such as mean compartment sizes and mean intercompartmental transition rates from experimentally reported published observations. The analysis should be helpful both as an unusual application of effective medium theory and as an investigation of observed molecular movements in cell membranes.
D1-43	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 stands as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacteria, allows for precise editing of DNA sequences, opening doors to countless possibilities. It can correct genetic mutations responsible for diseases, enhance crop resilience, and even modify the traits of organisms, such as livestock, for improved food production. Yet, the ethical implications are vast and complex, necessitating careful consideration. Balancing the potential benefits against the risks, including unintended consequences and the possibility of genetic manipulation being misused, is crucial in shaping the future of this technology. As we venture into this brave new world, it is paramount that we proceed with caution, guided by a deep respect for life and a commitment to the equitable distribution of its benefits.
D1-44	To achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, a swimmer must deform in a way that is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry. this result is known as the scallop theorem. We show here that there is no many-scallop theorem. We demonstrate that two active particles undergoing reciprocal deformations can swim collectively. moreover, polar particles also experience effective long-range interactions. These results are derived for a minimal dimers model, and generalized to more complex geometries on the basis of symmetry and scaling arguments. We explain how such cooperative locomotion can be realized experimentally by shaking a collection of soft particles with a homogeneous external field.
D1-45	 In the intricate realm of marine life, the bioluminescent jellyfish stands out as a captivating spectacle. These ethereal creatures possess light-emitting organs called photophores, which produce a glow through a chemical reaction. As they sway in the dark waters, their pulsating lights create mesmerizing patterns, attracting prey and deterring predators. The cause behind this enchanting display is a protein called green fluorescent protein (GFP), discovered in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, that utilizes calcium ions to emit a bright green light. This underwater dance of light is not merely aesthetic. it serves as a prime example of nature's intricate ballet, where survival and beauty are intimately intertwined.
D1-46	The conformation of circular DNA molecules of various lengths adsorbed in a 2D conformation on a mica surface is studied. The results confirm the conjecture that the critical exponent $\nu$ is topologically invariant and equal to the SAW value (in the present case $\nu=3/4$), and that the topology and dimensionality of the system strongly influences the cross-over between the rigid regime and the self-avoiding regime at a scale $L\approx 8 \ell_p$. Additionally, the bond correlation function scales with the molecular length $L$ as predicted. For molecular lengths $L\leq5 \ell_p$, circular DNA behaves like a stiff molecule with approximately elliptic shape.
D1-47	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining life on Earth. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen in a biochemical reaction. This process, occurring in the chloroplasts, is a testament to nature's ingenuity, providing the planet with the essential oxygen we breathe while generating food for both plants and organisms higher up the food chain. Photosynthesis, thus, plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of life on our planet.
D1-48	"The scale invariance of natural images suggests an analogy to the statistical mechanics of physical systems at a critical point. Here we examine the distribution of pixels in small image patches and show how to construct the corresponding thermodynamics. We find evidence for criticality in a diverging specific heat, which corresponds to large fluctuations in how ""surprising"" we find individual images, and in the quantitative form of the entropy vs. energy. The energy landscape derived from our thermodynamic framework identifies special image configurations that have intrinsic error correcting properties, and neurons which could detect these features have a strong resemblance to the cells found in primary visual cortex."
D1-49	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool, offers unprecedented precision in editing DNA. This gene-editing technology, derived from bacterial immune defenses, allows scientists to correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, or even disable harmful genes. It has profound implications for medicine, agriculture, and conservation, as it paves the way for potential cures for genetic diseases, crop improvement, and the preservation of endangered species. However, the ethical implications are vast, necessitating careful consideration and regulation to ensure its benefits are maximized while minimizing potential risks to humanity and the environment.
D1-50	Spiral wave propagation in period-2 excitable media is often accompanied by line-defects, the locus of points with period-1 oscillations. Here we investigate spiral line-defects in cardiac tissue where period-2 behavior has a known arrhythmogenic role. We find that the number of line defects, which is constrained to be an odd integer, is three for a freely rotating spiral, with and without meander, but one for a spiral anchored around a fixed heterogeneity. We interpret analytically this finding using a simple theory where spiral wave unstable modes with different numbers of line-defects correspond to quantized solutions of a Helmholtz equation. Furthermore, the slow inward rotation of spiral line-defects is described in different regimes.
D1-51	 In the captivating realm of marine biology, the giant squid (Architeuthis dux) reigns supreme. This enigmatic creature, with eyes the size of dinner plates, dwells in the deep, dark abyss of the ocean. Reaching lengths up to 43 feet, it boasts the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, adapted to the pitch-black depths it inhabits. Equipped with eight arms and two longer feeding tentacles, it preys upon deep-sea creatures such as fish and other cephalopods. Despite its size, our knowledge of the giant squid remains limited, as it eludes scientists, making it an enduring symbol of the ocean's mysteries.
D1-52	"Self-arrangement of individuals into spatial patterns often accompanies and promotes species diversity in ecological systems. Here, we investigate pattern formation arising from cyclic dominance of three species, operating near a bifurcation point. In its vicinity, an Eckhaus instability occurs, leading to convectively unstable ""blurred"" patterns. At the bifurcation point, stochastic effects dominate and induce counterintuitive effects on diversity: Large patterns, emerging for medium values of individuals' mobility, lead to rapid species extinction, while small patterns (low mobility) promote diversity, and high mobilities render spatial structures irrelevant. We provide a quantitative analysis of these phenomena, employing a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation."
D1-53	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis serves as the pulsating heart of our planet. This biochemical process, performed by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen generated, essential for respiration, is released into the atmosphere, supporting the survival of numerous organisms, including humans. Meanwhile, the glucose, a primary source of energy, fuels plant growth and development, ultimately forming the foundation of the food chain. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and life on Earth highlights the intricate balance sustaining our world.
D1-54	Myosin V was the first discovered processive motor from the myosin family. It has therefore been subject of a number of mechanical, kinetic, optical and structural studies and now belongs to the best characterised motor proteins. This effort has been accompanied by a number of different theoretical models. In this article we give an overview of them and discuss what they have in common and where the open questions are. The latter include the existence of sub-steps, the process that limits the run length, the nature of backward steps, the flexibility of the lever arm and the state of the lead head.
D1-55	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid is a captivating creature that illuminates the deep-sea abyss. These cephalopods produce light through a chemical reaction in specialized cells called photophores, which are strategically placed throughout their bodies. This light serves multiple purposes, from communication and camouflage to luring prey or deterring predators. The mechanism of bioluminescence involves a luciferin-luciferase reaction, where oxygen triggers the emission of blue light. Some squid can change the color and intensity of their light, a trait thought to be crucial for their survival in the diverse and dynamic deep-sea environment. The beauty and mystery of bioluminescent squids continue to inspire awe and scientific exploration.
D1-56	We propose a model of evolutionary snowdrift game with $N$-person interactions and study the effects of multi-person interactions on the emergence of cooperation. An exact $N$-th-order equation for the equilibrium density of cooperators $x^*$ is derived for a well-mixed population using the approach of replicator dynamics. The results show that the extent of cooperation drops with increasing cost-to-benefit ratio and the number $N$ of interaction persons in a group, with $x^{*}\sim1/N$ for large $N$. An algorithm for numerical simulations is constructed for the model. The simulation results are in good agreements with theoretical results of the replicator dynamics.
D1-57	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating development unfolds: CRISPR-Cas9. This revolutionary tool, hailed as a molecular scissor, offers an unprecedented ability to edit DNA accurately and precisely. By incorporating customized guide RNAs, scientists can direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific genomic locations, effectively snipping unwanted genetic sequences. This technology opens a myriad of possibilities, from eradicating genetic diseases, enhancing crop yields, to even altering the fundamental traits of organisms. However, the ethical implications are complex, as tinkering with the blueprint of life raises questions about the boundaries of human intervention. As research progresses, the CRISPR-Cas9 system promises a future where we can sculpt life itself, a power that comes with a profound responsibility.
D1-58	We discuss the possibility of multiple underlying etiologies of the condition currently labeled as schizophrenia. We support this hypothesis with a theoretical model of the prefrontal-limbic system. We show how the dynamical behavior of this model depends on an entire set of physiological parameters, representing synaptic strengths, vulnerability to stress-induced cortisol, dopamine regulation and rates of autoantibody production. Malfunction of different such parameters produces similar outward dysregulation of the system, which may readily lead to diagnosis difficulties in a clinician's office. We further place this paradigm within the contexts of pathophysiology and of antipsychotic pharmacology. We finally propose brain profiling as the future quantitative diagnostic toolbox that agrees with a multiple etiologies hypothesis of schizophrenia.
D1-59	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the lifeblood of our planet. It's a dance between sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, choreographed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria. These solar-powered organelles, called chloroplasts, convert light energy into chemical energy, synthesizing glucose and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symphony of reactions supports almost all life on Earth, from the mightiest redwood to the tiniest phytoplankton, and even extends to the air we breathe, underscoring photosynthesis's indispensable role in maintaining our planet's balance.
D1-60	We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100 random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted- interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results.
D1-61	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating concept emerges: epigenetics. It's the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. For instance, the food we eat, stress levels, and even our sleep patterns can impact epigenetic changes, potentially shaping our health and disease risk over time. This dynamic interplay between genes, environment, and lifestyle underscores the complexity of biological systems and offers new avenues for understanding, preventing, and treating diseases.
D1-62	Isolated human buccal epithelium cell were irradiated by microwaves at frequency f=35 GHz and surface power density E=30 mcW/cm2. The state of chromatin in human cells was determined by methodsof light and electron microscopy. The state of cell membranes was evaluated by the method of vital indigo carmine staining. The microwave-induced condensation of chromatin in human cells was revealed. Left side circulary polarized waves induced less effect than linearly polarized radiation. The linearly polarized electromagnetic waves induced cell membrane damage revealed by the increase of cell stainability. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the mechanisms of biologica effect of electromagnetic waves.
D1-63	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, serving as the earth's primary energy source. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Photosynthesis not only sustains plant life but also oxygenates our atmosphere, a critical factor for the survival of most living organisms. This symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic organisms is essential for maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Moreover, photosynthesis serves as a vital link in the food chain, ultimately providing energy for every living organism on our planet.
D1-64	During fast locomotion - gallop, half bound - of quadruped mammals, the ground contact of the limbs in each pair do not alternate symmetrically. Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference. Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia, Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.
D1-65	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound effects. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at gene boundaries, can subtly alter protein structure and function. Consequently, SNPs play pivotal roles in determining individual traits, susceptibility to diseases, and response to medications. For instance, a SNP in the APOE gene is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's, while another in the CYP2D6 gene influences drug metabolism. These genetic variations, once understood, can unlock doors to personalized medicine, offering tailored treatments that maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Thus, the study of SNPs is not merely a curiosity. it is a key to unlocking the potential for precision healthcare.
D1-66	Main aim of this topical issue is to report recent advances in noisy nonequilibrium processes useful to describe the dynamics of ecological systems and to address the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in ecology both from the experimental and theoretical points of view. This is in order to understand the dynamical behaviour of ecological complex systems through the interplay between nonlinearity, noise, random and periodic environmental interactions. Discovering the microscopic rules and the local interactions which lead to the emergence of specific global patterns or global dynamical behaviour and the noises role in the nonlinear dynamics is an important, key aspect to understand and then to model ecological complex systems.
D1-67	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal process, sustaining life on Earth. This phenomenon, carried out primarily by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This conversion, facilitated by chlorophyll within the plant's cells, is the basis of our planet's oxygen supply, making it essential for the survival of virtually all aerobic organisms. Furthermore, the energy derived from photosynthesis is also harnessed by many organisms, forming the foundation of food chains and ecosystems. Thus, photosynthesis, though seemingly a simple process, plays an indispensable role in the intricate web of life on our planet.
D1-68	We propose a strange-attractor model of tumor growth and metastasis. It is a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal cancer model with strong nonlinear couplings. Even the same type of tumor is different in every patient both in size and appearance, as well as in temporal behavior. This is clearly a characteristic of dynamical systems sensitive to initial conditions. The new chaotic model of tumor growth and decay is biologically motivated. It has been developed as a live Mathematica demonstration, see Wolfram Demonstrator site: http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ChaoticAttractorInTumorGrowth/ Key words: Reaction-diffusion tumor growth model, chaotic attractor, sensitive dependence on initial tumor characteristics
D1-69	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteria, often maligned for their role in disease, exhibit an extraordinary diversity of functions. Some, like Nitrosomonas, convert ammonia into nitrite in aquatic systems, essential for the nitrogen cycle. Others, such as Rhizobium, form symbiotic relationships with plants, enhancing nutrient uptake and promoting growth. Streptococcus, a common resident of the human mouth and skin, can be beneficial, producing enzymes that aid in digestion, or harmful, causing infections if conditions become unfavorable. This variability underscores the intricate balance and complex roles bacteria play in our environment and within us.
D1-70	Eukaryotic cells possess a sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient toward sources of soluble chemicals. The extracellular chemical signal triggers separation of the cell membrane into two domains populated by different phospholipid molecules and oriented along the signal anisotropy. We propose a theory of this polarization process, which is articulated into subsequent stages of germ nucleation, patch coarsening and merging into a single domain. We find that the polarization time, $t_\epsilon$, depends on the anisotropy degree $\epsilon$ through the power law $t_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^{-2}$, and that in a cell of radius $R$ there should exist a threshold value $\epsilon_\mathrm{th}\propto R^{-1}$ for the smallest detectable anisotropy.
D1-71	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role in energy production. They generate ATP, the primary energy currency of cells, through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where a series of protein complexes collaborate to harness chemical energy from nutrients and convert it into electrical energy, ultimately driving ATP synthesis. Mitochondria's central role in energy metabolism makes them indispensable for virtually all cellular functions, imparting them a crucial position in the intricate dance of life at the cellular level.
D1-72	The existence of beyond mean field quasi-cycle oscillations in a simple spatial model of predator prey interactions is derived from a path integral formalism. The results agree substantially with those obtained from analysis of similar models using system size expansions of the master equation. In all of these analyses, the discrete nature of predator prey populations and finite size effects lead to persistent oscillations in time, but spatial patterns fail to form. The path integral formalism goes beyond mean field theory and provides a focus on individual realizations of the stochastic time evolution of population not captured in the standard master equation approach.
D1-73	" In the intricate realm of genetics, a single base pair mutation can often lead to significant phenotypic changes. This is apparent in sickle cell anemia, a hereditary disease primarily affecting red blood cells. The mutation in the beta-globin gene causes the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein, which gives these cells a crescent, or ""sickle,"" shape. This distortion impedes their flexibility, resulting in a propensity to clump together and obstruct blood vessels, leading to anemia, chronic pain, and potential organ damage. Understanding this mutation's consequences provides insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies."
D1-74	We propose a simple model of cytochrome c oxidase, including four redox centers and four protonable sites, to study the time evolution of electrostatically coupled electron and proton transfers initiated by the injection of a single electron into the enzyme. We derive a system of master equations for electron and proton state probabilities and show that an efficient pumping of protons across the membrane can be obtained for a reasonable set of parameters. All four experimentally observed kinetic phases appear naturally from our model. We also calculate the dependence of the pumping efficiency on the transmembrane voltage at different temperatures and discuss a possible mechanism of the redox-driven proton translocation.
D1-75	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system revolutionizes gene editing, offering unprecedented precision. Originating from bacteria as a defense mechanism against viruses, it has been repurposed to modify DNA sequences within a cell. This versatile tool, composed of a RNA-guided Cas9 enzyme, can accurately target and snip specific genes, paving the way for potential therapeutic applications and genetic research. From correcting genetic disorders to creating genetically modified organisms, the CRISPR-Cas9 system is transforming the landscape of biology, opening doors to a future where treating diseases and understanding genetic inheritance becomes more feasible than ever.
D1-76	The origin of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression has received considerable attention recently. Fluctuations in gene expression are particularly pronounced in cellular systems because of the small copy number of species undergoing transitions between discrete chemical states and the small size of biological compartments. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for gene expression regulation including several binding sites, considering elementary reactions only. The model is used to investigate the role of cooperativity on the intrinsic fluctuations of gene expression, by means of master equation formalism. We found that the Hill coefficient and the level of noise increases as the interaction energy between activators increases. Additionally, we show that the model allows to distinguish between two cooperative binding mechanisms.
D1-77	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a process performed by plants and some microorganisms, plays a pivotal role. By harnessing sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen, it sustains life on Earth. This process not only fuels the growth of plants but also generates the oxygen we breathe, making it a cornerstone of our existence. Furthermore, photosynthesis serves as a vital part of the carbon cycle, helping to balance atmospheric carbon levels, thus influencing climate regulation. A delicate dance between light, water, and carbon dioxide, photosynthesis underscores the interconnectedness of life and our environment, reminding us of our dependency on the natural world.
D1-78	A new delay equation is introduced to describe the punctuated evolution of complex nonlinear systems. A detailed analytical and numerical investigation provides the classification of all possible types of solutions for the dynamics of a population in the four main regimes dominated respectively by: (i) gain and competition, (ii) gain and cooperation, (iii) loss and competition and (iv) loss and cooperation. Our delay equation may exhibit bistability in some parameter range, as well as a rich set of regimes, including monotonic decay to zero, smooth exponential growth, punctuated unlimited growth, punctuated growth or alternation to a stationary level, oscillatory approach to a stationary level, sustainable oscillations, finite-time singularities as well as finite-time death.
D1-79	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, specifically the Dinoflagellate symbionts within their light organs, exhibit a captivating spectacle of nature. These symbiotic relationships, where the squid hosts the microscopic, light-producing dinoflagellates, enable the squid to create dazzling flashes of light to evade predators, communicate, or attract prey. The glowing display is generated by a chemical reaction within the dinoflagellates, a symbiosis that benefits both organisms, showcasing the intricate balance and diversity within the vast, illuminated depths of the ocean.
D1-80	The relationship between a neuron's complex inputs and its spiking output defines the neuron's coding strategy. This is frequently and effectively modeled phenomenologically by one or more linear filters that extract the components of the stimulus that are relevant for triggering spikes, and a nonlinear function that relates stimulus to firing probability. In many sensory systems, these two components of the coding strategy are found to adapt to changes in the statistics of the inputs, in such a way as to improve information transmission. Here, we show for two simple neuron models how feature selectivity as captured by the spike-triggered average depends both on the parameters of the model and on the statistical characteristics of the input.
D1-81	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single base pair mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene triggers the onset of Cystic Fibrosis, a hereditary disease primarily affecting the respiratory and digestive systems. The mutated CFTR protein, instead of facilitating the transport of salt and water, forms a thick mucus that clogs the airways and obstructs vital organs, leading to persistent lung infections and poor nutrition. Despite advancements in treatment, understanding the complexities of this genetic mutation remains crucial in developing more targeted and effective therapies for those affected by this devastating disorder.
D1-82	We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA hairpins that fold/unfold under the action of applied mechanical force. We introduce the concept of the molecular free energy landscape and derive simplified expressions for the force dependent Kramers-Bell rates. To test the theory we have designed a specific DNA hairpin sequence that shows two-state cooperative folding under mechanical tension and carried out pulling experiments using optical tweezers. We show how we can determine the parameters that characterize the molecular free energy landscape of such sequence from rupture force kinetic studies. Finally we combine such kinetic studies with experimental investigations of the Crooks fluctuation relation to derive the free energy of formation of the hairpin at zero force.
D1-83	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a fascinating study, delving into DNA modifications that do not alter the sequence of the DNA itself. Instead, these changes influence gene expression, essentially determining whether a gene is 'on' or 'off'. Factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state can induce these modifications, offering insights into how external factors may impact biological function. Epigenetic changes are a dynamic interplay between DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, collectively shaping our genetic expression and, consequently, our health and well-being. This field holds immense potential in understanding complex traits and diseases, and may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in the future.
D1-84	We present a non-neutral stochastic model for the dynamics taking place in a meta-community ecosystems in presence of migration. The model provides a framework for describing the emergence of multiple ecological scenarios and behaves in two extreme limits either as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity or as the Bak-Sneppen model. Interestingly, the model shows a condensation phase transition where one species becomes the dominant one, the diversity in the ecosystems is strongly reduced and the ecosystem is non-stationary. This phase transition extend the principle of competitive exclusion to open ecosystems and might be relevant for the study of the impact of invasive species in native ecologies.
D1-85	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating offshoot. Epigenetics, unlike DNA sequencing, influences gene expression through chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins. These modifications, in turn, can alter the accessibility of genes, thereby regulating their activity. Environmental factors, behaviors, and even aging contribute to these alterations, providing a bridge between nature and nurture. Epigenetics offers a compelling avenue for exploring how experiences can shape an individual's biology, potentially even being passed down through generations. This field's profound implications for understanding disease, aging, and even the roots of behavioral traits are just beginning to unfold, promising a new era in our comprehension of life's complexities.
D1-86	Developmental transcriptional networks in plants and animals operate in both space and time. To understand these transcriptional networks it is essential to obtain whole-genome expression data at high spatiotemporal resolution. Substantial amounts of spatial and temporal microarray expression data previously have been obtained for the Arabidopsis root. however, these two dimensions of data have not been integrated thoroughly. Complicating this integration is the fact that these data are heterogeneous and incomplete, with observed expression levels representing complex spatial or temporal mixtures. Given these partial observations, we present a novel method for reconstructing integrated high resolution spatiotemporal data. Our method is based on a new iterative algorithm for finding approximate roots to systems of bilinear equations.
D1-87	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This symphony of chemical reactions sustains the planet's flora and fauna, providing the food and oxygen necessary for life. Moreover, photosynthesis serves as a natural carbon cycle, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. The efficiency and resilience of photosynthesis have inspired countless scientific inquiries, seeking to optimize this vital process in our ongoing quest for a sustainable future.
D1-88	Empirical observations suggest that in pure even-aged forests, the mean diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above ground) tends to remain a constant proportion of stand height (H, average height of the largest trees in a stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density (N, number of trees per hectare): D = beta (H-1.3)/Ln(N). Thinning causes a relatively small and temporary change in the slope beta, the magnitude and duration of which depends on the nature of the thinning. This relationship may provide a robust predictor of growth in situations where scarce data and resources preclude more sophisticated modelling approaches.
D1-89	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid, with its iridescent skin and dazzling light displays, captivates scientists and divers alike. These cephalopods use bioluminescence for a variety of purposes, including attracting prey, communicating with conspecifics, and evading predators. Interestingly, the light emitted by squids is not created in their bodies, but rather in specialized light-producing organs called photophores. These photophores contain luciferin, a chemical that reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase to produce light. By controlling the amount and timing of this reaction, squids can create a wide range of light patterns, adding another layer of complexity to their already fascinating behavior.
D1-90	"A model of pattern formation in living systems is presented. The pattern is achieved by the sequential interaction of two signaling pathways. The coupling of the pattern to the (thick) epithelial sheet changes is given, when the Gauss curvature'K'enters. The model suggests a novel point-like placement for organs such as eyes, antennae, limbs, and wings. In the case of plant patterns, 'leaf' outgrowths from a stem are predicted to be under the control of a yet to be discovered ""master regulatiory gene"", analogous to the animal case, when various outgrowths from the animal body are generally accompanied by activation of the 'distal-less' (Dll) gene."
D1-91	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteriophages, or phages, are fascinating entities. These are viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, offering a potential solution to antibiotic resistance. Phages, being highly specific to their host bacterium, can selectively destroy harmful pathogens, leaving beneficial bacteria unharmed. This targeted approach could mitigate the escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance, a global health threat. Research into phage therapy is progressing, with promising results in treating various bacterial infections. However, challenges remain, including understanding the long-term effects and ensuring consistent phage efficacy. The future of phage therapy holds immense promise, potentially revolutionizing the way we combat bacterial infections, preserving the efficacy of our dwindling antibiotics.
D1-92	When an infectious disease strikes a population, the number of newly reported cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early stages of the outbreak. An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, from the limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.
D1-93	 In the realm of marine biology, the octopus, a cephalopod, stands out for its extraordinary intelligence and adaptability. With a nervous system more complex than any other invertebrate, it exhibits problem-solving skills, camouflage, and even tool use. The octopus's color-changing skin allows it to blend seamlessly with its surroundings, aiding in hunting and evasion. Its ink sac, another defense mechanism, can be used to obscure its escape. The octopus's lifespan is relatively short, but its brief existence is filled with remarkable behaviors that continue to captivate scientists and observers alike.
D1-94	We calculate the optimality of a doublet precursor to the canonical genetic code with respect to mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the proposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code. Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.
D1-95	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a fascinating process. It is the method through which a cell duplicates its genetic material to ensure the accurate transmission of traits during cell division. This process involves the synthesis of a new DNA molecule from an existing one, ensuring the integrity of the genetic code. The enzyme helicase unwinds the double helix, while another enzyme, polymerase, adds nucleotides to create new strands that complement the original. This duplication ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic information from the parent cell, securing the continuity of life.
D1-96	Increasingly, biologists are constructing evolutionary trees on large numbers of overlapping sets of taxa, and then combining them into a `supertree' that classifies all the taxa. In this paper, we ask how much coverage of the total set of taxa is required by these subsets in order to ensure we have enough information to reconstruct the supertree uniquely. We describe two results - a combinatorial characterization of the covering subsets to ensure that at most one supertree can be constructed from the smaller trees (whatever trees these may be) and a more liberal analysis that asks only that the supertree is highly likely to be uniquely specified by the tree structure on the covering subsets.
D1-97	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a significant role. These stationary, tentacled organisms thrive in diverse habitats, from shallow coral reefs to deep-sea trenches. They are carnivorous, capturing prey with their stinging cells called nematocysts. But the sea anemone-clownfish symbiosis is particularly fascinating. Clownfish find refuge among anemone's tentacles, while deterring anemone-eating predators with their distinctive behavior. In return, the anemone benefits from the cleaner environment maintained by the clownfish, who remove parasites and other waste. This mutualistic relationship underscores the complex interconnectedness within marine ecosystems.
D1-98	We consider a model of bilayer lipid membrane with bola-lipids. The bola-lipid is modeled by linking tails of the hydrophobic chains in the opposite monolayers within bilayer as a first approximation. A number of thermodynamical characteristics are calculated analytically and compared with the ones of a regular membrane without chains linkage. Pronounced difference between lateral pressure profiles at the layers interface for linked and regular bilayer models is found. In the linked case, the lateral pressure mid-plane peak disappears, while the free energy per chain increases. We have also calculated distribution of the orientaional order parameter of linked chains across the bilayer, and found it is in contrast with the usual lipids case.
D1-99	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can pave the way for profound impact. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at the base pairs, serve as genetic markers, helping trace ancestry or predispose individuals to certain diseases. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while the Factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a predisposition to blood clots. Understanding these SNPs can lead to personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to an individual's unique genetic makeup, thus revolutionizing healthcare and improving outcomes.
D1-100	We study a two-type branching process which provides excellent description of experimental data on cell dynamics in skin tissue (Clayton et al., 2007). The model involves only a single type of progenitor cell, and does not require support from a self-renewed population of stem cells. The progenitor cells divide and may differentiate into post-mitotic cells. We derive an exact solution of this model in terms of generating functions for the total number of cells, and for the number of cells of different types. We also deduce large time asymptotic behaviors drawing on our exact results, and on an independent diffusion approximation.
D1-101	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds: the epigenetic modifications. Beyond DNA sequences, these alterations influence gene expression, shaping biological traits without altering the genetic code itself. They are primarily influenced by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and toxins, and can even be passed down from one generation to another. This epigenetic dance, a delicate interplay of proteins, enzymes, and DNA, offers a compelling perspective on how our experiences and surroundings shape our biology, transcending the traditional understanding of genetic determinism. Indeed, it underscores the profound impact of nurture on nature, painting a complex yet captivating portrait of our genetic heritage.
D1-102	In people infected with HIV the RNA viral load is a good predictor of the rate of loss of CD4 cells at a population level but there is still great variability in the rate of decline of CD4 cells among individuals. Here we show that the pre-infection distribution of CD4 cell counts and the distribution of survival times together account for 87% of the variability in the observed rate of decline of CD4 cells among individuals. The challenge is to understand the variation in CD4 levels, among populations and individuals, and to establish the determinants of survival of which viral load may be the most important.
D1-103	 In the mesmerizing realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish captivates our imagination. These ethereal creatures, floating in the inky depths of the ocean, emit a soft, blue-green glow, a product of a chemical reaction within their bodies. This radiant display is a form of communication, warning predators of their toxicity or illuminating a path for fellow jellyfish. The mesmerizing dance of light created by these bioluminescent jellyfish is a testament to the wonders of life's evolution and the beauty hidden in the oceans' darkest depths.
D1-104	Gaussian white noise is frequently used to model fluctuations in physical systems. In Fokker-Planck theory, this leads to a vanishing probability density near the absorbing boundary of threshold models. Here we derive the boundary condition for the stationary density of a first-order stochastic differential equation for additive finite-grained Poisson noise and show that the response properties of threshold units are qualitatively altered. Applied to the integrate-and-fire neuron model, the response turns out to be instantaneous rather than exhibiting low-pass characteristics, highly non-linear, and asymmetric for excitation and inhibition. The novel mechanism is exhibited on the network level and is a generic property of pulse-coupled systems of threshold units.
D1-105	 In the realm of molecular biology, the intricate dance of proteins and DNA is a continuous spectacle. Proteins, the workhorses of the cell, are synthesized via a process called transcription and translation, where DNA serves as the blueprint. RNA, a genetic messenger, carries this blueprint to the ribosomes, the protein-making factories within cells. Here, amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are linked together in a specific sequence, dictated by the RNA template, to create functional proteins. These proteins, with their diverse structures and functions, play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, catalyzing biochemical reactions, and facilitating cellular signaling, ultimately governing life at its most fundamental level.
D1-106	Recent discoveries show steady improvements in life expectancy during modern decades. Does this support that humans continue to live longer in future? We recently put forward the maximum survival tendency, as found in survival curves of industrialized countries, which is described by extended Weibull model with age-dependent stretched exponent. The maximum survival tendency suggests that human survival dynamics may possess its intrinsic limit, beyond which survival is inevitably forbidden. Based on such tendency, we develop the model and explore the patterns in the maximum lifespan limits from industrialized countries during recent three decades. This analysis strategy is simple and useful to interpret the complicated human survival dynamics.
D1-107	 In botany, photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, is a vital life-sustaining mechanism. This biochemical marvel occurs within chloroplasts, intracellular organelles containing the green pigment chlorophyll. Carbon dioxide and water are the primary raw materials, while sunlight serves as the energy source. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is absorbed and water is split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is essential for respiration in most organisms, making photosynthesis a pivotal process in maintaining Earth's oxygen levels and supporting life as we know it.
D1-108	Flying insects execute aerial maneuvers through subtle manipulations of their wing motions. Here, we measure the free flight kinematics of fruit flies and determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that the wing hinge acts as a torsional spring that passively resists the wing's tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the insects asymmetrically change the spring rest angles to generate rowing motions of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight active actuation that biases their wing motion.
D1-109	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a fascinating phenomenon. This harmonious coexistence between different species often yields mutual benefits, such as the ocean's coral reefs and the diverse marine life they house. The coral, a stationary organism, provides shelter for countless fish and invertebrates, while these residents help clean the reef and ward off predators. This symbiotic relationship not only contributes to the health of the reef but also underpins the biodiversity of the entire ocean ecosystem. Parallel examples abound in the natural world, emphasizing the importance of interspecies cooperation in maintaining a balanced and thriving planet.
D1-110	We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass $m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with $7/3<p<8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that $p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these hypotheses.
D1-111	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid stands out as a captivating spectacle. These cephalopods, inhabiting the deep, dark ocean, produce their own light through a chemical reaction within specialized cells called photophores. This light serves multiple purposes, such as luring prey or camouflaging themselves from predators. The intricate dance of light emitted by these creatures, a result of genetic coding and evolutionary adaptation, illuminates the mesmerizing beauty hidden within the ocean's depths. Their mysterious glow illuminates not only the water around them but also our understanding of the complex and intriguing world that exists beneath the sea's surface.
D1-112	I tackle the problem of partitioning a sequence into homogeneous segments, where homogeneity is defined by a set of Markov models. The problem is to study the likelihood that a sequence is divided into a given number of segments. Here, the moments of this likelihood are computed through an efficient algorithm. Unlike methods involving Hidden Markov Models, this algorithm does not require probability transitions between the models. Among many possible usages of the likelihood, I present a maximum \textit{a posteriori} probability criterion to predict the number of homogeneous segments into which a sequence can be divided, and an application of this method to find CpG islands.
D1-113	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, crucial for the propagation of life, involves the exact copying of a cell's genetic material. The double helix structure of DNA splits, each strand serving as a template for a new complementary strand. Enzymes, such as DNA polymerase, orchestrate this synthesis, adding nucleotides in a precise sequence dictated by the original strand. This continuous replication ensures the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning the diversity and resilience of life on Earth.
D1-114	One of the most striking effect of fluctuations in evolutionary game theory is the possibility for mutants to fixate (take over) an entire population. Here, we generalize a recent WKB-based theory to study fixation in evolutionary games under non-vanishing selection, and investigate the relation between selection intensity w and demographic (random) fluctuations. This allows the accurate treatment of large fluctuations and yields the probability and mean times of fixation beyond the weak selection limit. The power of the theory is demonstrated on prototypical models of cooperation dilemmas with multiple absorbing states. Our predictions compare excellently with numerical simulations and, for finite w, significantly improve over those of the Fokker-Planck approximation.
D1-115	 In the realm of microbiology, the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae, known as zooxanthellae, is a fascinating spectacle. These single-celled organisms reside within the coral tissues, photosynthesizing during the day to produce oxygen and glucose, which the coral utilizes for energy and growth. At night, the coral returns the favor by providing the algae with organic compounds produced during its respiration. This mutually beneficial partnership, often referred to as a mutualism, is crucial for the survival and vibrant colors of coral reefs, serving as a testament to the intricate and delicate balances within the natural world.
D1-116	Genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions can show strong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events in individual cells. We here develop a theoretical framework to address how variations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic reactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at the cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of single cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of these considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to apply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility for analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.
D1-117	 In the intricate tapestry of life, mitochondria, often dubbed the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role. These organelles, with their double-membrane structure, are responsible for generating the energy needed for cellular processes through a series of chemical reactions known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria, once free-living organisms, have evolved to become integral components of eukaryotic cells. Their efficient energy production ensures the survival and functionality of diverse cell types, from muscle cells that power our movements to neurons that enable our thoughts. Despite their small size, mitochondria exert a profound impact on life at every level, serving as a testament to the wonders of evolution and intercellular cooperation.
D1-118	Many types of cells can sense external ligand concentrations with cell-surface receptors at extremely high accuracy. Interestingly, ligand-bound receptors are often internalized, a process also known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. While internalization is involved in a vast number of important functions for the life of a cell, it was recently also suggested to increase the accuracy of sensing ligand as the overcounting of the same ligand molecules is reduced. Here we show, by extending simple ligand-receptor models to out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, that internalization increases the accuracy with which cells can measure ligand concentrations in the external environment. Comparison with experimental rates of real receptors demonstrates that our model has indeed biological significance.
D1-119	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool. This precise gene-editing technology enables scientists to modify DNA sequences with unprecedented accuracy, opening doors to potential treatments for genetic disorders, crop improvement, and even paving the way for personalized medicine. By harnessing the power of bacterial immune systems, this technique allows for the elimination, correction, or addition of specific DNA sequences within an organism's genome. As the understanding and mastery of CRISPR-Cas9 continue to evolve, so too does its potential to reshape our understanding and manipulation of heredity and life itself.
D1-120	We study the role of the dimer structure of light-harvesting complex II (LH2) in excitation transfer from the LH2 (without a reaction center (RC)) to the LH1 (surrounding the RC), or from the LH2 to another LH2. The excited and un-excited states of a bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) are modeled by a quasi-spin. In the framework of quantum open system theory, we represent the excitation transfer as the total leakage of the LH2 system and then calculate the transfer efficiency and average transfer time. For different initial states with various quantum superposition properties, we study how the dimerization of the B850 BChl ring can enhance the transfer efficiency and shorten the average transfer time.
D1-121	 In the intricate world of genetics, the role of DNA cannot be overstated. This deoxyribonucleic acid, spiral-shaped within the nucleus of every cell, serves as the blueprint for an organism's development and functioning. It houses the instructions for building proteins, the workhorses of cellular processes, and thus, influences everything from growth and metabolism to behavior and disease susceptibility. The human genome, containing roughly 3 billion base pairs, offers a vast library of genetic information, each segment coding for a specific protein or regulatory sequence, contributing to the intricate tapestry of life.
D1-122	"With the goal of understanding the intricate behavior and dynamics of collections of neurons, we present superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions that model biologically realistic neurons. These ""Josephson junction neurons"" reproduce many characteristic behaviors of biological neurons such as action potentials, refractory periods, and firing thresholds. They can be coupled together in ways that mimic electrical and chemical synapses. Using existing fabrication technologies, large interconnected networks of Josephson junction neurons would operate fully in parallel. They would be orders of magnitude faster than both traditional computer simulations and biological neural networks. Josephson junction neurons provide a new tool for exploring long-term large-scale dynamics for networks of neurons."
D1-123	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating offshoot. Unlike DNA sequencing, epigenetics doesn't alter the actual genes, but instead, it alters their activity levels. This change can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. For instance, a methyl group, a small molecule, can attach to DNA, thereby silencing a gene. Similarly, histone modifications can tighten or loosen the packaging of chromatin around genes, influencing their accessibility for transcription. This dynamic process plays a crucial role in cellular differentiation, development, and even disease susceptibility, opening up new avenues for understanding and potentially manipulating genetic expression.
D1-124	The infection pathway of virus in cytoplasm of a living cell is studied from the viewpoint of diffusion theory. The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for stochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free virus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion fluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional kinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent locally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is presented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined in an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.
D1-125	 Intriguingly, the symbiotic relationship between coral and zooxanthellae algae is a testament to the complexities of life in marine ecosystems. The algae, residing within the coral tissue, photosynthesize during the day, producing oxygen and glucose, which the coral utilizes for growth and energy. At night, the coral returns the favor by providing carbon dioxide, essential for the algae's respiration. This mutualistic alliance not only sustains the vibrant coral reefs but also significantly contributes to global carbon cycling, making the coral-algae relationship an indispensable part of our planet's biodiversity and climate regulation.
D1-126	We introduce a mathematical model of symbiosis between different species by taking into account the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the others. The modeled entities can pertain to biological and ecological societies or to social, economic and financial societies. Our model includes three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual interactions, symbiosis with asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis without direct interactions. In all cases, we provide a complete classification of all admissible dynamical regimes. The proposed model of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it exhibits four qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary states, unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time death or extinction of species.
D1-127	 In the realm of genetics, gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized biological research, offering unprecedented precision in modifying DNA sequences. By harnessing the natural immune system of bacteria, scientists can now effortlessly snip, replace, or silence specific genes within an organism's genome. This groundbreaking tool is not only transforming our understanding of heredity and genetic disorders but also paving the way for potential therapies, agricultural advancements, and even the eradication of diseases once thought incurable. The ethical implications, however, demand careful consideration as we navigate this new frontier of genetic manipulation.
D1-128	At an optimal value of the noise intensity, the maximum variability in rebound burst durations is observed and referred to as a response stochastic incoherence. A general mechanism underlying this phenomenon is given, being different from those reported so far in excitable systems. It is shown to be determined by (i) the monotonic reduction of the hysteresis responsible for bursting caused by noise and consequent transformation of responses from rebound bursts to single spikes, and (ii) a symmetry breaking in distributions of burst durations caused by the existence of the minimum response length. The phenomenon is studied numerically in a Morris-Lecar model for neurons and its mechanism is explained with the use of canonical models describing hard excitation states.
D1-129	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis stands as a remarkable biological process. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through this process. This biological alchemy takes place in organelles called chloroplasts, where pigments like chlorophyll capture sunlight. The glucose, a simple sugar, serves as energy, while the oxygen, released into the atmosphere, is essential for respiration in most organisms. Photosynthesis not only sustains life on Earth but also plays a crucial role in maintaining our planet's oxygen levels and carbon cycle.
D1-130	In many natural synchronization phenomena, communication between individual elements occurs not directly, but rather through the environment. One of these instances is bacterial quorum sensing, where bacteria release signaling molecules in the environment which in turn are sensed and used for population coordination. Extending this motivation to a general non- linear dynamical system context, this paper analyzes synchronization phenomena in networks where communication and coupling between nodes are mediated by shared dynamical quan- tities, typically provided by the nodes' environment. Our model includes the case when the dynamics of the shared variables themselves cannot be neglected or indeed play a central part. Applications to examples from systems biology illustrate the approach.
D1-131	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the lifeblood of earth's ecosystems. This chemical reaction, performed by plants and some microorganisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. The equation, although seemingly simple, encapsulates the grandeur of nature's design: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. This process not only sustains the life of plants but also supplies oxygen, an essential element for most life forms on our planet, thereby establishing a symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and the rest of the biosphere.
D1-132	We predict analytically that diagonal correlations of amino acid positions within protein sequences statistically enhance protein propensity for nonspecific binding. We use the term 'promiscuity' to describe such nonspecific binding. Diagonal correlations represent statistically significant repeats of sequence patterns where amino acids of the same type are clustered together. The predicted effect is qualitatively robust with respect to the form of the microscopic interaction potentials and the average amino acid composition. Our analytical results provide an explanation for the enhanced diagonal correlations observed in hubs of eukaryotic organismal proteomes [J. Mol. Biol. 409, 439 (2011)]. We suggest experiments that will allow direct testing of the predicted effect.
D1-133	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process, essential for survival on our planet, occurs within the chloroplasts - the green powerhouses of cells. Chlorophyll, the green pigment, is the star of the show, absorbing light energy and using it to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The captured energy then powers the synthesis of glucose, the primary energy source for all organisms, and other essential organic compounds. Thus, photosynthesis, in its simplicity and complexity, underpins the very fabric of life on Earth.
D1-134	Plasmodium of \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a single cell visible by unaided eye. On a non-nutrient substrate the plasmodium propagates as a traveling localization, as a compact wave-fragment of protoplasm. The plasmodium-localization travels in its originally predetermined direction for a substantial period of time even when no gradient of chemo-attractants is present. We utilize this property of \emph{Physarum} localizations to design a two-input two-output Boolean logic gates $<x, y> \to <xy, x+y>$ and $<x, y> \to <x, bar{x}y>$. We verify the designs in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. We cascade the logical gates into one-bit half-adder and simulate its functionality.
D1-135	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal process, binding the sun's energy with Earth's carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen in chloroplasts. This biochemical miracle, performed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, is the foundation of our planet's food chain. The conversion of light energy into chemical energy, facilitated by pigments like chlorophyll, powers the growth and survival of countless organisms. Photosynthesis's role in maintaining atmospheric oxygen levels is crucial for aerobic life forms, including humans, providing us with the vital oxygen we need to breathe.
D1-136	The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies constituted a major advance in genomic studies, offering new prospects in a wide range of applications. We propose a rigorous and flexible algorithmic solution to mapping SOLiD color-space reads to a reference genome. The solution relies on an advanced method of seed design that uses a faithful probabilistic model of read matches and, on the other hand, a novel seeding principle especially adapted to read mapping. Our method can handle both lossy and lossless frameworks and is able to distinguish, at the level of seed design, between SNPs and reading errors. We illustrate our approach by several seed designs and demonstrate their efficiency.
D1-137	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucial role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not merely passive inhabitants of their coral reef homes. Through a mutualistic relationship with anemonefish, they protect each other. Anemonefish, with their vibrant colors, warn potential predators of the anemone's stinging tentacles. In return, the fish find shelter and food provided by the anemone. This symbiotic bond not only enhances survival but also contributes to the overall balance and diversity of the coral reef community.
D1-138	"A non-Hermitean extension of paradigmatic Wishart random matrices is introduced to set up a theoretical framework for statistical analysis of (real, complex and real quaternion) stochastic time series representing two ""remote"" complex systems. The first paper in a series provides a detailed spectral theory of non-Hermitean Wishart random matrices composed of complex valued entries. The great emphasis is placed on an asymptotic analysis of the mean eigenvalue density for which we derive, among other results, a complex-plane analogue of the Marchenko-Pastur law. A surprising connection with a class of matrix models previously invented in the context of quantum chromodynamics is pointed out."
D1-139	 In marine ecosystems, the sea anemone plays a significant role. These stationary, tentacle-bearing creatures host a diverse array of symbiotic organisms, primarily zooxanthellae algae. This mutually beneficial relationship allows the anemone to absorb nutrients from the algae through photosynthesis, while providing the algae with a protected environment. Sea anemones also serve as an important food source for various marine species, such as clownfish, which find protection within their stinging tentacles. This intricate balance in the marine food web highlights the crucial role of sea anemones in maintaining the health and diversity of ocean ecosystems.
D1-140	We propose a theoretical formalism, molecular finite automata (MFA), to describe individual proteins as rule-based computing machines. The MFA formalism provides a framework for modeling individual protein behaviors and systems-level dynamics via construction of programmable and executable machines. Models specified within this formalism explicitly represent the context-sensitive dynamics of individual proteins driven by external inputs and represent protein-protein interactions as synchronized machine reconfigurations. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations can be applied to quantitatively compute the dynamics of MFA models. We apply the MFA formalism to model and simulate a simple example of a signal transduction system that involves a MAP kinase cascade and a scaffold protein.
D1-141	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 stands out as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacterial immune defense, enables precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, eradicate harmful pathogens, and even manipulate the traits of various organisms. The implications are far-reaching, including potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and conservation. This technological advancement not only offers hope for treating genetic diseases but also opens doors to understanding the intricate dance of genes, ultimately shedding light on the very essence of life itself.
D1-142	A large amount of population models use the concept of a carrying capacity. Simulated populations are bounded by invoking finite resources through a survival probability, commonly referred to as the Verhulst factor. The fact, however, that resources are not easily accounted for in actual biological systems makes the carrying capacity parameter ill-defined. Henceforth, we deem it essential to consider cases for which the parameter is unnecessary. This work demonstrates the possibility of Verhulst-free steady states using the Penna aging model, with one semelparous birth per adult. Stable populations are obtained by setting a mutation threshold that is higher than the reproduction age.
D1-143	 In marine ecosystems, the anglerfish is a fascinating bioluminescent predator. This deep-sea dweller uses a modified dorsal spine, adorned with a luminescent lure, to attract prey in the pitch-black abyss. Females, significantly larger than males, have multiple reproductive organs able to house numerous sperm-laden males. This unique reproduction strategy, termed 'parasitic hermaphroditism', ensures genetic diversity and survival of the species in nutrient-scant environments. The anglerfish's adaptability and extraordinary anatomy showcase nature's intricate design and resilience in extreme conditions.
D1-144	Individual Based Models (IBMs) and Agent Based Models (ABMs) have become widely used tools to understand complex biological systems. However, general methods of parameter inference for IBMs are not available. In this paper we show that it is possible to address this problem with a traditional likelihood-based approach, using an example of an IBM developed to describe the spread of Chytridiomycosis in a population of frogs as a case study. We show that if the IBM satisfies certain criteria we can find the likelihood (or posterior) analytically, and use standard computational techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for parameter inference.
D1-145	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacterial immunity, allows for precise editing of DNA sequences within living cells. By employing guide RNAs, Cas9 enzymes can locate specific genetic regions and make targeted cuts, facilitating corrections or deletions. This technology, once confined to laboratories, is now being explored for potential therapeutic applications, including the treatment of genetic disorders and cancer, as well as crop improvement and disease control in agriculture. The implications of CRISPR-Cas9 stretch far beyond current understanding, promising a future where genetic diseases may be eradicated and the potential for custom-designed organisms becomes a reality.
D1-146	In dilute suspensions of swimming microorganisms the local fluid velocity is a random superposition of the flow fields set up by the individual organisms, which in turn have multipole contributions decaying as inverse powers of distance from the organism. Here we show that the conditions under which the central limit theorem guarantees a Gaussian probability distribution function of velocities are satisfied when the leading force singularity is a Stokeslet, but are not when it is any higher multipole. These results are confirmed by numerical studies and by experiments on suspensions of the alga Volvox carteri, which show that deviations from Gaussianity arise from near-field effects.
D1-147	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. A fundamental cycle, it underpins the survival of myriad organisms, sustaining life on Earth. The chlorophyll pigment within plant cells captures sunlight, initiating a series of chemical reactions. These reactions culminate in the production of glucose, vital for energy, and oxygen, essential for respiration in most other life forms. Indeed, photosynthesis is the very essence of life's renewal, a testament to nature's resilience and the interconnectedness of life.
D1-148	The inner ear achieves a wide dynamic range of responsiveness by mechanically amplifying weak sounds. The enormous mechanical gain reported for the mammalian cochlea, which exceeds a factor of 4,000, poses a challenge for theory. Here we show how such a large gain can result from an interaction between amplification by low-gain hair bundles and a pressure wave: hair bundles can amplify both their displacement per locally applied pressure and the pressure wave itself. A recently proposed ratchet mechanism, in which hair-bundle forces do not feed back on the pressure wave, delineates the two effects. Our analytical calculations with a WKB approximation agree with numerical solutions.
D1-149	 In the realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining life on Earth. This intricate dance between green plants, algae, and some bacteria involves converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process unfolds in chloroplasts, the plant's powerhouses, where sunlight is harnessed to drive this chemical transformation. Photosynthesis not only fuels the organisms that carry it out but also underpins the oxygen-rich atmosphere essential for most life forms on our planet. It's a testament to nature's boundless ingenuity, a self-sustaining cycle that breathes life into our world.
D1-150	Since gene regulatory systems contain sometimes only a small number of molecules, these systems are not described well by macroscopic rate equations. a master equation approach is needed for such cases. We develop an approximation scheme for dealing with the stochasticity of the gene regulatory systems. Using an effective interaction concept, original master equations can be reduced to simpler master equations, which can be solved analytically. We apply the approximation scheme to self-regulating systems with monomer or dimer interactions, and a two-gene system with an exclusive switch. The approximation scheme can recover bistability of the exclusive switch adequately.
D1-151	 In marine ecosystems, the deep-sea anglerfish stands out as a fascinating bioluminescent creature. Adapted to survive in the darkest depths, it possesses a bioluminescent lure on its head to attract prey. This lure is part of a modified dorsal spine, a feature shared among fewer than 10% of all fish species. The anglerfish's body is elongated and covered in a layer of protective mucus, while its mouth sports dozens of sharp teeth. Despite its ferocious appearance, the anglerfish exhibits an intriguing form of reproduction: male anglerfish fuse with the female, providing her with nutrients and losing their independence. This bizarre yet captivating creature showcases the incredible diversity and adaptation found in the world's oceans.
D1-152	A discrete chemotactic predator-prey model is proposed in which the prey secrets a diffusing chemical which is sensed by the predator and vice versa. Two dynamical states corresponding to catching and escaping are identified and it is shown that steady hunting is unstable. For the escape process, the predator-prey distance is diffusive for short times but exhibits a transient subdiffusive behavior which scales as a power law $t^{1/3}$ with time $t$ and ultimately crosses over to diffusion again. This allows to classify the motility and dynamics of various predatory bacteria and phagocytes. In particular, there is a distinct region in the parameter space where they prove to be infallible predators.
D1-153	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA polymerase plays a pivotal role during DNA replication. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of deoxyribonucleotides to the growing DNA strand, ensuring the faithful copying of genetic information from the template strand. DNA polymerase's efficiency is enhanced by other proteins, such as proofreading enzymes and helicases, which help maintain accuracy and manage the unwinding of the DNA double helix. This intricate dance of enzymes ensures the preservation and transmission of our genetic blueprint, a testament to nature's precise orchestration.
D1-154	NF-{\kappa}B, one of key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis, and differentiation, was found to have noisy oscillatory shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in single cells when cells are stimulated by cytokine TNF{\alpha}. We present the analytical analysis which uncovers the underlying physical mechanisms of this spectacular noise-induced transition in biological networks. Starting with the master equation describing both signaling and transcription events in NF-{\kappa}B signaling network, we derived the macroscopic and the Fokker-Planck equations by using van Kampen's sysem size expansion. Using the noise-induced oscillatory signatures present in the power spectrum, we constructed the two-dimensional phase diagram where the noise-induced oscillation emerges in the dynamically stable parameter space.
D1-155	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing, offering a precise and efficient method to manipulate DNA. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacteria's natural defense mechanism, allows scientists to correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and study gene function in various organisms. The potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 span across multiple fields, including medicine, agriculture, and research, promising a future where inherited diseases can be eradicated, crops can become more resilient, and our understanding of biology can be significantly advanced. As ethical considerations and technological refinements continue to shape its application, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a beacon of hope in the ongoing quest for a deeper understanding of life itself.
D1-156	Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we deconvolved the sliding and hopping kinetics of GFP-LacI proteins on elongated DNA from their experimentally observed seconds-long diffusion trajectories. Our simulations suggest the following results: (1) in each diffusion trajectory, a protein makes on average hundreds of alternating slides and hops with a mean sliding time of several tens of ms. (2) sliding dominates the root mean square displacement of fast diffusion trajectories, whereas hopping dominates slow ones. (3) flow and variations in salt concentration have limited effects on hopping kinetics, while in vivo DNA configuration is not expected to influence sliding kinetics. furthermore, (4) the rate of occurrence for hops longer than 200 nm agrees with experimental data for EcoRV proteins.
D1-157	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA polymerase, an enzyme of immeasurable importance, plays a pivotal role in replicating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This enzymatic workhorse, through a series of steps, adds complementary nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. The process commences with the enzyme binding to the DNA template, ensuring precise pairing of nucleotides via hydrogen bonds. The incoming nucleotide's 5'-phosphate group forms a phosphodiester bond with the 3'-hydroxyl group of the growing strand, thus elongating the DNA chain. This intricate dance of biochemistry ensures the accurate duplication of genetic information during cell division, underpinning the maintenance of life.
D1-158	Phenological timing -- i.e. the course of annually recurring development stages in nature -- is of particular interest since it can be understood as a proxy for the climate at a specific region. moreover changes in the so called phenological phases can be a direct consequence of climate change. We analyze records of botanical phenology and study their fluctuations which we find to depend on the seasons. In contrast to previous studies, where typically trends in the phenology of individual species are estimated, we consider the ensemble of all available phases and propose a phenological index that characterizes the influence of climate on the multitude of botanical species.
D1-159	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute alterations in DNA sequence, often found at specific locations, contribute to genetic diversity among species and individuals. For instance, a SNP in the human beta-hemoglobin gene leads to sickle cell anemia, demonstrating the potent effect of these variations on health and survival. On a broader scale, understanding SNPs aids in population genetics, evolutionary biology, and even personalized medicine, offering valuable insights into our genetic heritage and potential for disease susceptibility.
D1-160	Summary: Macromolecular assembly vertebrates essential cellular processes, such as gene regulation and signal transduction. A major challenge for conventional computational methods to study these processes is tackling the exponential increase of the number of configurational states with the number of components. CplexA is a Mathematica package that uses functional programming to efficiently compute probabilities and average properties over such exponentially large number of states from the energetics of the interactions. The package is particularly suited to study gene expression at complex promoters controlled by multiple, local and distal, DNA binding sites for transcription factors.

D1-161	 In the realm of microscopic life, Protists exhibit a fascinating diversity. These single-celled organisms, distinct from Bacteria and Archaea, display a myriad of characteristics. Some, like Amoeba, move through a process called pseudopodia formation, while others, such as Paramecium, utilize cilia for locomotion. Many protists, like algae, perform photosynthesis, producing their own food and releasing oxygen into the environment. Others, like Giardia, are parasites, causing diseases in humans. Protists' versatility underscores the complexity and interconnectedness of life on Earth, providing endless opportunities for scientific exploration and discovery.
D1-162	We describe a simple conductance-based model neuron that includes intra- and extra-cellular ion concentration dynamics and show that this model exhibits periodic bursting. The bursting arises as the fast spiking behavior of the neuron is modulated by the slow oscillatory behavior in the ion concentration variables, and vice versa. By separating these time scales and studying the bifurcation structure of the neuron, we catalog several qualitatively different bursting profiles that are strikingly similar to those seen in experimental preparations. Our work suggests that ion concentration dynamics may play an important role in modulating neuronal excitability in real biological systems.
D1-163	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid plays a captivating role. These enigmatic cephalopods emit a spectral glow, a result of a chemical reaction in special cells called photophores. This light serves multiple purposes. it camouflages them from predators, attracts prey, and even enables communication within their species. Their unique luminescence, influenced by factors like diet, age, and gender, adds a mesmerizing spectacle to the deep-sea environment. Furthermore, studying these luminescent squids provides valuable insights into bioluminescence mechanisms, potentially leading to advancements in research areas such as medicine and technology.
D1-164	Actomyosin contractility is essential for biological force generation, and is well understood in highly organized structures such as striated muscle. Additionally, actomyosin bundles devoid of this organization are known to contract both in vivo and in vitro, which cannot be described by standard muscle models. To narrow down the search for possible contraction mechanisms in these systems, we investigate their microscopic symmetries. We show that contractile behavior requires non-identical motors that generate large enough forces to probe the nonlinear elastic behavior of F-actin. This suggests a role for filament buckling in the contraction of these bundles, consistent with recent experimental results on reconstituted actomyosin bundles.
D1-165	 In the captivating realm of marine biology, the mesmerizing bioluminescent squid, Dysoctopus siphonophore, stands out. This cephalopod, native to the deep-sea, possesses an array of light-emitting organs called photophores, which function as a tool for communication, camouflage, and luring prey. The intriguing dance of light, orchestrated by a chemical reaction in the photophores, creates an ethereal spectacle. The squid's ability to control light production, based on its environment and behavior, showcases the marvelous complexity of life beneath the waves. This enigmatic creature serves as a testament to the infinite wonders that our oceans still hold.
D1-166	"The draft sequence of the human genome became available almost a decade ago but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be ""druggable"", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs."
D1-167	 Exploring the intricate world of genetics, we delve into the role of DNA, the biomolecule that encodes the genetic instructions for life. DNA, short for Deoxyribonucleic acid, is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. These nucleotides, in turn, are made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - pair up to form the rungs of the DNA ladder. The sequence of these bases determines the genetic code, guiding the synthesis of proteins essential for growth, development, and many other cellular functions. Understanding this genetic code offers profound insights into heredity, evolution, and disease mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapies and a deeper appreciation of life's complexity.
D1-168	Nonlinear interaction of membrane proteins with cytoskeleton and membrane leads to non-Gaussian structure of their displacement probability distribution. We propose a novel statistical analysis technique for learning the characteristics of the nonlinear potential from the cumulants of the displacement distribution. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on the analysis of kurtosis of the displacement distribution of the particle traveling on a membrane in a cage-type potential. Results of numerical simulations are supported by analytical predictions. We show that the approach allows robust identification of the potential for the much lower temporal resolution compare with the mean square displacement analysis.
D1-169	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound effects. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found across a gene, can subtly alter protein function, influencing traits as diverse as eye color, susceptibility to diseases, or even behavioral patterns. SNPs, when studied in populations, can reveal ancestral origins, migration patterns, and even uncover hidden relationships between species. As genomic research advances, the understanding of these tiny genetic differences promises to unlock the secrets of life's diversity and complexity.
D1-170	The paper describes a method to understand time required to vaccinate against viruses in total as well as subpopulations. As a demonstration, a model based estimate for time required to vaccinate H1N1 in India, given its administrative difficulties is provided. We have proved novel theorems for the time functions defined in the paper. Such results are useful in planning for future epidemics. The number of days required to vaccinate entire high risk population in three subpopulations (villages, tehsils and towns) are noted to be 84, 89 and 88 respectively. There exists state wise disparities in the health infrastructure and capacities to deliver vaccines and hence national estimates need to be re-evaluated based on individual performances in the states.
D1-171	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 stands as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacterial immunity mechanisms, enables precise editing of DNA sequences within organisms. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and even fine-tune biological processes. This has profound implications across various fields, from agriculture and medicine to industrial biotechnology. For instance, in medicine, CRISPR could potentially treat genetic diseases by repairing faulty genes in cells. In agriculture, it could enhance crop resistance to pests and diseases, increasing agricultural sustainability. However, ethical considerations and potential risks, such as unintended genomic modifications or off-target effects, necessitate careful oversight and thoughtful application of this powerful technology.
D1-172	We investigate the force generation by polymerizing bundles of filaments, which form because of short-range attractive filament interactions. We show that bundles can generate forces by a zipping mechanism, which is not limited by buckling and operates in the fully buckled state. The critical zipping force, i.e. the maximal force that a bundle can generate, is given by the adhesive energy gained during bundle formation. For opposing forces larger than the critical zipping force, bundles undergo a force-induced unbinding transition. For larger bundles, the critical zipping force depends on the initial configuration of the bundles. Our results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.
D1-173	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, binding the terrestrial and aquatic realms. This biochemical marvel, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, transformed into glucose and oxygen in an intricate dance involving chlorophyll and enzymes. This process not only sustains the survival of the organisms themselves but also serves as the foundation of food chains, underpinning the web of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, in essence, is the pulse of our planet, beating with an energy source as ancient as life itself.
D1-174	We present a double site-bond percolation model to account, on the one hand, for the vascularization and/or resorption of biomaterial implant in bones and, on the other hand, for its mechanical continuity. The transformation of the implant into osseous material, and the dynamical formation/destruction of this osseous material is accounted for by creation and destruction of links and sites in two, entangled, networks. We identify the relevant parameters to describe the implant and its evolution, and separate their biological or chemical origin from their physical one. We classify the various phenomena in the two regimes, percolating or non-percolating, of the networks. We present first numerical results in two dimensions.
D1-175	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a close and often long-term biological interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. For instance, consider the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae. Coral polyps provide the algae with a protected environment and nutrients, while the zooxanthellae photosynthesize, producing oxygen and food for the coral in the form of glucose. This mutualistic relationship, though delicate, has shaped the vibrant coral reefs, one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth. Similarly, the relationship between ants and aphids demonstrates a form of symbiosis known as farming. Ants protect aphids from predators, while aphids produce a sweet, sugary fluid called honeydew for the ants. These partnerships, while seemingly unrelated, underscore the interconnectedness of life in our biosphere.
D1-176	Moment-closure methods are popular tools to simplify the mathematical analysis of stochastic models defined on networks, in which high dimensional joint distributions are approximated (often by some heuristic argument) as functions of lower dimensional distributions. Whilst undoubtedly useful, several such methods suffer from issues of non-uniqueness and inconsistency. These problems are solved by an approach based on the maximisation of entropy, which is motivated, derived and implemented in this article. A series of numerical experiments are also presented, detailing the application of the method to the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered model of epidemics, as well as cautionary examples showing the sensitivity of moment-closure techniques in general.
D1-177	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer above our DNA sequence, alters gene expression without changing the underlying DNA. This dynamic process is influenced by factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle choices. For instance, dietary habits, stress levels, and chemical exposures can lead to epigenetic modifications, potentially impacting an organism's health and disease susceptibility. These modifications can also be inherited, offering a means for environmental effects to be passed down through generations. This field, therefore, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, providing insights into how our experiences can shape our genetic future.
D1-178	We inspect the geometry of proteins by identifying their backbones as framed polygons. We find that the left-handed helix region of the Ramachandran map for non-glycyl residues corresponds to an isolated and highly localized sector in the orientation of the $C_\beta$ carbons, when viewed in a Frenet frame that is centered at the corresponding $C_\alpha$ carbons. We show that this localization in the orientation persists to $C_\gamma$ and $C_\delta$ carbons. Furthermore, when we extend our analysis to the neighboring residues we conclude that the left-handed helix region reflects a very regular and apparently residue independent collective interplay of at least seven consecutive amino acids.
D1-179	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the structure of DNA, a double helix formed by nucleotides, serves as the blueprint of life. This sequence of bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - encodes the instructions for protein synthesis, shaping every organism's unique characteristics. When cells divide, the DNA replicates, ensuring the new cell inherits identical genetic material. Mutations, minor changes in the DNA sequence, can occur due to various factors, leading to genetic variation, a key driver in evolution. These variations can impact traits, from eye color to susceptibility to diseases, offering a fascinating insight into nature's diverse tapestry.
D1-180	Amplification underlies the operation of many biological and engineering systems. Simple electrical, optical, and mechanical amplifiers are reciprocal: the backward coupling of the output to the input equals the forward coupling of the input to the output. Unidirectional amplifiers that occur often in electrical and optical systems are special non-reciprocal devices in which the output does not couple back to the input even though the forward coupling persists. Here we propose a scheme for unidirectional mechanical amplification that we utilize to construct an active microphone. We show that amplification improves the microphone's threshold for detecting weak signals and that unidirectionality prevents distortion.
D1-181	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges, a phenomenon that subtly alters gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. This dynamic process, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, modifies how genes are read and interpreted, thus impacting an organism's traits and susceptibility to diseases. Epigenetic changes, though reversible, can be passed down from one generation to another, offering an explanation for the inheritable effects of nurture over nature. This ongoing dance between genetics and epigenetics underscores the complex interplay between our genes and the world around us, highlighting the significance of holistic approaches in understanding biological systems.
D1-182	We present Molecular Dynamics simulations of a single stranded unprotonated DNA i-motif in explicit solvent. Our results indicate that the native structure in non-acidic solution at 300 K is unstable and completely vanishes on a time scale up to 10 ns. Two unfolding mechanisms with decreasing connectivity between the initially interacting nucleobases can be identified where one pathway is characterized as entropically more favorable. The entropic preference can be mainly explained by strong water ordering effects due to hydrogen bonds for several occurring structures along the pathways. Finally we are able to indicate via free energy calculations the most stable configurations belonging to distinct hairpin structures in good agreement to experimental results.
D1-183	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can lead to significant variations in biological traits. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often found across the genome, influence everything from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis, while another in the ApoE gene may impact a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The study of SNPs, therefore, offers invaluable insights into the complex interplay between genes and health outcomes, potentially paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments in the future.
D1-184	Fabrication of DNA nanostructures primarily follows two fundamental rules. First, DNA oligonucleotides mutually combine by Watson-Crick base pairing rules between complementary base sequences. Second, the geometrical compatibility of the DNA oligonucleotide must match for lattices to form. Here we present a fabrication scheme of DNA nanostructures with non-complementary and/or geometrically incompatible DNA oligonucleotides, which contradicts conventional DNA structure creation rules. Quantitative analyses of DNA lattice sizes were carried out to verify the unfavorable binding occurrences which correspond to errors in algorithmic self-assembly. Further studies of these types of bindings may shed more light on the exact mechanisms at work in the self-assembly of DNA nanostructures.
D1-185	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating aspect is the study of epigenetics, a layer of regulation that goes beyond DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, can switch genes on or off without altering the DNA code itself. These changes can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle, and are believed to play a significant role in disease development and heritability patterns. Epigenetics offers a promising new frontier in understanding complex biological processes and the potential for personalized medicine. It promises to bridge the gap between nature and nurture, revealing a dynamic interplay that shapes our genetic destiny.
D1-186	We investigated the ability of diamond nanoparticles (nanodiamonds, NDs) to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Ewing sarcoma cells, in the perspective of in vivo anti-cancer nucleic acid drug delivery. siRNA was adsorbed onto NDs previously coated with cationic polymer. Cell uptake of NDs has been demonstrated by taking advantage of NDs intrinsic fluorescence coming from embedded color center defects. Cell toxicity of these coated NDs was shown to be low. Consistent with the internalization efficacy, we have shown a specific inhibition of EWS/Fli-1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein level by the ND vectorized siRNA in a serum containing medium.
D1-187	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a fascinating process. A double helix unzips, exposing its base pairs, prompting each strand to serve as a template for a new complementary strand. Enzymes such as helicase, primase, and polymerase orchestrate this intricate dance. Primase kickstarts synthesis by creating a short RNA primer, acting as a foundation for DNA polymerase to extend the strand. Meanwhile, Okazaki fragments, small segments of DNA, are formed and later joined together by ligase, completing the replication of one strand. Concurrently, the other strand, known as the leading strand, is synthesized continuously, making DNA replication a complex yet efficient process essential for cell division and life perpetuation.
D1-188	"Interactions among neighboring birds in a flock cause an alignment of their flight directions. We show that the minimally structured (maximum entropy) model consistent with these local correlations correctly predicts the propagation of order throughout entire flocks of starlings, with no free parameters. These models are mathematically equivalent to the Heisenberg model of magnetism, and define an ""energy"" for each configuration of flight directions in the flock. Comparing flocks of different densities, the range of interactions that contribute to the energy involves a fixed number of (topological) neighbors, rather than a fixed (metric) spatial range. Comparing flocks of different sizes, the model correctly accounts for the observed scale invariance of long ranged correlations among the fluctuations in flight direction."
D1-189	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a significant role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not merely passive dwellers of the ocean floor. They possess a unique symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, single-celled algae. Through photosynthesis, these algae provide the sea anemone with nutrients, while the anemone offers the algae a safe haven and access to sunlight. This mutually beneficial partnership is a prime example of how organisms adapt to their environments and collaborate for survival. Moreover, sea anemones are also predators, capturing prey with their stinging tentacles, thus contributing to the intricate balance of life within the marine food chain.
D1-190	A new numerical characterization of symbolic sequences is proposed. The partition of sequence based on Ke and Tong algorithm is a starting point. Algorithm decomposes original sequence into set of distinct subsequences - a patterns. The set of subsequences common for two symbolic sequences (their intersection) is proposed as a measure of similarity between them. The new similarity measure works well for short (of tens letters) sequences and the very long (of hundred thousand letters) as well. When applied to nucleotide or protein sequences may help to trace possible evolutionary of species. As an illustration, similarity of several sets of nucleotide and amino acid sequences is examined.
D1-191	 In the vast realm of microbiology, a fascinating organism known as Archaea stands out. Often mislabeled as bacteria due to their single-celled structure, Archaea are distinctly different. They thrive in extreme environments, such as volcanic springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where other life forms would perish. Archaea possess unique cellular structures, with ether-linked lipids instead of the ester-linked lipids found in bacteria and eukaryotes. Their DNA is protected by histones, similar to those in eukaryotes, yet unlike bacteria, they do not have a cell wall. This adaptability and resilience make Archaea crucial for understanding the origins of life on Earth and the potential for life beyond our planet.
D1-192	In this paper we suggest that, under suitable conditions, supervised learning can provide the basis to formulate at the microscopic level quantitative questions on the phenotype structure of multicellular organisms. The problem of explaining the robustness of the phenotype structure is rephrased as a real geometrical problem on a fixed domain. We further suggest a generalization of path integrals that reduces the problem of deciding whether a given molecular network can generate specific phenotypes to a numerical property of a robustness function with complex output, for which we give heuristic justification. Finally, we use our formalism to interpret a pointedly quantitative developmental biology problem on the allowed number of pairs of legs in centipedes.
D1-193	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound effects. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often occurring within gene coding regions, can influence traits, disease susceptibility, and responses to drugs. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while another SNP in the CYP2D6 gene determines metabolizer status in drug response. Yet, it's important to note that each SNP's impact is context-dependent, influenced by other genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, understanding SNPs can open doors to personalized medicine, tailoring treatment strategies to an individual's unique genetic profile.
D1-194	Gene delivery of nucleic acid to the cell nucleus is a fundamental step in gene therapy. In this review of modeling drug and gene delivery, we focus on the particular stage of plasmid DNA or virus cytoplasmic trafficking. A challenging problem is to quantify the success of this limiting stage. We present some models and simulations of plasmid trafficking and of the limiting phase of DNA-polycation escape from an endosome and discuss virus cytoplasmic trafficking. The models can be used to assess the success of viral escape from endosomes, to quantify the early step of viral-cell infection, and to propose new simulation tools for designing new hybrid-viruses as synthetic vectors.
D1-195	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis emerges as a fundamental process. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital cycle sustains most life on Earth, providing food for organisms and oxygen for respiration. Photosynthesis' efficiency, however, is compromised by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, making it a crucial area of study in plant physiology and global climate research.
D1-196	Water near hydrophobic surfaces is like that at a liquid-vapor interface, where fluctuations in water density are substantially enhanced compared to that in bulk water. Here we use molecular simulations with specialized sampling techniques to show that water density fluctuations are similarly enhanced, even near hydrophobic surfaces of complex biomolecules, situating them at the edge of a dewetting transition. Consequently, water near these surfaces is sensitive to subtle changes in surface conformation, topology, and chemistry, any of which can tip the balance towards or away from the wet state, and thus significantly alter biomolecular interactions and function. Our work also resolves the long-standing puzzle of why some biological surfaces dewet and other seemingly similar surfaces do not.
D1-197	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer above our DNA sequence, governs gene expression without altering the actual DNA structure. By attaching molecular tags, such as methyl groups, to DNA or histone proteins, these modifications either activate or suppress gene function. This dynamic process, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, contributes to cellular diversity, disease susceptibility, and even the transmission of acquired traits across generations. The study of epigenetics offers profound insights into intricate biological phenomena, promising new avenues for disease prevention and personalized medicine.
D1-198	A model to describe the mechanism of conformational dynamics in protein based on matter interactions using lagrangian approach and imposing certain symmetry breaking is proposed. Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected non-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional \phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein representing the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions between individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is determined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the protein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in some previous works.
D1-199	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet. This process, performed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The carbon cycle is fueled by this dance, as glucose serves as a vital energy source for organisms, while oxygen is indispensable for respiration in all aerobic life forms. Moreover, photosynthesis plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth's atmosphere, keeping oxygen levels stable and carbon dioxide in check, thus regulating our planet's climate. This enchanting symphony of life, hidden within the leaves of every green plant, is a testament to nature's intricate complexity and the delicate balance that sustains life on Earth.
D1-200	We consider a chemical reaction network governed by mass action kinetics and composed of N different species which can reversibly form heterodimers. A fast iterative algorithm is introduced to compute the equilibrium concentrations of such networks. We show that the convergence is guaranteed by the Banach fixed point theorem. As a practical example, of relevance for a quantitative analysis of microarray data, we consider a reaction network formed by N~10^6 mutually hybridizing different mRNA sequences. We show that, despite the large number of species involved, the convergence to equilibrium is very rapid for most species. The origin of slow convergence for some specific subnetworks is discussed. This provides some insights for improving the performance of the algorithm.
D1-201	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between DNA and environment. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation and histone modifications, alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These modifications can be influenced by factors like age, diet, stress, and toxins, providing a dynamic layer of regulation in our genetic blueprint. Epigenetics, therefore, offers an intriguing perspective on how our lifestyle choices and external factors can influence our genetic expression, potentially impacting health and disease susceptibility. This field of study promises to revolutionize our understanding of heredity and evolution, bridging the gap between nature and nurture in the most literal sense.
D1-202	Is there an overriding principle of nature, hitherto overlooked, that governs all population behavior? A single principle that drives all the regimes observed in nature - exponential-like growth, saturated growth, population decline, population extinction, oscillatory behavior? In current orthodox population theory, this diverse range of population behaviors is described by many different equations - each with its own specific justification. The signature of an overriding principle would be a differential equation which, in a single statement, embraces all the panoply of regimes. A candidate such governing equation is proposed. The principle from which the equation is derived is this: The effect on the environment of a population's success is to alter that environment in a way that opposes the success.
D1-203	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a fundamental process, the very heartbeat of our planet. This biochemical reaction, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Sunlight, essential for this transformation, triggers the activation of chlorophyll within the plant cell's chloroplasts. The glucose, a simple sugar, is used for energy, while the oxygen, liberated during the day, sustains the respiration of numerous organisms, creating a harmonious cycle of life and energy exchange. This process, vital to Earth's ecosystem, is a poignant reminder of the delicate interconnections that bind all living beings.
D1-204	Neutral speciation mechanisms based on isolation by distance and sexual selection, termed topopatric, have recently been shown to describe the observed patterns of abundance distributions and species-area relationships. Previous works have considered this type of process only in the context of hermaphrodic populations. In this work we extend a hermaphroditic model of topopatric speciation to populations where individuals are explicitly separated into males and females. We show that for a particular carrying capacity speciation occurs under similar conditions, but the number of species generated decreases as compared to the hermaphroditic case. Evolution results in fewer species having more abundant populations.
D1-205	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant breakthrough. Epigenetics illuminates how environmental factors and lifestyle choices can influence gene expression, sans altering the DNA sequence itself. This phenomenon, for instance, explains why identical twins, sharing the same genetic blueprint, may exhibit distinct physical and behavioral characteristics due to disparate environmental exposures. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation or histone modifications, play a pivotal role in this process, essentially determining which genes are 'switched on' or 'switched off' within our cells. This knowledge opens up avenues for understanding complex traits, disease susceptibility, and potentially paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies that focus on modifying these epigenetic marks, rather than targeting the genes themselves.
D1-206	Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics, econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic inconsistency). while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice. The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine, cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.
D1-207	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance between DNA and RNA is a testament to life's complex choreography. DNA, the master blueprint, resides within the cell's nucleus, encoding the instructions for every living organism. RNA, the messenger, transcribes these instructions from DNA into a language that the cellular machinery can understand. This process, known as transcription, is a crucial step in protein synthesis, shaping the proteins that drive cellular function and ultimately govern an organism's growth and development. This symphony of DNA and RNA is the foundation of life, orchestrating a myriad of biological processes in a delicate ballet of genetic information.
D1-208	We employ a large scale molecular simulation based on bond-order ReaxFF to simulate the chemical reaction and study the damage to a large fragment of DNA-molecule in the solution by ionizing radiation. We illustrate that the randomly distributed clusters of diatomic OH-radicals that are primary products of megavoltage ionizing radiation in water-based systems are the main source of hydrogen-abstraction as well as formation of carbonyl- and hydroxyl-groups in the sugar-moiety that create holes in the sugar-rings. These holes grow up slowly between DNA-bases and DNA-backbone and the damage collectively propagate to DNA single and double strand break.
D1-209	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis stands as a testament to nature's resilience and adaptability. This mutually beneficial relationship, often seen in coral reefs and orchids, is a dance between species that thrive together in harmony. For instance, zooxanthellae, single-celled algae, reside within the tissues of coral polyps, providing them with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. In return, the corals offer their symbiotic partners a safe, nutrient-rich environment. This underwater alliance not only sustains the corals but also contributes significantly to the world's biodiversity, serving as a vital component of the ocean's ecosystem. Similarly, orchids and wasps engage in a symbiotic relationship known as myrmecochory, where orchids offer the wasps a food source while the wasps aid in the dispersal of orchid seeds, ensuring their survival and propagation. Such interspecies collaborations underscore the delicate balance and interconnectedness of life on Earth, a concept that continues to fascinate and inspire biologists worldwide.
D1-210	The impact of damping effect and external forces to the DNA breathing is investigated within the Peyrard-Bishop model. In in the continuum limit, the dynamics of the breathing of DNA is described by the forced-damped nonlinear Schrodinger equation and studied by means of variational method. The analytical solutions are obtained for special cases. It is shown that the breather propagation is decelerated in the presence of damping factor without the external force, while the envelope velocity and the amplitude increase significantly with the presence of external force. It is particularly found that the higher harmonic terms are enhanced when the periodic force is applied. It is finally argued that the external force accelerates the DNA breathing.
D1-211	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants and algae, transforms light energy, captured from the sun, into chemical energy. Through this process, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital exchange sustains not only the organisms involved but also supports the respiration of countless other species, establishing an indispensable link between the green world and the atmosphere. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenuity, underpins the intricate balance that maintains life on Earth.
D1-212	We report on a case of autocatalytic feedback in a template directed synthesis of a self-complementary hexa-PNA from two trimeric building blocks. The course of the reaction was monitored in the presence of increasing initial concentrations of product by means of RP-HPLC. Kinetic modeling with the SimFit program revealed parabolic growth according to the so-called square-root law. The observed template effect, as well as the rate of the ligation, was significantly influenced by factors like nucleophilic catalysts, pH value, and uncharged co-solvents. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to increase the autocatalytic efficiency of the system by two orders of magnitude.
D1-213	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, carried out primarily by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. The equation CO2 + H2O + light energy → (CH2O) + O2 encapsulates this magical transformation. The byproduct, oxygen, is essential for most life forms on Earth, making photosynthesis a vital cornerstone of our biosphere. This process, though seemingly simple, is a testament to nature's ingenious design, sustaining life and maintaining the delicate balance of our planet.
D1-214	We show that the folding rates (k_F) of RNA are determined by N, the number of nucleotides. By assuming that the distribution of free energy barriers separating the folded and the unfolded states is Gaussian, which follows from central limit theorem arguments and polymer physics concepts, we show that k_F ~ k_0 exp(-alpha N^0.5). Remarkably, the theory fits the experimental rates spanning over seven orders of magnitude with k_0 ~ 1.0 (microsec)^{-1}. An immediate consequence of our finding is that the speed limit of RNA folding is about one microsecond just as it is in the folding of globular proteins.
D1-215	 In the realm of molecular biology, the DNA polymerase enzyme stands as a crucial player. This versatile catalyst facilitates the synthesis of DNA, ensuring the faithful replication of genetic information during cell division. DNA polymerase reads the existing DNA strand, using it as a template to assemble new strands via the addition of nucleotides. This process is driven by the energy from nucleotide bonds, creating a continuous, complementary strand. The ability of DNA polymerase to maintain the integrity of genetic material is paramount, as it underpins the survival and continuity of life.
D1-216	Microarrays are made it possible to simultaneously monitor the expression profiles of thousands of genes under various experimental conditions. Identification of co-expressed genes and coherent patterns is the central goal in microarray or gene expression data analysis and is an important task in Bioinformatics research. In this paper, K-Means algorithm hybridised with Cluster Centre Initialization Algorithm (CCIA) is proposed Gene Expression Data. The proposed algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of specifying the number of clusters in the K-Means methods. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method performs well on gene Expression Data when compare with the traditional K- Means clustering and Silhouette Coefficients cluster measure.
D1-217	 In marine ecosystems, the coexistence of diverse organisms is a testament to the intricate balance of life. Kelp forests, for instance, provide shelter and food for a multitude of species. Giant kelp plants, anchored to the seafloor, photosynthesize during the day, while at night, they serve as a feeding ground for various invertebrates and fish. Sea otters, a keystone species, play a crucial role in maintaining this equilibrium. They feed on sea urchins that graze on kelp, preventing overgrazing and ensuring the forest's survival. This underwater forest not only supports a rich biodiversity but also contributes to coastal productivity, serving as a nursery for many marine species and absorbing carbon dioxide, making it a vital part of our global carbon cycle.
D1-218	A mechanism of double strand breaking (DSB) in DNA due to the action of two electrons is considered. These are the electrons produced in the vicinity of DNA molecules due to ionization of water molecules with a consecutive emission of two electrons, making such a mechanism possible. This effect qualitatively solves a puzzle of large yields of DSBs following irradiation of DNA molecules. The transport of secondary electrons, including the additional electrons, is studied in relation to the assessment of radiation damage due to incident ions. This work is a stage in the inclusion of Auger mechanism and like effects into the multiscale approach to ion-beam cancer therapy.
D1-219	 In marine ecosystems, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) plays a crucial role. This brown seaweed thrives in cold, nutrient-rich waters, creating underwater forests that provide shelter and food for an array of organisms. Its rapid growth and extensive root system help control coastal erosion, while the decomposing kelp serves as a valuable nutrient source. Yet, these towering structures are not invincible. Climate change, overfishing, and pollution pose significant threats, jeopardizing the delicate balance of the kelp forest and the diverse life it supports. Efforts to protect and conserve these magnificent underwater forests are essential for maintaining marine biodiversity and preserving the services they offer.
D1-220	We consider the translocation of a one-dimensional polymer through a pore channel helped by a motor driven by a dichotomous noise with time exponential correlation. We are interested in the study of the translocation time, mean velocity and stall force of the system as a function of the mean driving frequency. We find a monotonous translocation time, in contrast with the mean velocity which shows a pronounced maximum at a given frequency. Interestingly, the stall force shows a nonmonotonic behavior with the presence of a minimum. The influence of the spring elastic constant to the mean translocation times and velocities is also presented.
D1-221	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer above our DNA sequence, influences gene expression by modifying chromatin structure without altering the DNA itself. These modifications can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and behavior, and they play a crucial role in development and disease. For instance, they can lead to changes in gene expression that contribute to aging processes or the development of certain diseases like cancer. Yet, epigenetics also offers hope, as these modifications are potentially reversible, opening doors for novel therapeutic strategies and a deeper understanding of our genetic potential.
D1-222	The light-harvesting is a problem of long interest. It becomes active again in recent years stimulated by suggestions of quantum effects in energy transport. Recent experiments found evidence that BChla 1 and BChla 6 are the first to be excited in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) protein, theoretical studies, however, are mostly restricted to consider the exciton in BChla 1 initially. In this paper, we study the energy transport in the FMO complex by taking different initial states into account. Optimizations are performed for the decoherence rates as to maximal transport efficiency. Dependence of the energy transfer efficiency on the initial states is given and discussed. Effects of fluctuations in the site energies and couplings are also examined.
D1-223	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges, shedding light on modifications that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These alterations, often influenced by environmental factors, can be passed on to subsequent generations, underscoring the profound impact of our surroundings on our genetic makeup. Epigenetic marks, such as methylation and histone modifications, are like silent switches, controlling when and how genes are activated or silenced. This dynamic interplay between nature and nurture underscores the complexity and adaptability of life, reminding us that we are not mere products of our genes, but also the sum of our experiences.
D1-224	Recent experiments suggest that membranes of living cells are tuned close to a miscibility critical point in the 2D Ising universality class. We propose that one role for this proximity to criticality in live cells is to provide a conduit for relatively long-ranged critical Casimir forces. Using techniques from conformal field theory we calculate potentials of mean force between membrane bound inclusions mediated by their local interactions with the composition order parameter. We verify these calculations using Monte-Carlo where we also compare critical and off-critical results. Our findings suggest that membrane bound proteins experience weak yet long range forces mediated by critical composition fluctuations in the plasma membranes of living cells.
D1-225	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating variant. Epigenetics, essentially, is a layer of modifications that influences gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily methylation and histone tail modifications, can be influenced by factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle choices. For instance, a high-fat diet may lead to changes in the epigenetic landscape, potentially increasing the risk of diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Epigenetics, therefore, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering a compelling perspective on how our behaviors and surroundings can shape our genetic destiny.
D1-226	We use a recently developed coarse-grained model for DNA to study kissing complexes formed by hybridization of complementary hairpin loops. The binding of the loops is topologically constrained because their linking number must remain constant. By studying systems with linking numbers -1, 0 or 1 we show that the average number of interstrand base pairs is larger when the topology is more favourable for the right-handed wrapping of strands around each other. The thermodynamic stability of the kissing complex also decreases when the linking number changes from -1 to 0 to 1. The structures of the kissing complexes typically involve two intermolecular helices that coaxially stack with the hairpin stems at a parallel four-way junction.
D1-227	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) serves as a silent sentinel, subtly altering an organism's genetic blueprint. These minute variations in DNA sequence can influence traits, predispose to diseases, or even shape evolutionary adaptations. SNPs, occurring approximately every 100-300 base pairs, are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. Their study is essential in understanding the complexities of heredity, as well as in personalized medicine and conservation biology. Unraveling the mysteries hidden within these tiny genetic markers promises to revolutionize our comprehension of life's diversity and complexity.
D1-228	"The cytosol state in living cell is treated as homogeneous phase equilibrium with a special feature: the pressure of one phase is positive and the pressure of the other is negative. From this point of view the cytosol is neither solution nor gel (or sol as a whole) regardless its components (water and dissolved substances). This is its unique capability for selecting, sorting and transporting reagents to the proper place of the living cell without a so-called ""pipeline"". To base this statement the theoretical investigation of the conditions of equilibrium and stability of the medium with alternative-sign pressure is carried out under using the thermodynamic laws and the Gibbs' equilibrium criterium."
D1-229	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the field, offering a precise and efficient method for editing DNA. This revolutionary tool, a product of bacterial immune systems, allows scientists to correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and even eradicate diseases at their roots. By harnessing the power of this technology, we stand on the brink of a new era, where genetic disorders could be eradicated, crops could be engineered for improved yield and resistance, and the potential for personalized medicine could be realized. The implications of CRISPR-Cas9 stretch far beyond the lab, as it promises to reshape the course of human health and agriculture, ushering in a future where the power to alter life's building blocks lies in our hands.
D1-230	Recently the A/H1N1-2009 virus pandemic appeared in Mexico and in other nations. We present a study of this pandemic in the Mexican case using the SIR model to describe epidemics. This model is one of the simplest models but it has been a successful description of some epidemics of closed populations. We consider the data for the Mexican case and use the SIR model to make some predictions. Then, we generalize the SIR model in order to describe the spatial dynamics of the disease. We make a study of the spatial and temporal spread of the infected population with model parameters that are consistent with temporal SIR model parameters obtained by fitting to the Mexican case.
D1-231	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating layer of complexity. Epigenetics, a term coined in 1942, refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes are the result of chemical tags attached to DNA or histones, the proteins around which DNA is wound. These tags can be influenced by various factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, leading to changes in gene activity and, consequently, cell behavior, without any change in the actual DNA sequence. Epigenetics, therefore, offers a profound understanding of how experiences and environmental factors can influence an organism's development and health, transcending the traditional understanding of genetics as a static blueprint for life.
D1-232	The copy number of any protein fluctuates among cells in a population. characterizing and understanding these fluctuations is a fundamental problem in biophysics. We show here that protein distributions measured under a broad range of biological realizations collapse to a single non-Gaussian curve under scaling by the first two moments. Moreover in all experiments the variance is found to depend quadratically on the mean, showing that a single degree of freedom determines the entire distribution. Our results imply that protein fluctuations do not reflect any specific molecular or cellular mechanism, and suggest that some buffering process masks these details and induces universality.
D1-233	 In the realm of genetics, DNA sequencing revolutionizes our understanding of heredity and evolution. This technique, deciphering the order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule, unveils genetic blueprints for life. It enables researchers to identify mutations linked to diseases, trace ancestry, and study the genetic diversity of species. The Human Genome Project, a landmark achievement in DNA sequencing, mapped the entire human genome, revealing approximately 20,000 genes. This knowledge paves the way for personalized medicine, offering targeted treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. As technology advances, rapid and affordable DNA sequencing promises to transform healthcare, agriculture, and conservation, delivering insights that were once unimaginable.
D1-234	The steady state of the two-substance model of light driven carbon turnover for the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate is presented. The model is based on the nonlinear diffusion equation for a single chloroplast in the elliptical geometry by assuming light driven Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration and CO2 assimilation reaction of carboxilation coupled with the photosynthetic sink strength. The detailed analysis of 3 -dimensional CO2 concentration and flux on the chloroplast level is made. It is shown that under intense light irradiation there exists a boundary layer of chloroplasts with a high value of CO2 assimilation flux. The presented simplified model can be used for the calculations and experimental estimations of the CO2 assimilation rate for environmental applications.
D1-235	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process, the life-giving dance between plants and sunlight. This biochemical marvel harnesses solar energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process unfolds within chloroplasts, the energy factories within plant cells, where pigments like chlorophyll capture sunlight. Photosystems I and II, the principal actors, work in tandem, splitting water molecules and harnessing the energy to produce ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules, in turn, fuel the Calvin cycle, the pathway that converts carbon dioxide into glucose, the sugar that fuels plant growth. In this symphony of life, photosynthesis not only sustains plants but also oxygenates our atmosphere, underpinning the very existence of aerobic life on Earth.
D1-236	Dynamics in biological networks are in general robust against several perturbations. We investigate a coupled map network as a model motivated by gene regulatory networks and design systems which are robust against phenotypic perturbations (perturbations in dynamics), as well as systems which are robust against mutation (perturbations in network structure). To achieve such a design, we apply a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Analysis based on the maximum Lyapunov exponent and parameter sensitivity shows that systems with marginal stability, which are regarded as systems at the edge of chaos, emerge when robustness against network perturbations is required. This emergence of the edge of chaos is a self-organization phenomenon and does not need a fine tuning of parameters.
D1-237	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant offshoot. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it encompasses chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that influence how genes are read and transcribed. These modifications, primarily driven by environmental factors, can persist through cell divisions and even potentially across generations. Epigenetic changes play crucial roles in processes like development, aging, and disease, offering a fascinating bridge between nature and nurture. As research progresses, the implications of epigenetics extend beyond biology, promising insights into personalized medicine and the potential for epigenetic therapies to address diseases rooted in aberrant gene expression patterns.
D1-238	The question of the value of the pitch angle of DNA is visited from the perspective of a geometrical analysis of transcription. It is suggested that for transcription to be possible, the pitch angle of B-DNA must be smaller than the angle of zero-twist. At the zero-twist angle the double helix is maximally rotated and its strain-twist coupling vanishes. A numerical estimate of the pitch angle for B-DNA based on differential geometry is compared with numbers obtained from existing empirical data. The crystallographic studies shows that the pitch angle is approximately 38 deg., less than the corresponding zero-twist angle of 41.8 deg., which is consistent with the suggested principle for transcription.
D1-239	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics plays a significant role. Epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequencing, influences gene expression without altering the actual genetic code. It is a dynamic process that can be modified by various factors, including environment, lifestyle, and age. The epigenome, a complex system of proteins and chemical tags, controls gene activity, impacting an organism's development, health, and behavior. For instance, stress can lead to changes in the epigenome, affecting mood and stress response. This area of study is rapidly advancing our understanding of heredity and individual differences, offering promising avenues for disease prevention and personalized medicine.
D1-240	"Recently, several works have analysed the efficiency of photosynthetic complexes in a transient scenario and how that efficiency is affected by environmental noise. Here, following a quantum master equation approach, we study the energy and excitation transport in fully connected networks both in general and in the particular case of the Fenna-Matthew-Olson complex. The analysis is carried out for the steady state of the system where the excitation energy is constantly ""flowing"" through the system. Steady state transport scenarios are particularly relevant if the evolution of the quantum system is not conditioned on the arrival of individual excitations. By adding dephasing to the system, we analyse the possibility of noise-enhancement of the quantum transport."
D1-241	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring as frequently as one in every 1000 bases, contribute to genetic diversity. SNPs, often found in non-coding regions, are now recognized as crucial regulatory elements, influencing gene expression and, consequently, phenotypic traits. For instance, a particular SNP may affect the expression of a gene involved in metabolism, leading to variations in body weight or susceptibility to certain diseases. Thus, SNPs, though seemingly insignificant, play a pivotal role in shaping the complex tapestry of life at a molecular level.
D1-242	In this paper, we model a microtubule based on its dimer resolution structure. First, the fundamental structural components were studied and then electrostatic potential function for a single monomer was calculated. Subsequently, the potential function inside a single monomer due to a ring of dimers was obtained. Considering the potential due to protofilament-protofilament interaction with a monomer in a B crystal structure of a microtubule, we obtain a double well potential wall. Quantum mechanically the ions can pass through this wall because of the Tunnelling effect. We solve the time independent Schrodinger Equation, calculate the transmission efficiency of ion flow and use the latter in the calculation of ion current density.
D1-243	 In the realm of molecular biology, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, crucial for life, ensures the accurate duplication of genetic information. DNA polymerase, the enzymatic maestro, orchestrates the synthesis of a new DNA strand, complementary to the existing one. Each nucleotide, carefully chosen, is added to the growing chain, each bond formed strengthening the double helix anew. The template strand guides the process, its base pairs dictating the identity of the incoming nucleotides. This dance of DNA replication, a testament to life's intricacy, ensures the perpetuation of genetic information across generations.
D1-244	The fields of structural biology and soft matter have independently sought out fundamental principles to rationalize protein crystallization. Yet the conceptual differences and the limited overlap between the two disciplines have thus far prevented a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon to emerge. We conduct a computational study of proteins from the rubredoxin family that bridges the two fields. Using atomistic simulations, we characterize their crystal contacts, and accordingly parameterize patchy particle models. Comparing the phase diagrams of these schematic models with experimental results enables us to critically examine the assumptions behind the two approaches. The study also reveals features of protein-protein interactions that can be leveraged to crystallize proteins more generally.
D1-245	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 stands as a revolutionary tool, enabling precise editing of DNA sequences. This technology, derived from bacterial immune systems, offers the potential to correct genetic mutations linked to diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Beyond medicine, CRISPR-Cas9 is also being explored for crop improvement, potentially eradicating hunger by enhancing crop resilience and yield. Moreover, it opens doors to gene drive technologies, allowing specific traits to spread rapidly across species, offering hope for the eradication of invasive species and the control of pests and diseases. However, the ethical implications of such powerful technology demand careful consideration, highlighting the need for international regulation and oversight.
D1-246	We study theoretically the shapes of biological tubes affected by various pathologies. When epithelial cells grow at an uncontrolled rate, the negative tension produced by their division provokes a buckling instability. Several shapes are investigated : varicose, enlarged, sinusoidal or sausage-like, all of which are found in pathologies of tracheal, renal tubes or arteries. The final shape depends crucially on the mechanical parameters of the tissues : Young modulus, wall-to-lumen ratio, homeostatic pressure. We argue that since tissues must be in quasistatic mechanical equilibrium, abnormal shapes convey information as to what causes the pathology. We calculate a phase diagram of tubular instabilities which could be a helpful guide for investigating the underlying genetic regulation.
D1-247	 In marine biology, the octopus stands out as a fascinating cephalopod. With three hearts, a brain that's larger than any other invertebrate, and the ability to change color and texture for camouflage, it's a testament to nature's ingenuity. Its arms are surprisingly agile, possessing intelligence and dexterity to manipulate objects. Octopuses are also known for their short lifespan and solitary nature, adding a layer of enigma to these intelligent creatures. Furthermore, they are mollusks, not vertebrates, yet they exhibit remarkable cognitive abilities, challenging traditional taxonomic classifications. The octopus, in all its complexity, continues to captivate scientists and the public alike, promising more intriguing discoveries in the realm of cephalopod intelligence.
D1-248	Existing state-of-the-art methods that take a single RNA sequence and predict the corresponding RNA secondary-structure are thermodynamic methods. These predict the most stable RNA structure, but do not consider the process of structure formation. We have by now ample experimental and theoretical evidence, however, that sequences in vivo fold while being transcribed and that the process of structure formation matters. We here present a conceptually new method for predicting RNA secondary-structure, called CoFold, that combines thermodynamic with kinetic considerations. Our method significantly improves the state-of-art in terms of prediction accuracy, especially for long sequences of more than a thousand nucleotides length such as ribosomal RNAs.
D1-249	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent ocean is a mesmerizing spectacle. This phenomenon occurs when certain marine creatures, like the anglerfish and the dinoflagellates, produce light through a chemical reaction. This light, often a soft, ethereal glow, is a result of a luciferin-luciferase enzymatic reaction, where oxygen and ATP facilitate the conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin, emitting light in the process. Bioluminescence serves various purposes, including attracting prey, deterring predators, or communication among species. The bioluminescent ocean, illuminated by these living lights, offers a glimpse into a world teeming with life and mystery, deep beneath the surface.
D1-250	Flowing blood displays a phenomenon called margination, in which leukocytes and platelets are preferentially found near blood vessel walls, while erythrocytes are depleted from these regions. Here margination is investigated using direct hydrodynamic simulations of a binary suspension of stiff (s) and floppy (f) capsules, as well as a stochastic model that incorporates the key particle transport mechanisms in suspensions -- wall-induced hydrodynamic migration and shear-induced pair collisions. The stochastic model allows the relative importance of these two mechanisms to be directly evaluated and thereby indicates that margination, at least in the dilute case, is largely due to the differential dynamics of homogeneous (e.g. s-s) and heterogeneous (s-f) collisions
D1-251	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. This biochemical process, primarily carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, a vital energy source, and oxygen, a crucial element for respiration. The process unfolds in two stages: the light-dependent reactions, where sunlight splits water molecules, and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose. This remarkable process not only sustains life on Earth but also regulates the planet's oxygen levels and carbon cycle, underpinning the delicate balance of our ecosystems.
D1-252	We studied the curvature-driven roughening of a disk domain pattern with a variable interface window. The relaxation of interface is driven by negative surface tension . When a domain boundary propagates radially at a constant rate, we found that evolution of interface roughness follows scaling dynamic behavior. The local growth exponents are substantially different from the global exponents. Curvature-driven roughening belongs to a new class of anomalous roughening dynamics. However, a different surface tension leads to different global exponents. This is different from that of interface evolution with a fixed-size window, which has universal exponent. The variable growth window leads to a new class of anomalous roughening dynamics.
D1-253	 In the intricate world of botany, the carnivorous Venus flytrap captivates the imagination. This unique plant, native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina, traps insects to supplement its nutrients. Consisting of modified leaves arranged in a circular pattern, the trap snaps shut when an insect triggers sensitive hairs. The trap can open and close up to six times before exhausting its energy. This remarkable adaptation allows the Venus flytrap to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, showcasing nature's ingenious solutions to survival challenges.
D1-254	We have developed a mathematical model for in-host virus dynamics that includes spatial chemotaxis and diffusion across a two dimensional surface representing the vaginal or rectal epithelium at primary HIV infection. A linear stability analysis of the steady state solutions identified conditions for Turing instability pattern formation. We have solved the model equations numerically using parameter values obtained from previous experimental results for HIV infections. Simulations of the model for this surface show hot spots of infection. Understanding this localization is an important step in the ability to correctly model early HIV infection. These spatial variations also have implications for the development and effectiveness of microbicides against HIV.
D1-255	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating subject of study is the epigenetic modifications that influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, play crucial roles in regulating gene activity, often in response to environmental factors. For instance, during development, epigenetic changes dictate the transformation of a single fertilized egg into a complex organism with specialized cells. Similarly, exposure to toxins, diet, or stress can induce epigenetic changes that may increase the risk of diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding epigenetics provides valuable insights into hereditary traits and disease susceptibility, opening doors for potential therapeutic approaches that target these modifications rather than the genes themselves.
D1-256	Using a network representation for real soil samples and mathematical models for microbial spread, we show that the structural heterogeneity of the soil habitat may have a very significant influence on the size of microbial invasions of the soil pore space. In particular, neglecting the soil structural heterogeneity may lead to a substantial underestimation of microbial invasion. Such effects are explained in terms of a crucial interplay between heterogeneity in microbial spread and heterogeneity in the topology of soil networks. The main influence of network topology on invasion is linked to the existence of long channels in soil networks that may act as bridges for transmission of microorganisms between distant parts of soil.
D1-257	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, powering the planet's ecosystems. This biochemical miracle, performed by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis not only fuels the growth and survival of these organisms but also sustains the world's diverse fauna by producing the oxygen they breathe. Furthermore, it sequesters carbon dioxide, mitigating its harmful effects on the atmosphere and playing a crucial role in regulating climate. The process of photosynthesis, therefore, serves as a vital bridge between Earth's energy source (sunlight) and the food web that supports life on our planet.
D1-258	The scaling of transient times to zero-lag synchronization in networks composed of excitable units is shown to be governed by three features of the graph representing the network: the longest path between pairs of neurons (diameter), the largest loop (circumference) and the loop with the maximal average out degree. The upper bound of transient times can vary between O(1) and O(N2), where N is the size of the network, and its scaling can be predicted in many scenarios from finite time accumulated information of the transient. Results challenge the assumption that functionality of neural networks might depend solely upon the synchronized repeated activation such as zero-lag synchronization.
D1-259	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single base pair mutation can have profound effects on an organism. For instance, the sickle cell trait, a genetic variation in the beta-globin gene, provides some resistance against malaria but can lead to health complications. This illustrates the delicate balance between genetic variations and their consequences. On the other hand, polygenic inheritance, the transmission of traits influenced by multiple genes, adds complexity. Consider the variation in human height, which is influenced by numerous genes, each contributing a small effect, highlighting the interplay of multiple factors in determining an organism's traits. These examples underscore the intricate dance of genetics, where slight alterations can lead to significant differences, and where understanding the intricacies can shed light on diseases and potentially pave the way for targeted treatments.
D1-260	Combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayer systems of varying chemical composition with single-trajectory analyses we systematically elucidate the stochastic nature of the lipid motion. We observe subdiffusion over more than four orders of magnitude in time, clearly stretching into the sub-microsecond domain. The lipid motion delicately depends on the lipid chemistry, the lipid phase, and especially on the presence of cholesterol. We demonstrate that fractional Langevin equation motion universally describes the lipid motion in all phases including the gel phase, and in the presence of cholesterol. The results underline the relevance of anomalous diffusion in lipid bilayers and the strong effects of the membrane composition.
D1-261	 Diving deeper into genetics, the mystery of genetic expression unfolds. Genes, the basic units of heredity, are segments of DNA that carry instructions for protein synthesis. However, not all genes are expressed at the same time or in the same cells. This selective expression, known as gene regulation, is crucial for the development and functioning of an organism. Environmental factors, epigenetic modifications, and transcription factors play pivotal roles in determining which genes are expressed, thus influencing traits and behaviors. Furthermore, the study of epigenetics uncovers additional layers of genetic complexity, revealing that the same DNA sequence can lead to different outcomes in different individuals, underlining the intricate dance of nature and nurture.
D1-262	In a multicellular organism different cell types express a gene in different amounts. Samples from which gene expression levels can be measured typically contain a mixture of different cell types, the resulting measurements thus give only averages over the different cell types present. Based on fluctuations in the mixture proportions from sample to sample it is in principle possible to reconstruct the underlying expression levels of each cell type: to deconvolute the sample. We use a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of deconvoluting such partial concentrations from mixed samples, give analytical results for when and how well samples can be unmixed, and suggest an algorithm for sample deconvolution.
D1-263	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. It enlightens us on the layers of complexity beyond DNA sequences. Epigenetics involves modifications like methylation and acetylation, which influence gene expression without changing the actual DNA code. These modifications, often affected by environmental factors, can be passed down from cell to cell, and in some instances, even across generations. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment sheds light on the intricate mechanisms behind hereditary traits and the potential for nurture to shape nature. Epigenetics, thus, offers promising avenues for understanding and potentially influencing the development of diseases and traits, bridging the gap between genetics and lifestyle factors.
D1-264	In this essay we elaborate on recent evidence demonstrating the presence of a second order phase transition in human brain dynamics and discuss its consequences for theoretical approaches to brain function. We review early evidence of criticality in brain dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales, and we stress how it was necessary to unify concepts and analysis techniques across scales to introduce the adequate order and control parameters which define the transition. A discussion on the relation between structural vs. dynamical complexity exposes future steps to understand the dynamics of the connectome (structure) from which emerges the cognitome (function).
D1-265	 In the captivating world of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish illuminate the deep-sea abyss. These gelatinous wonders, such as the Aequorea victoria, emit a soft, ethereal glow, a result of a complex protein called green fluorescent protein (GFP). This protein, when excited by blue light, emits a greenish hue, serving as a natural light source in the darkness of the ocean depths. This phenomenon is not merely a visual spectacle. it also plays a crucial role in the jellyfish's survival, as it can confuse predators or attract prey. The bioluminescent jellyfish, with their enchanting glow and intriguing adaptations, continue to fascinate scientists and viewers alike, offering a glimpse into the extraordinary diversity of life in our oceans.
D1-266	We introduce a system of light driven microscopic autonomous moving particles that move on a flat surface. The design is simple, yet effective: Micrometer sized objects with wedge shape are produced by photopolymerization, they are covered with a reflective surface. When the area of motion is illuminated perpendicularly from above, the light is deflected to the side by the wedge shaped objects, in the direction determined by the position and orientation of the particles. The momentum change during reflection provides the driving force for an effectively autonomous motion. The system is an efficient tool to study self propelled microscopic robots.
D1-267	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process, sustaining life on Earth. This miraculous biochemical reaction, performed primarily by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Through a series of complex reactions, chlorophyll, the green pigment found in chloroplasts, absorbs light energy, catalyzing the production of ATP and NADPH. These energy carriers drive the reduction of carbon dioxide to glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital cycle not only fuels plant growth but also oxygenates the atmosphere, making Earth habitable for diverse forms of life.
D1-268	We introduce a system for experimental evolution consisting of populations of short oligonucleotides (Oli populations) evolving in a modified quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). It is tractable at the genetic, genomic, phenotypic and fitness levels. The Oli system uses DNA hairpins designed to form structures that self-prime under defined conditions. Selection acts on the phenotype of self-priming, after which differences in fitness are amplified and quantified using qPCR. We outline the methodological and bioinformatics tools for the Oli system here, and demonstrate that it can be used as a conventional experimental evolution model system by test-driving it in an experiment investigating adaptive evolution under different rates of environmental change.
D1-269	 In the intricate world of genetics, a fascinating phenomenon known as genetic recombination unfolds. During sexual reproduction, the pairing of homologous chromosomes results in this process. Genetic recombination occurs when segments of genetic material are exchanged between the parent chromosomes, generating genetic diversity in offspring. This exchange occurs in the form of crossover events during prophase I of meiosis, where the four chromatids align and exchange segments. In essence, genetic recombination is the engine of evolution, ensuring the survival and adaptability of species by producing offspring with unique genetic combinations, a testament to nature's ingenious design for promoting diversity and resilience.
D1-270	Invasion waves are a fundamental building block of theoretical ecology. In this study we aim to take the first steps to link propagation failure and fast acceleration of traveling waves to critical transitions (or tipping points). The approach is based upon a detailed numerical study of various versions of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation. The main motivation of this work is to contribute to the following question: how much information do statistics, collected by a stationary observer, contain about the speed and bifurcations of traveling waves? We suggest warning signs based upon closeness to carrying capacity, second-order moments and transients of localized initial invasions.
D1-271	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics sheds light on a fascinating layer of biological regulation. Epigenetics, quite simply, refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. Instead, these modifications occur at the molecular level, through chemical tags that switch genes on or off, responding to various environmental factors. Epigenetic changes can influence traits such as aging, cancer development, and susceptibility to diseases, offering insights into potential avenues for prevention and treatment. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity and adaptability of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-272	We investigate the microtubule polymerization dynamics with catastrophe and rescue events for three different confinement scenarios, which mimic typical cellular environments: (i) The microtubule is confined by rigid and fixed walls, (ii) it grows under constant force, and (iii) it grows against an elastic obstacle with a linearly increasing force. We use realistic catastrophe models and analyze the microtubule dynamics, the resulting microtubule length distributions, and force generation by stochastic and mean field calculations. in addition, we perform stochastic simulations. We also investigate the force dynamics if growth parameters are perturbed in dilution experiments. Finally, we show the robustness of our results against changes of catastrophe models and load distribution factors.
D1-273	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role. These organelles generate ATP, the primary energy currency, through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This intricate process occurs inside the inner mitochondrial membrane, where a series of proteins, collectively known as complexes, work in harmony to harness chemical energy stored in nutrients and convert it into ATP. The structure of mitochondria reflects this function, with a double membrane and cristae, which increase the surface area for energy production. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can lead to a variety of diseases, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular health.
D1-274	We report the imaging of tendon, a connective tissue rich in collagen type I proteins, with Interferometric Second Harmonic Generation (I-SHG) microscopy. We observed that the noncentrosymmetric structural organization can be maintained along the fibrillar axis over more than 150 {\mu}m, while in the transverse direction it is ~1-15 {\mu}m. Those results are explained by modeling tendon as a heterogeneous distribution of noncentrosymmetric nanocylinders (collagen fibrils) oriented along the fibrillar axis. The preservation of the noncentrosymmetric structural organization over multiple tens of microns reveals that tendon is made of domains in which the fraction occupied by fibrils oriented in one direction is larger than in the other.
D1-275	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role in energy production through a process known as cellular respiration. These organelles absorb nutrients from the cell's cytoplasm, converting them into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the universal energy currency of the cell. Mitochondria also play a crucial role in cell signaling, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and even in regulating the cell's response to oxidative stress. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the nucleus, hinting at an intriguing evolutionary history where these organelles may have originated as free-living bacteria that were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells.
D1-276	Calcium dynamics is the highly responsible for intracellular electrical (action potential) and chemical (neurotransmitter) signaling in neuron cell. The Mathematical modeling of calcium dynamics in neurons lead to the reaction diffusion equation which involves the parameters like diffusion coefficient, free calcium, bound calcium, buffers and bound buffer. Here the parameters like receptors, serca and leak are also incorporated in the model. Appropriate boundary conditions have been framed based on biophysical conditions of the problem. The finite volume method has been employed to obtain the solution. The computer program has been developed using MATLAB 7.11 for the entire problem to compute Ca2+ profiles and study the relationships among various parameters.
D1-277	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the scientific landscape. This innovative tool, derived from bacterial immune systems, allows precise modifications to DNA sequences. By targeting specific genetic mutations, it offers the potential to correct inherited diseases, enhance crop resistance to pests, and even combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This technology, however, raises ethical questions about genetic manipulation, the potential for designer babies, and the long-term effects on biological diversity. As we navigate this promising yet complex territory, it's crucial to balance the benefits with responsible use and rigorous ethical considerations.
D1-278	Mechanical forces such as fluid shear have been shown to enhance cell growth and differentiation, but knowledge of their mechanistic effect on cells is limited because the local flow patterns and associated metrics are not precisely known. Here we present real-time, noninvasive measures of local hydrodynamics in 3D biomaterials based on nuclear magnetic resonance. Microflow maps were further used to derive pressure, shear and fluid permeability fields. Finally, remodeling of collagen gels in response to precise fluid flow parameters was correlated with structural changes. It is anticipated that accurate flow maps within 3D matrices will be a critical step towards understanding cell behavior in response to controlled flow dynamics.
D1-279	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the mutation of genes plays a pivotal role in evolution and disease. A mutation is an alteration in a gene's sequence, which can be caused by various factors such as errors during DNA replication, exposure to mutagenic agents, or radiation. These changes can result in the production of abnormal or nonfunctional proteins. Some mutations are harmless, while others can have profound effects on an organism, leading to genetic disorders or increased susceptibility to diseases. Conversely, beneficial mutations can lead to adaptations that enhance survival, driving the process of evolution. The study of mutations offers invaluable insights into our understanding of heredity, genetic disorders, and the origin of species.
D1-280	We investigate the relationship between communication and search efficiency in a biological context by proposing a model of Brownian searchers with long-range pairwise interaction. After a general study of the properties of the model, we show an application to the particular case of acoustic communication among Mongolian gazelle, for which data are available, searching for good habitat areas. Using Monte Carlo simulations and density equations, our results point out that the search is optimal (i.e. the mean first hitting time among searchers is minimum) at intermediate scales of communication, showing that both an excess and a lack of information may worsen it.
D1-281	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or 'firefly squid', exhibits an extraordinary display of light. This small, elusive cephalopod dwells in the deep sea, using its light-producing organs, or photophores, to communicate, confuse predators, and attract prey. The squid's light emission is generated by a chemical reaction within the photophores, which involve a protein called 'aequorin' and the calcium-binding protein 'green fluorescent protein' (GFP). These proteins, when stimulated, emit a blue-green light that contributes to the squid's mesmerizing display, shedding light on the marvels of bioluminescence in the deep sea.
D1-282	Genetic redundancy is ubiquitous and can be found in any organism. However, it has been argued that genetic redundancy reduces total population fitness, and therefore, redundancy is unlikely to evolve. In this letter, we study an evolutionary model with high-dimensional genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM) to investigate the relevance of complexity in GPM to the evolution of genetic redundancy. By applying the replica method to deal with quenched randomness, the redundancy dependence of the fitness is analytically obtained, which demonstrates that genetic redundancy can indeed evolve, provided that the GPM is complex. Our result provides a novel insight into how genetic redundancy evolves.
D1-283	 In marine ecosystems, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) plays a pivotal role. This colossal brown seaweed, often reaching heights of up to 165 feet, thrives in nutrient-rich, cold waters. It forms vast underwater forests that provide shelter and food for an array of marine life, from tiny shrimp to mammoth sea otters. The kelp forest's intricate structure also serves as a nursery for fish, helping to maintain biodiversity. Furthermore, this seaweed absorbs carbon dioxide, making it a crucial component in the fight against climate change. However, overfishing and anthropogenic activities threaten these underwater forests, underscoring the need for conservation efforts to preserve the delicate balance of our oceans.
D1-284	In this letter, we present an original demonstration of an associative learning neural network inspired by the famous Pavlov's dogs experiment. A single nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor (NOMFET) is used to implement each synapse. We show how the physical properties of this dynamic memristive device can be used to perform low power write operations for the learning and implement short-term association using temporal coding and spike timing dependent plasticity based learning. An electronic circuit was built to validate the proposed learning scheme with packaged devices, with good reproducibility despite the complex synaptic-like dynamic of the NOMFET in pulse regime.
D1-285	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 technology is revolutionizing our ability to manipulate DNA sequences. This powerful tool allows precise editing of gene structures, opening doors for extensive research and potential treatments in numerous fields, such as agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. By employing short RNA sequences to find and cut specific DNA sites, scientists can insert, delete, or alter segments of DNA with remarkable accuracy. This breakthrough technology offers hope for the eradication of genetic diseases, development of crop resistance to pests, and advancement of scientific understanding of the building blocks of life. The future of genetics is undeniably intertwined with the potential of CRISPR-Cas9.
D1-286	The distribution of Red Blood Cells in a confined channel flow is inhomogeneous and shows a marked depletion near the walls due to a competition between migration away from the walls and shear-induced diffusion resulting from interactions between particles. We investigated the lift of RBCs in a shear flow near a wall and measured a significant lift velocity despite the tumbling motion of cells. We also provide values for the collective and anisotropic shear-induced diffusion of a cloud of RBCs, both in the direction of shear and in the direction of vorticity. A generic down-gradient subdiffusion characterized by an exponent 1/3 is highlighted.
D1-287	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a captivating phenomenon. This mutualistic relationship, often observed between diverse species, exemplifies nature's balance. For instance, consider the relationship between coral polyps and algae, known as zooxanthellae. Corals provide the algae with a safe haven and essential nutrients, while the algae convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, providing the coral with vital sugars and oxygen. This symbiotic partnership supports the vibrant, complex coral reef ecosystems, teeming with life. Similarly, the relationship between termites and protozoa in their digestive systems allows termites to break down cellulose, aiding their survival in wooded environments. Such symbiotic relationships underscore the interconnectedness of life on our planet, highlighting the intricate web of dependencies that sustain diverse ecosystems.
D1-288	The application of newly developed first-principle modeling techniques to liquid water deepens our understanding of the microscopic origins of its unusual macroscopic properties and behaviour. Here, we review two novel ab initio computational methods: second-generation Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics and decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals. We show that these two methods in combination not only enable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on previously inaccessible time and length scales, but also provide unprecedented insights into the nature of hydrogen bonding between water molecules. We discuss recent applications of these methods to water clusters and bulk water.
D1-289	 In the realm of genetic diversity, the study of centromeres, the constriction regions on chromosomes essential for cell division, offers fascinating insights. Centromeres, though devoid of genes, are rich in repetitive DNA sequences, making them challenging to study. Yet, they play a crucial role in ensuring accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division, a process vital to life. Variations in centromere structure and function contribute to genetic differences among species, highlighting their significant role in evolution. The intricate dance of chromosomes, choreographed by centromeres, orchestrates the symphony of life, subtly weaving the threads of diversity among organisms.
D1-290	Left- and right-handed helical modes' statistical absolute equilibria appear \textit{separately}. If both chiral sectors present, one can dominate around its positive pole, which is relevant to the nearly maximally helical (force free for magnetic field) states of turbulence. Pure magnetodynamics (PMD, or electron magnetohydrodynamics --- EMHD), pure hydrodynamics (PHD), and, single-fluid and two-fluid MHDs are studied. Relevant documented data and issues of cascade properties, and, helical and nonhelical dynamos are revisited. We also discuss new scenarios, such as PMD inverse magnetic helicity and forward energy cascades, and, the continuous transition from completely-inverse to partly-inverse-and-partly-forward and to completely-forward energy transfers in PHD.
D1-291	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the Dumbo Octopus, exhibits an extraordinary display of light. Living at depths of over 600 meters, this soft-bodied cephalopod utilizes bioluminescent organs called photophores to communicate and camouflage in the dark abyssal environment. The light emitted is a result of a chemical reaction within the photophores, where the enzyme luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, producing light energy. This fascinating creature, with its large ear-like fins and bioluminescent abilities, continues to captivate scientists and inspire curiosity about the depths of our oceans.
D1-292	We study colonies of non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria growing on solid substrates. In our model, bacteria interact purely mechanically, by pushing each other away as they grow, and consume a diffusing nutrient. We show that mechanical interactions control the velocity and shape of the advancing front, which leads to features that cannot be captured by established Fisher-Kolmogorov models. In particular, we find that the velocity depends on the elastic modulus of bacteria or their stickiness to the surface. Interestingly, we predict that the radius of an incompressible, strictly two-dimensional colony cannot grow linearly in time. Importantly, mechanical interactions can also account for the nonequilibrium transition between circular and branching colonies, often observed in the lab.
D1-293	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly alter an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found within genes, can influence everything from eye color in humans to resistance to diseases in plants. SNPs, when analyzed in large populations, offer invaluable insights into genetic diversity, evolution, and the basis of heritable disorders. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, identified millions of these SNPs, paving the way for precision medicine, personalized diagnostics, and enhanced understanding of our genetic blueprint.
D1-294	We have considered as a theoretical possibility for the development of a nanobiochip the operation principle of which is based on measuring conductance in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. Calculations have demonstrated that in the majority of cases the conductance of double-stranded nucleotides considerably exceeds that of single-stranded ones. The results obtained are in agreement with recent experiments on measuring the oligonucleotide conductance. It has been shown that an electronic biochip containing 11 nucleotide pairs will recognize approximately 97% sequences. It has also been demonstrated that the percentage of identifiable sequences will grow with the sequence length.
D1-295	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the firefly squid, captivates scientists with its mesmerizing light displays. This cephalopod, found in the deep seas off the coast of Japan and New Zealand, emits a radiant blue glow from its fins and tentacles. The light is produced by a chemical reaction within specialized cells called photophores, which are filled with a bioluminescent protein called aequorin. This unique ability serves multiple purposes. the squid uses it to communicate, attract prey, and evade predators by blending into the dark environment or creating a distraction. The firefly squid's intricate light patterns reveal a complex social life, offering exciting insights into the mysterious world of deep-sea creatures.
D1-296	RNAs are negatively charged molecules residing in macromolecular crowding cellular environments. Macromolecular confinement can influence the ion effects in RNA folding. In this work, using the recently developed tightly bound ion model for ion fluctuation and correlation, we investigate the confinement effect on the ion-mediated RNA structural collapse for a simple model system. We found that, for both Na$^+$ and Mg$^{2+}$, ion efficiencies in mediating structural collapse/folding are significantly enhanced by the structural confinement. Such an enhancement in the ion efficiency is attributed to the decreased electrostatic free energy difference between the compact conformation ensemble and the (restricted) extended conformation ensemble due to the spatial restriction.
D1-297	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer atop DNA, alterations in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence itself, provides a dynamic landscape for biological functions. This phenomenon, influenced by factors such as environment, age, and lifestyle, can potentially explain why identical twins may develop distinct traits. It underscores the complexity of our genetic makeup, suggesting that nature and nurture are not mutually exclusive but intertwined, shaping our unique biological journeys. Epigenetic modifications, while reversible, have profound implications for our understanding of heredity, health, and disease.
D1-298	"In this work we propose a model for gene expression based on the theory of random dynamical systems (RDS) and show that it has a ""modularity property"" in the following sense: given any collection of genes that are linked in a transcriptional network, if each of them is individually described by a certain class of RDS then there is a natural, and essentially unique, prescription for coupling them together, respecting the network topology, in such a way that the collective system formed by all genes is a RDS as well. Moreover, the class of RDS used to describe the individual genes is flexible enough to account for a wide range of stochastic behaviors within the realm of stationary processes."
D1-299	" In the realm of genetics, a fascinating concept is gene expression. This process, a dance of DNA and proteins, governs how an organism's genes are ""read"" and translated into functional proteins. It's a complex interplay of various factors, including the structure of the DNA, the presence of regulatory elements, and the cellular environment. Environmental factors can also influence gene expression, a phenomenon known as epigenetics, which adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of heredity. This dynamic interplay between genes and their environment underscores the intricate symphony that is life, a symphony that, even in its most minute details, holds the key to understanding our existence."
D1-300	We apply formal measures of emergence, self-organization, homeostasis, autopoiesis and complexity to an aquatic ecosystem. in particular to the physiochemical component of an Arctic lake. These measures are based on information theory. Variables with an homogeneous distribution have higher values of emergence, while variables with a more heterogeneous distribution have a higher self-organization. Variables with a high complexity reflect a balance between change (emergence) and regularity/order (self-organization). In addition, homeostasis values coincide with the variation of the winter and summer seasons. Autopoiesis values show a higher degree of independence of biological components over their environment. Our approach shows how the ecological dynamics can be described in terms of information.
D1-301	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or Dinoflagellates, display a fascinating spectacle. These deep-sea dwellers emit a soft glow, harnessing chemical reactions within their bodies to produce light. This luminescence serves multiple purposes, including attracting prey, warding off predators, and facilitating communication among individuals. The glow, while seemingly magical, is a testament to the incredible adaptations that allow these creatures to thrive in the inky blackness of the deep ocean. Their light is not just captivating to human eyes, but also plays a crucial role in the complex ecosystems of the abyssal depths.
D1-302	The perceived pitch of a complex harmonic sound changes if the partials of the sound are frequency-shifted by a fixed amount. Simple mathematical rules that the perceived pitch could be expected to follow ('first pitch-shift') are violated in psychoacoustic experiments ('second pitchshift'). For this, commonly cognitive cortical processes were held responsible. Here, we show that human pitch perception can be reproduced from a minimal, purely biophysical, model of the cochlea, by fully recovering the psychoacoustical pitch-shift data of G.F. Smoorenburg (1970) and related physiological measurements from the cat cochlear nucleus. For this to happen, the cochlear fluid plays a distinguished role.
D1-303	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet, orchestrated by green plant life. Through this process, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight blend harmoniously to produce glucose and oxygen, the essence of life and the air we breathe. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, captures sunlight, converting it into energy. This energy fuels the splitting of water molecules, releasing hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the carbon dioxide is absorbed and transformed into glucose, a simple sugar that powers plant growth and serves as a foundation for food chains. Photosynthesis, therefore, links the realm of plants to the survival of all life forms on Earth, reaffirming the interconnectedness of our planet's ecosystems.
D1-304	The entropic effects of anchored polymers on biomembranes are studied using simulations of a meshless membrane model combined with anchored linear polymer chains. The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains. Our results are in good agreement with the previous theoretical predictions. It is found that the polymer reduces the line tension of membrane edges, as well as the interfacial line tension between membrane domains, leading to microdomain formation. Instead of the mixing of two phases as observed in typical binary fluids, densely anchored polymers stabilize small domains. A mean field theory is proposed for the edge line tension reduced by anchored ideal chains, which reproduces our simulation results well.
D1-305	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges, a fascinating study that explores changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily due to environmental factors, can be inherited, thus impacting our health and behavior across generations. Methylation, a key epigenetic process, involves adding a methyl group to DNA or its associated histones, thereby repressing or activating gene expression. This complex interplay between nature and nurture offers a new lens through which we can understand and potentially manipulate heritable traits, opening doors for novel therapeutic approaches and a deeper appreciation of our genetic legacy.
D1-306	The prevalence of long-lasting oscillatory signals in the 2d echo-spectroscopy of light-harvesting complexes has led to a search for possible mechanisms. We investigate how two causes of oscillatory signals are intertwined: (i) electronic coherences supporting delocalized wave-like motion, and (ii) narrow bands in the vibronic spectral density. To disentangle the vibronic and electronic contributions we introduce a time-windowed Fourier transform of the signal amplitude. We find that 2d spectra can be dominated by excitations of pathways which are absent in excitonic energy transport. This leads to an underestimation of the life-time of electronic coherences by 2d spectra.
D1-307	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, transforming sunlight's energy into chemical energy, fueling the Earth's biosphere. This process, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water, which are then converted into glucose and oxygen. This symphony of chemical reactions not only sustains the producers in the food chain but also provides the oxygen we breathe, making photosynthesis an indispensable life-sustaining process on our planet.
D1-308	Polypeptides can self-assemble into hierarchically organized fibrils consisting of a stack of individually folded polypeptides driven together by hydrophobic interaction. Using a coarse grained model, we systematically studied this self-assembly as a function of temperature and hydrophobicity of the residues on the outside of the building block. We find the self-assembly can occur via two different pathways - a random aggregation-folding route, and a templated-folding process - thus indicating a strong coupling between folding and assembly. The simulation results can explain experimental evidence that assembly through stacking of folded building blocks is rarely observed, at the experimental concentrations. The model thus provides a generic picture of hierarchical fibril formation.
D1-309	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of Archaea reveals fascinating insights. These single-celled organisms, distinct from Bacteria and Eukaryotes, thrive in extreme environments such as hot springs, deep-sea vents, and salt lakes. Archaea display unique cellular structures and genetic characteristics, challenging the traditional tree of life model. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan, and they employ lipids with isoprenoid chains to maintain structural integrity. Moreover, Archaea exhibit DNA replication strategies divergent from Bacteria and Eukaryotes, further highlighting their evolutionary distinctiveness. This microscopic life form, once a mere curiosity, now offers a wealth of knowledge about the origins of life and the adaptability of organisms under harsh conditions.
D1-310	To function as gene regulatory elements in response to environmental signals, riboswitches must adopt specific secondary structures on appropriate time scales. We employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to model the time-dependent folding during transcription of TPP riboswitch expression platforms. According to our simulations, riboswitch transcriptional terminators, which must adopt a specific hairpin configuration by the time they have been transcribed, fold with higher efficiency than Shine-Dalgarno sequesterers, whose proper structure is required only at the time of ribosomal binding. Our findings suggest both that riboswitch transcriptional terminator sequences have been naturally selected for high folding efficiency, and that sequesterers can maintain their function even in the presence of significant misfolding.
D1-311	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool, offering a precise and efficient method for editing DNA. This technology, derived from bacterial immune systems, allows scientists to target specific genes, correct genetic mutations, and even modify gene functions. The potential applications are vast, ranging from treating genetic diseases to enhancing crops for global food security. However, ethical considerations surrounding human gene editing remain a contentious issue, necessitating rigorous debate and careful regulation. As we delve deeper into the fascinating world of genetic engineering, the line between treatment and design becomes increasingly blurred, forcing us to reevaluate our moral and philosophical perspectives on the nature of humanity itself.
D1-312	In previous works, the author and collaborators establish a mathematical model for injury response in articular cartilage. In this paper we use mathematical software and computational techniques, applied to an existing model to explore in more detail how the behavior of cartilage cells is influenced by several of, what are believed to be, the most significant mechanisms underlying cartilage injury response at the cellular level. We introduce a control parameter, the radius of attenuation, and present some new simulations that shed light on how inflammation associated with cartilage injuries impacts the metabolic activity of cartilage cells. The details presented in the work can help to elucidate targets for more effective therapies in the preventative treatment of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
D1-313	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study revolves around epigenetics, an emerging field that delves into the modifications of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily through methylation and acetylation, can be influenced by factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. Epigenetic changes are crucial in regulating crucial biological processes, like cell differentiation and development, and are even linked to the transmission of learned behaviors in certain species. This dynamic interplay between gene, environment, and time opens up a world of possibilities for understanding complex traits and diseases, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies beyond traditional genetic approaches.
D1-314	"We study the average asymptotic growth rate of cells in randomly fluctuating environments, with multiple viable phenotypes per environment. We show that any information processing strategy has an asymptotic growth rate, which is the sum of: (i) the maximal growth rate at the worst possible distribution of environments, (ii) relative information between the actual distribution of environments to the worst one, and (iii) information utilization rate, which is the information rate of the sensory devices minus the ""information dissipation rate"", the amount of information not utilized by the cell for growth. In non-stationary environments, we find that the optimal phenotypic switching times equally partition the information dissipation rate between consecutive switching intervals."
D1-315	 In the captivating realm of biology, symbiosis, a delicate dance between different species, holds center stage. This intricate relationship, harmonious yet complex, benefits both parties. For instance, consider the relationship between coral and algae. Corals, stationary and dependent on a fixed location, host photosynthetic algae, zooxanthellae, within their tissues. The algae thrive on the coral's nutrient-rich environment while providing the coral with life-sustaining energy through photosynthesis. This mutualistic symbiosis enables the vibrant coral reefs to flourish, serving as vital habitats for countless marine species, thereby maintaining biodiversity and bolstering ecosystem stability. However, this delicate balance can be disrupted by environmental changes, such as ocean acidification and rising temperatures, threatening the very existence of these magnificent underwater metropolises.
D1-316	Regular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems are believed to arise from the interplay between long-range competition and facilitation processes acting at smaller distances. We show that, under rather general conditions, long-range competition alone may be enough to shape these patterns. To this end we propose a simple, general model for the dynamics of vegetation, which includes only long-range competition between plants. Competition is introduced through a nonlocal term, where the kernel function quantifies the intensity of the interaction. We recover the full spectrum of spatial structures typical of vegetation models that also account for facilitation in addition to competition.
D1-317	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study revolves around epigenetics, a field that explores changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, primarily DNA methylation and histone modification, play a crucial role in cellular processes, influencing gene activity without changing the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, offering a promising new avenue for understanding complex traits and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. This burgeoning field promises to revolutionize our understanding of heredity and health, bridging the gap between nature and nurture.
D1-318	We present an experimentally guided, bi-phasic, multi-species ionic gel model to compare and make quantitative predictions on the viscoelastic properties of healthy mucus versus Cystic-Fibrosis infected mucus. The mixture theory consists of the mucus (polymer phase) and water (solvent phase) as well as several different ions: H$^+$, Na$^+$, Cl$^-$ and Ca$^{2+}$. The model is calibrated with the experimental data of mucus diffusivities. Numerical studies reveal that the Donnan forces are the dominating mechanism driving the mucus swelling/deswelling transition. However, these transitions could be continuous or discontinuous, depending on the complex interplay between ionic bath concentrations, pH, polymer mass in the solvent and the average charge per monomer.
D1-319	 In marine ecosystems, the role of plankton, that tiny, drifting life form, is pivotal. Plankton, comprising phytoplankton (algae) and zooplankton (small animals), form the foundation of the oceanic food web. Photosynthetic phytoplankton convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into energy through photosynthesis, providing oxygen and food for organisms at higher trophic levels. Zooplankton feed on phytoplankton, serving as food for larger marine life such as fish and krill. This delicate balance supports diverse marine biodiversity, offering valuable ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. Threats to plankton populations, such as ocean warming, acidification, and pollution, could disrupt this intricate, interconnected system, potentially disrupting the health of marine ecosystems globally.
D1-320	The structural and dynamical properties of suspensions of self-propelled Brownian particles of spherical shape are investigated in three spatial dimensions. Our simulations reveal a phase separation into a dilute and a dense phase, above a certain density and strength of self-propulsion. The packing fraction of the dense phase approaches random close packing at high activity, yet the system remains fluid. Although no alignment mechanism exists in this model, we find long-lived cooperative motion of the particles in the dense regime. This behavior is probably due to an interface-induced sorting process. Spatial displacement correlation functions are nearly scale-free for systems with densities close to or above the glass transition density of passive systems.
D1-321	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, is the primary source of energy for life on Earth. Utilizing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, these organisms convert these elements into glucose and oxygen, a testament to nature's extraordinary efficiency. Photosynthesis not only fuels life on our planet but also regulates the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, thus maintaining a delicate balance crucial for survival. This process, a symphony of chemistry and light, is a testament to the complex beauty hidden within the smallest of organisms.
D1-322	"In bacteria, regulatory proteins search for a specific DNA binding target via ""facilitated diffusion"": a series of rounds of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm, and 1D linear diffusion along the DNA contour. Using large scale Brownian dynamics simulations we find that each of these steps is affected differently by crowding proteins, which can either be bound to the DNA acting as a road block to the 1D diffusion, or freely diffusing in the cytoplasm. Macromolecular crowding can strongly affect mechanistic features such as the balance between 3D and 1D diffusion, but leads to surprising robustness of the total search time."
D1-323	 In the intricate world of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, a spectral marvel, excels. These cephalopods, equipped with light-producing organs called photophores, can illuminate their environment with a mesmerizing glow. The purpose of this luminous display serves various functions, including signaling, camouflage, and attracting prey. Interestingly, the light is produced through a chemical reaction within the photophores, where the enzyme luciferin reacts with the enzyme luciferase in the presence of oxygen and ATP, resulting in a flash of blue, green, or red light. This spectacle of nature, a dance of darkness and light, continues to captivate scientists and onlookers alike, offering insights into the mysteries of life under the sea.
D1-324	Cluster analysis faces two problems in high dimensions: first, the `curse of dimensionality' that can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. and second, the sheer time taken for conventional algorithms to process large amounts of high-dimensional data. In many applications, only a small subset of features provide information about the cluster membership of any one data point, however this informative feature subset may not be the same for all data points. Here we introduce a `Masked EM' algorithm for fitting mixture of Gaussians models in such cases. We show that the algorithm performs close to optimally on simulated Gaussian data, and in an application of `spike sorting' of high channel-count neuronal recordings.
D1-325	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of genetic expression unfolds a captivating tale. Genes, the basic units of heredity, are not static entities but dynamic ones. They are transcribed into messenger RNA, which journeys to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs. This process, known as translation, constructs proteins, the building blocks of life, shaping an organism's structure and function. Environmental factors, such as temperature and nutrient availability, can influence gene expression, providing an intricate dance between nature and nurture in the grand symphony of life. This intricate dance underscores the profound complexity and adaptability inherent in living organisms.
D1-326	Nanodiamonds (NDs) containing silicon vacancy (SiV) defects were evaluated as a potential biomarker for the labeling and fluorescent imaging of neural precursor cells (NPCs). SiV-containing NDs were synthesized using chemical vapor deposition and silicon ion implantation. Spectrally, SiV-containing NDs exhibited extremely stable fluorescence and narrow bandwidth emission with an excellent signal to noise ratio exceeding that of NDs containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. NPCs labeled with NDs exhibited normal cell viability and proliferative properties consistent with biocompatibility. We conclude that SiVcontaining NDs are a promising biomedical research tool for cellular labeling and optical imaging in stem cell research.
D1-327	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known scientifically as Dinofelis gymnocaeca, is an intriguing deep-sea creature. It produces light through a chemical reaction within specialized cells, a trait used for communication, predator evasion, and locating food in the dark abyss. This squid's unique bioluminescent patterns are believed to serve as camouflage against predators, as they can mimic the glowing plankton that often surrounds them. Remarkably, these creatures can also synchronize their flashes when in a group, creating mesmerizing visual displays that add to the mystery of the deep sea.
D1-328	In the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model of disease spreading, the time to extinction of the epidemics happens at an intermediate value of the per-contact transmission probability. Too contagious infections burn out fast in the population. Infections that are not contagious enough die out before they spread to a large fraction of people. We characterize how the maximal extinction time in SIR simulations on networks depend on the network structure. For example we find that the average distances in isolated components, weighted by the component size, is a good predictor of the maximal time to extinction. Furthermore, the transmission probability giving the longest outbreaks is larger than, but otherwise seemingly independent of, the epidemic threshold.
D1-329	" In the intricate world of cellular biology, mitochondria play a pivotal role. Often dubbed as the ""powerhouses"" of cells, mitochondria are responsible for generating most of the energy needed for cellular functions. They achieve this through a process known as cellular respiration, converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. Mitochondria's significance is further underscored by their role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death, acting as essential regulators in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Moreover, they are critical in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters and heme groups, integral components in various proteins and enzymes. The dynamic evolution of mitochondria, from being free-living organisms to becoming intracellular symbionts, is a fascinating testament to the adaptability and interconnectedness of life on Earth."
D1-330	The theoretical and experimental study of energy transfer in photosynthesis has revealed an interesting transport regime, which lies at the borderline between classical transport dynamics and quantum-mechanical interference effects. Dissipation is caused by the coupling of electronic degrees of freedom to vibrational modes and leads to a directional energy transfer from the antenna complex to the target reaction-center. The dissipative driving is robust and does not rely on fine-tuning of specific vibrational modes. For the parameter regime encountered in the biological systems new theoretical tools are required to directly compare theoretical results with experimental spectroscopy data. The calculations require to utilize massively parallel graphics processor units (GPUs) for efficient and exact computations.
D1-331	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics offers intriguing insights. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These changes can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle choices. For instance, stress or diet can cause epigenetic changes that may impact an organism's health and disease susceptibility. Epigenetics, therefore, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, providing a compelling explanation for how experiences can shape our biological makeup. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of life and opens doors for potential therapeutic interventions.
D1-332	We propose a new look at the heat bath for two Brownian particles, in which the heat bath as a `system' is both perturbed and sensed by the Brownian particles. Non-local thermal fluctuation give rise to bath-mediated static forces between the particles. Based on the general sum-rule of the linear response theory, we derive an explicit relation linking these forces to the friction kernel describing the particles' dynamics. The relation is analytically confirmed in the case of two solvable models and could be experimentally challenged. Our results point out that the inclusion of the environment as a part of the whole system is important for micron- or nano-scale physics.
D1-333	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a fundamental ballet. Plants, algae, and some bacteria, the verdant choreographers, harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen in a symphony of chemical reactions. This process, fueled by solar power, nourishes the planet and sustains all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is not only a testament to nature's ingenious design but also a poignant reminder of our dependence on these green performers for our very existence.
D1-334	We assess electrical brain dynamics before, during, and after one-hundred human epileptic seizures with different anatomical onset locations by statistical and spectral properties of functionally defined networks. We observe a concave-like temporal evolution of characteristic path length and cluster coefficient indicative of a movement from a more random toward a more regular and then back toward a more random functional topology. Surprisingly, synchronizability was significantly decreased during the seizure state but increased already prior to seizure end. Our findings underline the high relevance of studying complex systems from the view point of complex networks, which may help to gain deeper insights into the complicated dynamics underlying epileptic seizures.

This groundbreaking technology allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences, opening doors to countless possibilities. From eradicating genetic diseases to enhancing agricultural productivity, CRISPR's potential is vast. However, ethical considerations loom large, as questions about human germline editing and the potential for designer babies engulf the scientific community. Balancing the promise of cure with the fear of unintended consequences, the future of CRISPR-Cas9 lies in careful deliberation, thoughtful application, and strict regulatory oversight.
D1-336	The mechanism allowing a protein to search of a target sequence on DNA is currently described as an intermittent process composed of 3D diffusion in bulk and 1D diffusion along the DNA molecule. Due to the relevant charge of protein and DNA, electrostatic interaction should play a crucial role during this search. In this paper, we explicitly derive the mean field theory allowing for a description of the protein-DNA electrostatics in solution. This approach leads to a unified model of the search process, where 1D and 3D diffusion appear as a natural consequence of the diffusion on an extended interaction energy profile.

The ethical and societal implications are vast, urging careful consideration as we stride into this new era of genetic manipulation. Future advancements could lead to personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, ultimately improving health outcomes and quality of life.
D1-338	Viruses are biological nanosystems with a capsid of protein-made capsomer units that encloses and protects the genetic material responsible for their replication. Here we show how the geometrical constraints of the capsomer-capsomer interaction in icosahedral capsids fix the form of the shortest and universal truncated multipolar expansion of the two-body interaction between capsomers. The structures of many of the icosahedral and related virus capsids are located as single lowest energy states of this potential energy surface. Our approach unveils relevant features of the natural design of the capsids and can be of interest in fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology where similar hollow convex structures are relevant.
D1-339	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Unlike DNA sequences, which remain relatively stable, epigenetic modifications dynamically alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA structure. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are influenced by various factors including age, environment, and lifestyle choices. Epigenetics provides a fascinating understanding of how external factors can impact biological functions, contributing to complex traits and even diseases like cancer. The study of epigenetics bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering compelling insights into the intricate dance between our genes and the world around us.
D1-340	Complex networks are intrinsically modular. Resolving small modules is particularly difficult when the network is densely connected. wide variation of link weights invites additional complexities. In this article we present an algorithm to detect community structure in densely connected weighted networks. First, modularity of the network is calculated by erasing the links having weights smaller than a cutoff $q.$ Then one takes all the disjoint components obtained at $q=q_c,$ where the modularity is maximum, and modularize the components individually using Newman Girvan's algorithm for weighted networks. We show, taking microRNA (miRNA) co-target network of Homo sapiens as an example, that this algorithm could reveal miRNA modules which are known to be relevant in biological context.
D1-341	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis, a process essential to life on Earth, unfolds. This process, carried out by plants and certain organisms, transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere sustains a majority of life forms on our planet. Photosynthesis not only provides energy but also plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, helping to regulate Earth's climate. The complexity of this process, spanning photophosphorylation, electron transport, and carbon fixation, is a testament to nature's intricate design and the profound interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-342	The minimal ecological requirements for formation of regular vegetation patterns in semiarid systems have been recently questioned. Against the general belief that a combination of facilitative and competitive interactions is necessary, recent theoretical studies suggest that, under broad conditions, nonlocal competition among plants alone may induce patterns. In this paper, we review results along this line, presenting a series of models that yield spatial patterns when finite-range competition is the only driving force. A preliminary derivation of this type of model from a more detailed one that considers water-biomass dynamics is also presented. Keywords: Vegetation patterns, nonlocal interactions
D1-343	 In the intricate dance of evolution, the humble tardigrade, a microscopic organism, stands out as a testament to resilience. Capable of withstanding extremes that would render most life forms extinct, these eight-legged wonders can survive in vacuum, radiation, and temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to boiling point. Their secret lies in a unique protein, known as Dsup, which shields their DNA from damage. This diminutive creature, often referred to as the 'water bear,' offers biologists tantalizing clues about the limits of life on Earth and possibly beyond. Its tenacity and adaptability continue to inspire awe and fuel scientific curiosity.
D1-344	We apply here the principle of affine symmetry to the nested fullerene cages (carbon onions) that arise in the context of carbon chemistry. Previous work on affine extensions of the icosahedral group has revealed a new organisational principle in virus structure and assembly. We adapt this group theoretic framework here to the physical requirements dictated by carbon chemistry, and show that we can derive mathematical models for carbon onions within this affine symmetry approach. This suggests the applicability of affine symmetry in a wider context in Nature, as well as offering a novel perspective on the geometric principles underpinning carbon chemistry.
D1-345	 In botany, photosynthesis is a fundamental process, where green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy to fuel growth and development. This biochemical reaction takes place in organelles called chloroplasts and involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water. Through a series of complex reactions, including the Calvin cycle and the light-dependent reactions, glucose molecules are synthesized, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it forms the basis of the food chain and regulates our planet's oxygen levels.
D1-346	The way for performing multiple sequence alignment is based on the criterion of the maximum scored information content computed from a weight matrix, but it is possible to have two or more alignments to have the same highest score leading to ambiguities in selecting the best alignment. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the concept of joint weight matrix to eliminate the randomness in selecting the best multiple sequence alignment. Alignments with equal scores are iteratively rescored with the joint weight matrix of increasing level (nucleotide pairs, triplets and so on) until one single best alignment is eventually found. This method for resolving ambiguity in multiple sequence alignment can be easily implemented by use of the improved scoring matrix.
D1-347	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a marvelous dance of protein enzymes and nucleotides. This intricate process, essential for cell division and genetic continuity, begins with the separation of the double helix strands. A protein complex called the replication fork moves along the separated strands, acting as a platform for the synthesis of new DNA strands. Each strand serves as a template for the creation of its complementary strand, with nucleotides joining together through hydrogen bonds, thereby recreating the original double helix structure. This miraculous dance of life ensures the uninterrupted transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.
D1-348	This work asks how light harvesting in photosynthetic systems can be optimised for economically scalable, sustainable energy production. Hierarchy theory is introduced as a system-analysis and optimisation tool better able to handle multiscale, multiprocess complexities in photosynthetic energetics compared with standard linear-process analysis. Within this framework, new insights are given into relationships between composition, structure and energetics at the scale of the thylakoid membrane, and also into how components at different scales cooperate under functional objectives of the whole photosynthetic system. Combining these reductionistic and holistic analyses creates a platform for modelling multiscale-optimal, idealised photosynthetic systems in silico.
D1-349	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter an organism's genetic makeup. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found across the genome, play pivotal roles in determining distinct traits and predisposing individuals to various diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, a variant in the BRCA1 gene elevates the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women. As we delve deeper into the human genome, the vast potential for personalized medicine becomes increasingly evident, tailoring treatment strategies to an individual's unique genetic profile.
D1-350	Network measures that reflect the most salient properties of complex large-scale networks are in high demand in the network research community. In this paper we adapt a combinatorial measure of negative curvature (also called hyperbolicity) to parameterized finite networks, and show that a variety of biological and social networks are hyperbolic. This hyperbolicity property has strong implications on the higher-order connectivity and other topological properties of these networks. Specifically, we derive and prove bounds on the distance among shortest or approximately shortest paths in hyperbolic networks. We describe two implications of these bounds to cross-talk in biological networks, and to the existence of central, influential neighborhoods in both biological and social networks.
D1-351	 In the realm of botany, the intricate symbiosis between Mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots significantly enhances nutrient absorption. These fungi extend their filamentous structures, called hyphae, into the soil, creating an extensive network that facilitates the uptake of essential minerals, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, which are otherwise inaccessible to plants. In return, the plants provide the fungi with carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis. This harmonious relationship, often referred to as the 'hidden half' of the plant, plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance and promoting healthy plant growth in various terrestrial environments.
D1-352	We analyze fluctuations of particle displacements and stresses in a sheared athermal suspension of elastic capsules (red blood cells). Upon variation of the volume fraction from the dilute up to the highly concentrated regime, our numerical simulations reveal different characteristic power-law regimes of the fluctuation variances and relaxation times. In the jammed phase and at high shear rates, anomalous scaling exponents are found that deviate from pure dimensional predictions. The observed behavior is rationalized via kinetic arguments and a dissipation balance model that takes into account the local fluid flows between the particles. Our findings support the view that the rheology of dense suspensions is essentially governed by the non-affine displacements.

By harnessing the power of guide RNAs, scientists can direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific gene locations, facilitating corrections or deletions. This groundbreaking method holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, ethical considerations and potential unforeseen consequences require careful deliberation, ensuring this double-edged sword is wielded with wisdom and foresight.
D1-354	A wide range of networked systems exhibit highly connected nodes (hubs) as prominent structural elements. The functional roles of hubs in the collective nonlinear dynamics of many such networks, however, are not well understood. Here we propose that hubs in neural circuits may activate local signal transmission along sequences of specific subnetworks. Intriguingly, in contrast to previous suggestions of the functional roles of hubs, here not the hubs themselves, but non-hub subnetworks transfer the signals. The core mechanism relies on hubs and non-hubs providing activating feedback to each other. It may thus induce the propagation of specific pulse and rate signals in neuronal and other communication networks.
D1-355	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, the mitochondria, often dubbed the cell's powerhouse, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for generating ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, through a series of respiratory processes. Mitochondria also maintain calcium homeostasis and are implicated in various cellular signaling pathways. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own DNA, distinct from the nucleus, which encodes essential components of the organelle. This dual genetic system, a remnant of endosymbiotic evolution, underscores the complex and interdependent nature of cellular life.
D1-356	Ecologists are interested in understanding and predicting how ecological communities change through time. While it might seem natural to measure this through changes in species' abundances, computational limitations mean transitions between community types are often modelled instead. We present an approach inspired by DNA substitution models that attempts to estimate historic interactions between species, and thus estimate turnover rates in ecological communities. Although our simulations show that the method has some limitations, our application to butterfly community data shows the method can detect signal in real data. Open source C++ code implementing the method is available at http://www.github.com/willpearse/lotto.
D1-357	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, essentially, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, can be inherited, shaping an individual's development and health. For instance, exposure to certain chemicals can lead to epigenetic changes that increase the risk of diseases like cancer. The field of epigenetics offers promising avenues for understanding complex traits, disease susceptibility, and even potential therapeutic strategies. It's a fascinating intersection of genetics, environment, and development, revealing how our genes can be influenced by more than just our DNA sequence.
D1-358	The Phylogenetic Genome Annotator (PGA) is a computer program that enables real-time comparison of 'gene trees' versus 'species trees' obtained from predicted open reading frames of whole genome data. The gene phylogenies are inferred for each individual genome predicted proteins whereas the species phylogenies are inferred from rDNA data. The correlated protein domains, defined by PFAM, are then displayed side-by-side with a phylogeny of the corresponding species. The statistical support of gene clusters (branches) is given by the quartet puzzling method. This analysis readily discriminates paralogs from orthologs, enabling the identification of proteins originated by gene duplications and the prediction of possible functional divergence in groups of similar sequences.
D1-359	 In the realm of marine biology, the ocean sunfish, also known as Mola mola, showcases an intriguing adaptation. Weighing up to 2,200 pounds, these creatures have evolved a unique body structure, resembling a pancake with fins. This unusual form allows them to maneuver more efficiently in water, utilizing their dorsal and anal fins for propulsion and steering. Despite their immense size, their diet primarily consists of jellyfish and small plankton, which they filter from the water using their mouths lined with thousands of tiny bones. Remarkably, the ocean sunfish is also known to leap out of the water, though the purpose behind this behavior remains a fascinating mystery in marine biology.
D1-360	A hypothesis of singleness of the growth equation for biological objects on different organizational levels and dimensional analysis are used in order to substantiate Schmalhausen's model of ontogenetic growth (the mass of a growing organism is a power function of time). It is stated that such a model is valid only in the initial period of growth. For the whole period of growth, a generalization of Schmalhausen's model is advanced. it provides the same accuracy as previously known models of quantitative description of kinetic curves. Within the scope of the developed model, a number of interesting results related to an allometry and biological time are obtained.
D1-361	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining the very foundation of our planet. This biological marvel, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This transformation is a testament to the incredible efficiency of nature, providing the world with essential energy and breathable air, thereby maintaining the delicate balance necessary for life to thrive. Photosynthesis is a continuous cycle of creativity, a dance between energy and matter, a symphony of life played out on a global scale. It's a reminder of nature's resilience and our dependence on it, urging us to respect and protect this delicate balance for future generations.
D1-362	We consider systems with two competing species whose actions are completely symmetric, with same mobility, reproduction and competition rates. Numerical implementations of the model in two and three-dimensional space show that regions of single species are formed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We propose a theoretical formalism for describing the static profile of the interfaces of empty spaces separating domains with different species. We compute the topological properties of the interfaces and show that these theoretical functions are useful to the understanding of the dynamics of the network. Finally, we compare the theoretical functions with results from the numerical implementation of the mean field equations and verify that our model fits well the properties of interfaces.
D1-363	 In the intricate world of genetics, the allele, a variant form of a gene, plays a pivotal role in determining phenotypic traits. Each gene carries multiple alleles, and these variations are inherited from parents during the process of meiosis. The allele that gets expressed in an individual depends on a combination of factors, including the allele's dominance and the presence of other alleles. Dominant alleles mask the effects of recessive ones, while the expression of codominant alleles results in a blend of traits. Allelic variation, therefore, is the driving force behind phenotypic diversity within species, contributing significantly to evolution and adaptation.

This paper gives a sketch of the fields of applications of proteotronics, by using as significant example the detection of a specific odorant molecule carried out by an olfactory receptor. The experiment is briefly reviewed and its theoretical interpretation given. Further experiments are envisioned and expected results discussed in the perspective of an experimental validation.
D1-365	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds as scientists delve deeper into the intricate world of epigenetics. This field explores how environmental factors and lifestyle choices can influence gene expression, essentially switching genes on and off without altering the DNA sequence itself. A prime example is the impact of nutrition on gene expression, as certain foods can promote either the silencing or activation of specific genes, thereby affecting an organism's health and wellbeing. This fascinating interplay between our diets, genes, and the environment opens up new avenues for personalized medicine, where treatment plans are tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup and lifestyle.

In this work we focus on the estimation and simulation of the bioaccumulation dynamics of persistent pollutants in the marine ecosystem, and we apply the approach for reconstructing a model of PCBs bioaccumulation in the Adriatic sea, estimated after an extensive review of trophic and PCBs concentration data on Adriatic species. Our estimations evidence the occurrence of PCBs biomagnification in the Adriatic food web, together with a strong dependence of bioaccumulation on trophic dynamics and external factors like fishing activity.

D1-368	The eukaryotic flagellum beats with apparently unfailing periodicity, yet responds rapidly to stimuli. Like the human heartbeat, flagellar oscillations are now known to be noisy. Using the alga \textit{C. reinhardtii}, we explore three aspects of nonuniform flagellar beating. We report the existence of rhythmicity, waveform noise peaking at transitions between power and recovery strokes, and fluctuations of interbeat intervals that are correlated and even recurrent, with memory extending to hundreds of beats. These features are altered qualitatively by physiological perturbations. Further, we quantify the recovery of periodic breastroke beating from transient hydrodynamic forcing. These results will help constrain microscopic theories on the origins and regulation of flagellar beating.

The light, a result of a protein called green fluorescent protein (GFP), offers a mesmerizing display when disturbed. This spectacle not only delights observers, but also serves as a survival mechanism, confounding predators with a dazzling dance of light. Beneath the ocean's surface, these luminous jellyfish illuminate the dark, reminding us of the wonders that lurk in the mysteries of our deep-sea world.
D1-370	Two separated levels of functionality are identified in the nanostructure which covers the wings of the grey cicada $\textit{Cicada orni}$ (Hemiptera). The upper level is responsible for superhydrophobic character of the wing while the lower level enhances its anti-reflective behavior. Extensive wetting experiments with various chemical species and optical measurements were performed in order to assess the bi-functionality. Scanning electron microscopy imaging was used to identify the nanostructure morphology. Numerical optical simulations and analytical wetting models were used to prove the roles of both levels of the nanostructure. In addition, the complex refractive index of the chitinous material of the wing was determined from measurements.
D1-371	 In the realm of microbiology, the bacterial species Streptococcus pneumoniae stands out as a significant player. This gram-positive organism is notorious for causing pneumonia, meningitis, and other respiratory tract infections. It thrives in cool, moist environments, making it a common culprit in winter respiratory illnesses. Vaccines are available to combat S. pneumoniae, yet the bacterium demonstrates an uncanny ability to develop resistance, posing an ongoing challenge in global health. Its complex capsule structure, composed of polysaccharides, contributes to its evasiveness, making it a formidable adversary for both the immune system and antibiotics. The battle against S. pneumoniae continues, underscoring the importance of ongoing research and development in vaccine technology.
D1-372	We present a droplet-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) system designed to viably detach biological cells from a surface and sort cell types based on differences in adhesion strength (adhesion contrast), without the need to label cells with molecular markers. The system uses modulated SAW to generate pulsatile flows in the droplets and efficiently detach the cells, thereby minimizing SAW excitation power and exposure time. As a proof-of-principle, the system is shown to efficiently sort HEK 293 from A7r5 cells based on adhesion contrast. Results are obtained in minutes with sorting purity and efficiency reaching 97 % and 95 %, respectively.
D1-373	 In the intricate world of genetics, a gene named SLC6A4 stands out. It's a key player in the serotonin transporter system, regulating the levels of this neurotransmitter in the brain. Imbalances in serotonin can lead to various conditions, including depression and anxiety. Notably, a specific variant of this gene, the 'short' allele, is linked to an increased risk of developing mood disorders. However, it's essential to understand that genes aren't destiny. environmental factors significantly influence the manifestation of these conditions. The study of SLC6A4 offers valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetics, neurotransmitters, and mental health, potentially paving the way for more targeted treatments in the future.
D1-374	Developing robust, quantitative methods to optimize resource allocations in response to epidemics has the potential to save lives and minimize health care costs. In this paper, we develop and apply a computationally efficient algorithm that enables us to calculate the complete probability distribution for the final epidemic size in a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Based on these results, we determine the optimal allocations of a limited quantity of vaccine between two non-interacting populations. We compare the stochastic solution to results obtained for the traditional, deterministic SIR model. For intermediate quantities of vaccine, the deterministic model is a poor estimate of the optimal strategy for the more realistic, stochastic case.
D1-375	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, a branch that studies changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, offers compelling insights into biological phenomena. These modifications, often influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, can be passed on to subsequent generations without any change in DNA sequence. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment offers a unique perspective on heredity, adding a layer of complexity to our understanding of biological systems and potentially paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.
D1-376	Limitation of resources has been recently introduced as a mechanism for the survival and coexistence of cooperators with defectors in well-mixed populations. Here we examine the same model on a scale-free network. A prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network has shown coexistence of cooperators and defectors for the entire range of parameters. Our results show that by introducing the network to the limited resources model, the cooperator-dominated region in the parameter space expands comparing to the results of well-mixed population and the coexistence region becomes narrower. The effect of scale-free network is therefore interpreted as improving the cooperation in the population and reducing the coexistence.
D1-377	 In the fascinating world of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid stands out as a captivating spectacle. Equipped with an intricate system of light-producing organs, these cephalopods emit a dazzling array of flashes and patterns, often used as a defense mechanism or for communication. Their light is generated by a chemical reaction within the cells called photophores, which produce a cold, blue-green glow. A remarkable example is the Dumbo Octopus, a deep-sea dweller that lights up its ears to attract prey in the dark abyss. These luminescent creatures, with their mesmerizing displays, continue to inspire awe and curiosity in the realm of bioluminescence.
D1-378	The radical pair model has been successful in explaining behavioral characteristics of the geomagnetic compass believed to underlie the navigation capability of certain avian species. In this study, the spin dynamics of the radical pair model and decoherence therein are interpreted from a microscopic state transition point of view. This helps to elucidate the interplay between the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions that enables the avian compass, and the distinctive effects of nuclear and environmental decoherence on it. Using a quantum information theoretic quantifier of coherence, we find that nuclear decoherence induces new structure in the spin dynamics without materially affecting the compass action. environmental decoherence, on the other hand, completely disrupts it.
D1-379	 In the realm of microbiology, probiotics emerge as beneficial microorganisms that reside within our gut. These microscopic allies aid in digestion, bolster the immune system, and even impact our mood and cognitive functions. Probiotics are predominantly found in fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi, or can be ingested as supplements. They thrive in our body's alkaline environment, fostering a symbiotic relationship with our human host. Their role in maintaining a balanced gut flora is essential for overall health and wellbeing. However, it's crucial to note that not all probiotics are created equal, and the efficacy of different strains varies. Therefore, understanding the specific benefits of various probiotic strains is key to optimizing one's health.

This review highlights the recent applications of sensitive and selective ratiometric FRET based sensors.
D1-381	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a remarkable process, ensuring the faithful duplication of genetic material during cell division. This process commences at the origin of replication, where a replication fork unravels the double helix. The enzyme helicase unwinds the DNA strands, while single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the exposed single strands. DNA polymerase III, the key player, adds new nucleotides complementary to the template strand, creating new daughter strands. The synthesis proceeds in both directions from the origin, completing the replication of the chromosome. This intricate dance of enzymes and proteins enables the continuity of life, with each new cell carrying the exact same genetic blueprint as the parent cell.
D1-382	The aftermath of influenza infection is determined by a complex set of host-pathogen interactions, where genomic variability on both viral and host sides influences the final outcome. Although there exists large body of literature describing influenza virus variability, only a very small fraction covers the issue of host variance. The goal of this review is to explore the variability of host genes responsible for host-pathogen interactions, paying particular attention to genes responsible for the presence of sialylated glycans in the host endothelial membrane, mucus, genes used by viral immune escape mechanisms, and genes particularly expressed after vaccination, since they are more likely to have a direct influence on the infection outcome.
D1-383	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This biochemical process, primarily carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, is the very foundation of our ecosystem. It not only fuels the growth of these organisms but also provides the oxygen we breathe, making it a vital life support system. Moreover, photosynthesis forms the base of the food chain, as plants serve as a primary food source for numerous organisms, from herbivores to carnivores, thereby maintaining biodiversity. The interconnectedness of photosynthesis and life on Earth underscores its profound importance in preserving and sustaining our planet's health and future.
D1-384	"Establishing a distance between genomes is a significant problem in computational genomics, because its solution can be used to establish evolutionary relationships including phylogeny.   The ""double cut and join"" (DCJ) model of chromosomal rearrangement proposed by Yancopoulos et al. has received attention as it can model inversions, translocations, fusion and fission on a multichromosomal genome that may contain both linear and circular chromosomes. In this paper, we realize the DCJ operator as a group action on the space of multichromosomal genomes. We study this group action, deriving some properties of the group and finding group-theoretic analogues for the key results in the DCJ theory."
D1-385	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed primarily by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. This energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, largely glucose, which are essential for life. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed and water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is vital for respiration in most organisms, making photosynthesis a crucial link in the global carbon and oxygen cycles. It's a testament to nature's ingenious design, a continuous, life-sustaining dance between sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and green plant life.
D1-386	Bismuth Ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles (BFO-NP) display interesting optical (nonlinear response) and magnetic properties which make them amenable for bio-oriented applications as intra- and extra membrane contrast agents. Due to the relatively recent availability of this material in well dispersed nanometric form, its biocompatibility was not known to date. In this study, we present a thorough assessment of the effects of in vitro exposure of human adenocarcinoma (A549), lung squamous carcinoma (NCI-H520), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines to uncoated and poly(ethylene glycol)-coated BFO-NP in the form of cytotoxicity, haemolytic response and biocompatibility. Our results support the attractiveness of the functional-BFO towards biomedical applications focused on advanced diagnostic imaging.
D1-387	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter an organism's genetic makeup. These minute variations, often occurring in non-coding regions, can influence traits, predispose to diseases, or provide evolutionary advantages. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while the G allele of the ACE I/D polymorphism is connected to athletic performance. These genetic markers, when studied extensively, can offer profound insights into human health, disease susceptibility, and even athletic potential, ultimately guiding precision medicine and performance optimization strategies.
D1-388	Chlamydomonas shows both positive and negative phototaxis. It has a single eyespot near its equator and as the cell rotates during forward motion the light signal received by the eyespot varies. We use a simple mechanical model of Chlamydomonas that couples the flagellar beat pattern to the light intensity at the eyespot to demonstrate a mechanism for phototactic steering that is consistent with observations. The direction of phototaxis is controlled by a parameter in our model and the steering mechanism is robust to noise. Our model shows switching between directed phototaxis when the light is on and run-and-tumble behaviour in the dark.
D1-389	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication, a pivotal process, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from parent cells to daughter cells during cell division. This process is initiated at specific sites on the DNA strand known as origins of replication. Two enzymes, helicase and DNA polymerase, work in tandem. Helicase unwinds the double helix, while DNA polymerase synthesizes new strands, using the original strand as a template. Proofreading enzymes correct any errors that may arise during replication, ensuring the integrity of the genetic code. This intricate dance of enzymes and biomolecules ensures the perpetuation of life, underpinning the growth, development, and reproduction of all living organisms.
D1-390	Coordinated motion of cell monolayers during epithelial wound healing and tissue morphogenesis involves mechanical stress generation. Here we propose a model for the dynamics of epithelial expansion that couples mechanical deformations in the tissue to contractile activity and polarization in the cells. A new ingredient of our model is a feedback between local strain, polarization and contractility that naturally yields a mechanism for viscoelasticity and effective inertia in the cell monolayer. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that our model quantitatively reproduces many experimental findings [Nat. Phys. 8, 628 (2012)], including the build-up of intercellular stresses, and the existence of traveling mechanical waves guiding the oscillatory monolayer expansion.
D1-391	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out primarily by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. Chlorophyll, a green pigment, is the key player in this dance. It absorbs light in the blue and red parts of the spectrum, while reflecting green light. Through photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are transformed into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen, thereby maintaining Earth's carbon and oxygen cycles, essential for all life forms. This symbiotic relationship between plants and the environment underscores the vital role of photosynthesis in sustaining life on our planet.
D1-392	When cellular contractile forces are central to pathophysiology, these forces comprise a logical target of therapy. Nevertheless, existing high-throughput screens are limited to upstream signaling intermediates with poorly defined relationship to such a physiological endpoint. Using cellular force as the target, here we screened libraries to identify novel drug candidates in the case of human airway smooth muscle cells in the context of asthma, and also in the case of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells in the context of glaucoma. This approach identified several drug candidates for both asthma and glaucoma. We attained rates of 1000 compounds per screening day, thus establishing a force-based cellular platform for high-throughput drug discovery.
D1-393	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold immense significance. These are minute variations in DNA sequences, often occurring due to random mutations. While most SNPs are harmless, they can influence an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases, respond differently to medications, or even affect physical traits. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, and the CCR5-Δ32 SNP offers partial resistance to HIV. Thus, understanding SNPs and their effects can open new avenues in personalized medicine, offering targeted treatments tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-394	Endocytosis underlies many cellular functions including signaling and nutrient uptake. The endocytosed cargo gets redistributed across a dynamic network of endosomes undergoing fusion and fission. Here, a theoretical approach is reviewed which can explain how the microscopic properties of endosome interactions cause the emergent macroscopic properties of cargo trafficking in the endosomal network. Predictions by the theory have been tested experimentally and include the inference of dependencies and parameter values of the microscopic processes. This theory could also be used to infer mechanisms of signal-trafficking crosstalk. It is applicable to in vivo systems since fixed samples at few time points suffice as input data.
D1-395	 In the realm of evolutionary biology, natural selection, a cornerstone concept, shapes the diversity of life forms. This process favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, gradually molding species over generations. Variation within populations serves as the foundation, with traits arising from genetic mutations or environmental influences. As these variations persist, they can become more prominent or disappear, depending on their impact on fitness. In this intricate dance of genes and environment, species adapt, evolve, and ultimately survive or perish, shaping the rich tapestry of life on Earth.
D1-396	We present a fluorescence-lifetime based method for monitoring cell and tissue activity in situ, during cell culturing and in the presence of a strong autofluorescence background. The miniature fiber-optic probes are easily incorporated in the tight space of a cell culture chamber or in an endoscope. As a first application we monitored the cytosolic calcium levels in porcine tracheal explant cultures using the Calcium Green-5N (CG5N) indicator. Despite the simplicity of the optical setup we are able to detect changes of calcium concentration as small as 2.5 nM, with a monitoring time resolution of less than 1 s.
D1-397	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis emerges as a fundamental process, the respiration of the biosphere. This biochemical miracle, primarily executed by plants and some microorganisms, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process not only sustains the producer organisms but also nourishes the entire ecosystem, providing the primary energy source for all life forms on Earth. Photosynthesis's byproduct, oxygen, is indispensable for aerobic respiration in all creatures, ensuring the continual flow of life in our planet's diverse ecosystems. Thus, photosynthesis, a seemingly simple process, holds a profound importance, underpinning the delicate balance of life on Earth.
D1-398	We analyse a generic motility model, with the motility mechanism arising by contractile stress due to the interaction of myosin and actin. A hydrodynamic active polar gel theory is used to model the cytoplasm of a cell and is combined with a Helfrich-type model to account for membrane properties. The overall model allows to consider motility without the necessity for local adhesion. Besides a detailed numerical approach together with convergence studies for the highly nonlinear free boundary problem, we also compare the induced flow field of the motile cell with that of classical squirmer models and identify the motile cell as a puller or pusher, depending on the strength of the myosin-actin interactions.
D1-399	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton is paramount. These microscopic photosynthetic organisms float in the water column, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into organic matter through photosynthesis. This process provides food for a variety of aquatic life, serving as the foundation of the marine food web. Additionally, phytoplankton play a crucial role in carbon cycling, absorbing vast quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere, thereby helping mitigate climate change. Furthermore, they contribute to ocean productivity, supporting fisheries that sustain millions of people globally. Thus, understanding and preserving phytoplankton populations is vital for maintaining marine biodiversity and ensuring food security.
D1-400	The flavin reductase ActVB is involved in the last step of actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor. Although ActVB can be isolated with some FMN bound, this form was not involved in the flavin reductase activity. By studying the ferric reductase activity of ActVB, we show that its FMN-bound form exhibits a proper enzymatic activity of reduction of iron complexes by NADH. This shows that ActVB active site exhibits a dual property with regard to the FMN. It can use it as a substrate that goes in and off the active site or as a cofactor to provide an electron transferase activity to the polypeptide.
D1-401	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert significant influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found across populations, can subtly alter protein function, contributing to phenotypic diversity. For instance, the APOE4 SNP, prevalent in some populations, is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study of these SNPs offers promising avenues for personalized medicine, as understanding an individual's unique genetic makeup could guide targeted treatments and prevention strategies. Yet, it's crucial to remember that while genetics plays a crucial role in health outcomes, it does not dictate destiny alone. environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and epigenetic modifications also shape our health trajectories.
D1-402	Polymer brushes are increasingly used to tailor surface physicochemistry for various applications such as wetting, adhesion of biological objects, implantable devices, etc. We perform Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations to study the behavior of dense polymer brushes under flow in a slit-pore channel. We discover that the system displays flow inversion at the brush interface for several disconnected ranges of the imposed flow. We associate such phenomenon to collective polymer dynamics: a wave propagating on the brush surface. The relation between the wavelength, the amplitude and the propagation speed of the flow-generated wave is consistent with the solution of the Stokes equations when an imposed traveling wave is assumed as boundary condition (the famous Taylor's swimmer).
D1-403	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing technology. This system, derived from bacteria, utilizes a small RNA molecule to guide a complex of enzymes to a specific DNA sequence, effectively allowing scientists to edit, delete, or correct genetic mutations. The potential applications are vast, from correcting genetic disorders in humans to enhancing crop resistance against diseases. However, the ethical implications are complex and require thorough consideration. As we harness the power of CRISPR, striking a balance between scientific advancement and responsible use will be paramount. The future of genetics promises exciting possibilities, but also demands careful navigation of its moral and societal ramifications.
D1-404	"We present an algorithm to estimate the configurational entropy $S$ of a polymer. The algorithm uses the statistics of coincidences among random samples of configurations and is related to the catch-tag-release method for estimation of population sizes, and to the classic ""birthday paradox"". Bias in the entropy estimation is decreased by grouping configurations in nearly equiprobable partitions based on their energies, and estimating entropies separately within each partition. Whereas most entropy estimation algorithms require $N\sim 2^{S}$ samples to achieve small bias, our approach typically needs only $N\sim \sqrt{2^{S}}$. Thus the algorithm can be applied to estimate protein free energies with increased accuracy and decreased computational cost."
D1-405	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a fundamental process, the very essence of life on Earth. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This conversion takes place in specialized cell organelles called chloroplasts, where pigments like chlorophyll absorb light energy. This energy is then used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, a process crucial for our atmosphere. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide is assimilated, being converted into glucose, the primary energy source for the organism, and other organic compounds. This symphony of biochemical reactions, powered by sunlight, underpins the delicate balance of our ecosystem, making life as we know it possible.
D1-406	In this paper, we study the effects of spike timing-dependent plasticity on synchronisation in a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Neuron plasticity is a flexible property of a neuron and its network to change temporarily or permanently their biochemical, physiological, and morphological characteristics, in order to adapt to the environment. Regarding the plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network architecture, and the external perturbation level.
D1-407	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery is the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool for gene editing. This mechanism, borrowed from bacterial immunity, allows for precise manipulation of DNA sequences. By designing specific guide RNAs, scientists can direct the Cas9 enzyme to a targeted gene, resulting in deletions, insertions, or even modifications of the DNA sequence. This technology holds immense promise for combating genetic diseases, improving crop yield, and furthering our understanding of the intricate dance of genes and proteins that govern life. The ethical and societal implications of such power are vast, necessitating careful consideration as we navigate the uncharted territories of genetic engineering.
D1-408	During cell division, sister chromatids are segregated by the mitotic spindle, a bipolar assembly of interdigitating antiparallel polar filaments called microtubules. Establishing a stable overlap region is essential for maintenance of bipolarity, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a particle-based stochastic model, we find that the interplay of motors and passive cross linkers can robustly generate partial overlaps between antiparallel filaments. Our analysis shows that motors reduce the overlap in a length-dependent manner, whereas passive cross linkers increase it independently of the length. In addition to maintaining structural integrity, passive cross linkers can thus also have a dynamic role for size regulation.
D1-409	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone, the vital process that harnesses sunlight to fuel the Earth's primary producers. Through this miraculous dance, green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, creating a symphony of life. This process not only sustains the lives of organisms at the base of the food chain but also enriches our atmosphere, making it possible for aerobic life to thrive. Photosynthesis, in essence, is a testament to the power of nature, a self-renewing, sustainable system that sustains the delicate balance of our planet. This remarkable process underscores the interconnectedness of life and the intricate web of relationships that govern our world.
D1-410	We present p53-MDM2-Glucose model to study spatio-temporal properties of the system induced by glucose. The variation in glucose concentration level triggers the system at different states, namely, oscillation death (stabilized), sustain and damped oscillations which correspond to various cellular states. The transition of these states induced by glucose is phase transition like behaviour. We also found that the intrinsic noise in stochastic system helps the system to stabilize more effectively. Further, the amplitude of $p53$ dynamics with the variation of glucose concentration level follows power law behaviour, $A_s(k)\sim k^\gamma$, where, $\gamma$ is a constant.
D1-411	 Exploring the intricate world of genetics, we delve into DNA's double helix structure, a genetic blueprint that encodes the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each strand of this helix is composed of nucleotides, with four distinct bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The sequence of these bases forms the genetic code, a complex language that dictates the synthesis of proteins essential for life. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, while evolution is driven by the gradual accumulation of such mutations over generations. This understanding of genetics, coupled with ongoing research, continues to revolutionize our comprehension of life and its intricate, interwoven tapestry.
D1-412	The course of a peritrichous bacterium such as E. coli crucially depends on the level of synchronization and self-organization of several rotating flagella. However, the rotation of each flagellum generates counter body movements which in turn affect the flagellar dynamics. Using a detailed numerical model of an E. coli, we demonstrate that flagellar entanglement, besides fluid flow relative to the moving body, dramatically changes the dynamics of flagella from that compared to anchored flagella. In particular, bundle formation occurs through a zipping motion in a remarkably rapid time, affected little by initial flagellar orientation. A simplified analytical model supports our observations. Finally, we illustrate how entanglement, hydrodynamic interactions, and body movement contribute to zipping and bundling.
D1-413	 In marine ecosystems, the barnacle, a sessile crustacean, plays a significant role. Attached firmly to rocky shores and submerged surfaces, barnacles filter-feed, consuming plankton and detritus suspended in the water. They contribute to nutrient cycling, enhancing marine productivity. Barnacles' hard, calcium carbonate shells provide habitat for numerous organisms, fostering biodiversity. Additionally, their burrow-like structures help reduce wave energy, aiding in coastal erosion prevention. As climate change alters ocean temperatures and acidity levels, the future of these vital inhabitants remains uncertain, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.
D1-414	To adapt their behaviour in changing environments, cells sense concentrations by binding external ligands to their receptors. However, incorrect ligands may bind nonspecifically to receptors, and when their concentration is large, this binding activity may interfere with the sensing of the ligand of interest. Here, I derive analytically the physical limit to the accuracy of concentration sensing amid a large number of interfering ligands. A scaling transition is found when the mean bound time of correct ligands is twice that of incorrect ligands. I discuss how the physical bound can be approached by a cascade of receptor states generalizing kinetic proof-reading schemes.
D1-415	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between nature and nurture. Epigenetics, essentially, involves changes in gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. These changes are primarily driven by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and behavior, creating a dynamic interplay between our genetic makeup and life experiences. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification, act as switches controlling when genes are turned on or off, shaping our physiology, behavior, and susceptibility to diseases across generations. This field underscores the profound influence of our environment on our genetic expression, redefining our understanding of heredity and offering promising avenues for disease prevention and treatment.
D1-416	Cells modify their volume in response to changes in osmotic pressure but it is usually assumed that other active shape variations do not involve significant volume fluctuations. Here we report experiments demonstrating that water transport in and out of the cell is needed for the formation of blebs, commonly observed protrusions in the plasma membrane driven by cortex contraction. We develop and simulate a model of fluid mediated membrane-cortex deformations and show that a permeable membrane is necessary for bleb formation which is otherwise impaired. Taken together our experimental and theoretical results emphasize the subtle balance between hydrodynamics and elasticity in actively driven cell morphological changes.
D1-417	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery lies in the study of epigenetics. This field uncovers modifications in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, such as age, environment, and lifestyle, which can switch genes on or off. These epigenetic changes are crucial in development, cellular functions, and even in response to disease. For instance, in cancer, abnormal epigenetic changes often lead to uncontrolled cell growth, underscoring the potential of epigenetic therapies to combat this deadly disease. This dynamic dance of genes and their regulators offers a captivating glimpse into the intricacies of biological systems and their susceptibility to both nature and nurture.
D1-418	A simple nonlinear transmission-line model of the cochlea with longitudinal coupling is introduced that can reproduce Basilar membrane response and neural tuning in the chinchilla. It is found that the middle ear has little effect on cochlear resonances, and hence conclude that the theory of coherent reflections is not applicable to the model. The model also provides an explanation of the emergence of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs). It is argued that SOAEs arise from Hopf bifurcations of the transmission-line model and not from localized instabilities. The paper shows that emissions can become chaotic, intermittent and fragile to perturbations.
D1-419	 In the realm of genetics, gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized our ability to manipulate DNA sequences. This technique, derived from bacteria's adaptive immune system, precisely targets and edits specific genes, offering a promising avenue for treating genetic diseases. Beyond medicine, gene editing could potentially eradicate harmful pests in agriculture, conserve endangered species, or even enhance crop resilience. However, ethical concerns loom large, such as the potential for designing 'designer babies' or unintended consequences in altered gene pools. Navigating this complex landscape requires prudent policy-making, informed public discourse, and a deep understanding of the biological and societal implications of gene editing.
D1-420	The effect of fat content in cheese curds on their rheological properties was examined using dynamic shear measurements. Surplus fat addition to milk samples caused two distinct types of changes in the temperature dependence of the viscoelastic moduli of resultant curds. The first was a significant reduction in the moduli over a wide temperature range, which is attributed to the presence of liquefied fat globules within the milk protein network. The second was the excess contribution to the low-temperature moduli owing to the reinforcing effect of solidified fat globules. An upward shift in the sol-gel phase transition temperature driven by an increased fat content was also observed.
D1-421	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis, the life-giving process, unfolds in various organisms. This marvelous event occurs when green plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb carbon dioxide and water, harnessing sunlight's energy through chlorophyll. This energy is then used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen - a vital component for respiration in most life forms. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide is converted into glucose, a primary energy source. This symphony of chemistry, driven by sunlight, ensures the survival and productivity of our planet's ecosystems, making photosynthesis integral to life as we know it.
D1-422	Cells use surface receptors to estimate the concentration of external ligands. Limits on the accuracy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species. However, the environment typically contains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different affinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such cross-talk prevents accurate inference of individual ligand concentrations. In contrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy. We argue that such high-accuracy estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized by the familiar kinetic proofreading mechanism.
D1-423	 In the intricate world of genetics, the mysterious X and Y chromosomes play pivotal roles in determining sex. During meiosis, the sex cells (gametes) divide, shuffling genetic material from each parent. In humans, females have two X chromosomes, while males inherit one X and one Y. The Y chromosome carries a small cluster of genes, notably the SRY gene, which triggers male development during embryonic stages. This binary genetic system, though seemingly simple, underpins the complexities of gender and sexual reproduction in our species.
D1-424	We study the mechanical unfolding of a simple model protein. The Langevin dynamics results are analyzed using Markov-model methods which allow to describe completely the configurational space of the system. Using transition path theory we also provide a quantitative description of the unfolding pathways followed by the system. Our study shows a complex dynamical scenario. In particular, we see that the usual one-dimensional picture: free-energy vs end-to-end distance representation, gives a misleading description of the process. Unfolding can occur following different pathways and configurations which seem to play a central role in one-dimensional pictures are not the intermediate states of the unfolding dynamics.
D1-425	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the 'powerhouses' of cells, play a crucial role in energy production. They are double-membraned organelles that generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This process harnesses the energy stored in nutrients, primarily glucose and fatty acids, converting it into ATP, the primary energy currency for cells. Mitochondria's essential role in cellular energy metabolism is underscored by their presence in nearly every cell type and their involvement in various cellular functions, including apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Despite their ancient origins, traced back to free-living bacteria that were engulfed by primitive eukaryotic cells, mitochondria continue to fascinate scientists due to their complex structure and vital functions.
D1-426	We demonstrate that characteristic nodules emerge in cultures of several malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines. Instead of excessive local cell proliferation, the nodules arise by Myosin II-driven cell contractility. The aggregation process can be prevented or reversed by suitable pharmacological inhibitors of acto-myosin contractility. A cell-resolved elasto-plastic model of the multicellular patterning process indicates that the morphology and size of the nodules as well as the speed of their formation is determined by the mechanical tension cells exert on their neighbors, and the stability of cell-substrate adhesion complexes. A linear stability analysis of a homogenous, self-tensioned Maxwell fluid indicates the unconditional presence of a patterning instability.
D1-427	 In the intricate world of molecular biology, the role of DNA polymerase cannot be overstated. This enzyme is indispensable in DNA replication, a process essential for cell division and growth. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the growing strand of DNA, ensuring the fidelity of the replication process by adding the correct nucleotide base pairs (A-T and C-G). It's a meticulous task, carried out with enzymatic precision, that underpins the continuity of life. The synthesis of RNA, another crucial biomolecule, is also facilitated by similar enzymes, RNA polymerases, highlighting the centrality of polymerases in genetic material synthesis.
D1-428	We study the effect of intrinsic noise on the thermodynamic balance of complex chemical networks subtending cellular metabolism and gene regulation. A topological network property called deficiency, known to determine the possibility of complex behavior such as multistability and oscillations, is shown to also characterize the entropic balance. In particular, only when deficiency is zero does the average stochastic dissipation rate equal that of the corresponding deterministic model, where correlations are disregarded. In fact, dissipation can be reduced by the effect of noise, as occurs in a toy model of metabolism that we employ to illustrate our findings. This phenomenon highlights that there is a close interplay between deficiency and the activation of new dissipative pathways at low molecule numbers.
D1-429	 In the vast and intricate world of molecular biology, the study of DNA replication stands as a fundamental process. This process, occurring within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, duplicates the genetic material before cell division. It involves several key proteins, such as helicases, primases, and polymerases, each responsible for unwinding the double helix, synthesizing RNA primers, and extending these primers into new DNA strands, respectively. The precision of DNA replication ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation of cells to the next, underpinning the continuity of life.
D1-430	We propose a stochastic individual-based model of the progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). The model operates at patient level over a lifetime and is based on elements of the physiology and biophysics of AF, making contact with existing mechanistic models. The outputs of the model are times when the patient is in normal rhythm and AF, and we carry out a population-level analysis of the statistics of disease progression. While the model is stylised at present and not directly predictive, future improvements are proposed to tighten the gap between existing mechanistic models of AF, and epidemiological data, with a view towards model-based personalised medicine.
D1-431	 In botany, the process of photosynthesis is a fascinating spectacle of life's resilience. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, a process mediated by chlorophyll in their leaves. This biological marvel is crucial for maintaining Earth's oxygen levels, supporting aerobic life forms, and providing food for countless species. Photosynthesis also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, helping regulate the Earth's climate by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The intricate dance between light, water, and carbon dioxide not only nourishes the plant but also sustains the planet's ecosystems, underscoring the indispensable role of photosynthesis in life on Earth.
D1-432	A small portion of a tissue defines a microstate in gene expression space. Mutations, epigenetic events or external factors cause microstate displacements which are modeled by combining small independent gene expression variations and large Levy jumps, resulting from the collective variations of a set of genes. The risk of cancer in a tissue is estimated as the microstate probability to transit from the normal to the tumor region in gene expression space. The formula coming from the contribution of large Levy jumps seems to provide a qualitatively correct description of the lifetime risk of cancer, and reveals an interesting connection between the risk and the way the tissue is protected against infections.
D1-433	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has gained significant attention. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes occur through modifications to the proteins that wrap around DNA, known as histones, or chemical tags added to DNA itself. These alterations can influence how genes are read and interpreted by the cell, thus impacting the development, function, and behavior of an organism. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by various factors, such as diet, stress, age, and environmental exposures, providing a fascinating link between our lifestyle choices and genetic predispositions. This field continues to evolve, offering promising avenues for understanding complex traits, diseases, and potential interventions.
D1-434	Enzymes have been recently found to exhibit enhanced diffusion due to their catalytic activities. A recent experiment [C. Riedel et al., Nature 517, 227 (2015)] has found evidence that suggests this phenomenon might be controlled by the degree of exothermicity of the catalytic reaction involved. Four mechanisms that can lead to this effect, namely, self-thermophoresis, boost in kinetic energy, stochastic swimming, and collective heating, are critically discussed, and it is shown that only the last two could be strong enough to account for the observations. The resulting quantitative description is used to examine the biological significance of the effect.
D1-435	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the human genome project stands as a groundbreaking achievement. This endeavor, completed in 2003, mapped the entirety of human DNA, providing a comprehensive blueprint of the building blocks of life. This knowledge has revolutionized numerous fields, from personalized medicine to forensic science, by offering a deeper understanding of our genetic makeup and its role in health and disease. As we delve deeper into this genetic code, the potential for medical advancements and improved quality of life becomes increasingly evident. The human genome project serves as a testament to human curiosity and our relentless pursuit of knowledge, offering a glimpse into the future of medicine and our ongoing efforts to conquer the mysteries of life itself.
D1-436	Gene regulatory circuits must contend with intrinsic noise that arises due to finite numbers of proteins. While some circuits act to reduce this noise, others appear to exploit it. A striking example is the competence circuit in Bacillus subtilis, which exhibits much larger noise in the duration of its competence events than a synthetically constructed analog that performs the same function. Here, using stochastic modeling and fluorescence microscopy, we show that this larger noise allows cells to exit terminal phenotypic states, which expands the range of stress levels to which cells are responsive and leads to phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. This is an important example of how noise confers a functional benefit in a genetic decision-making circuit.
D1-437	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a vital thread. This biochemical process, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, is the cornerstone of life on Earth. Harnessing sunlight's energy, these organisms convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through a series of chemical reactions within their chloroplasts. This symphony of reactions not only fuels the organisms themselves but also oxygenates our atmosphere, supporting the survival of aerobic life forms. Moreover, photosynthesis acts as a primary carbon sink, sequestering carbon dioxide, thus mitigating the impacts of climate change. The delicate balance of photosynthesis, essential for life's persistence, is a testament to nature's ingenuity and resilience.
D1-438	A biological system consists of a variety of polymers that are synthesized from monomers, by catalysis that exists only for some long polymers. It is important to elucidate the emergence and sustenance of such autocatalytic polymerization. We analyze here the stochastic polymerization reaction dynamics, to investigate the transition time from a state with almost no catalysts to a state with sufficient catalysts. We found an optimal volume that minimizes this transition time, which agrees with the inverse of the catalyst concentration at the unstable fixed point that separates the two states, as is theoretically explained. Relevance to the origin of life is also discussed.
D1-439	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, occurring in green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Through a series of complex reactions, the light energy captured by chlorophyll triggers the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen, essential for respiration in most organisms, including humans, underscores photosynthesis's significance in maintaining global oxygen levels and supporting life on Earth.
D1-440	Recent years have witnessed a surge of biological interest in the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem for its relevance to automatic model construction using the distances between data points. Despite the increasing use of MST algorithms for this purpose, the goodness-of-fit of an MST to the data is often elusive because no quantitative criteria have been developed to measure it. Motivated by this, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that a metric space on n points can be represented by a fully labeled tree on n vertices, and thereby determine when an MST preserves all pairwise distances between points in a finite metric space.
D1-441	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the firefly squid, captivates researchers with its radiant display. This deep-sea dweller emits light from specialized organs called photophores, creating intricate patterns that serve multiple functions. These patterns can distract predators, confuse prey, or aid in communication among individuals. The firefly squid produces light through a chemical reaction within its light-producing cells, a phenomenon known as chemiluminescence. This fascinating cephalopod continues to inspire scientific curiosity, as researchers aim to unravel the mysteries hidden within its mesmerizing underwater dance.
D1-442	Many membrane-bound molecules in cells form small clusters. It has been hypothesized that these clusters convert an analog extracellular signal into a digital intracellular signal and that this conversion increases signaling fidelity. However, the mechanism by which clusters digitize a signal and the subsequent effects on fidelity remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate using a stochastic model of cooperative cluster formation that sufficient cooperation leads to digital signaling. We show that despite reducing the number of output states, which decreases fidelity, digitization also reduces noise in the system, which increases fidelity. The tradeoff between these effects leads to an optimal cluster size that agrees with experimental measurements.
D1-443	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics unveils a fascinating layer of biological complexity. Epigenetics, a term coined in 1942, refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, primarily through methylation and acetylation of histones and other chromatin-associated molecules, influence the accessibility of genes, thereby regulating when and to what extent they are expressed. Epigenetic modifications are dynamic and can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle choices, underscoring their significant role in health and disease. The study of epigenetics offers profound insights into heredity, development, and the potential for preventing or treating diseases by modifying these reversible changes.
D1-444	The three dimensional structure of DNA in the nucleus (chromatin) plays an important role in many cellular processes. Recent experimental advances have led to high-throughput methods of capturing information about chromatin conformation on genome-wide scales. New models are needed to quantitatively interpret this data at a global scale. Here we introduce the use of tools from topological data analysis to study chromatin conformation. We use persistent homology to identify and characterize conserved loops and voids in contact map data and identify scales of interaction. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on simulated data and then look data from both a bacterial genome and a human cell line. We identify substantial multiscale topology in these datasets.
D1-445	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a striking example of biological harmony. This mutualistic relationship, where two different species live in close proximity, benefits each partner. For instance, consider the relationship between clownfish and sea anemones. Clownfish, with their vibrant colors, find protection among the anemone's stinging tentacles, while the anemone gains a constant food source in the form of the fish's leftovers and parasites. This symbiotic partnership is a testament to the adaptability and interdependence that characterize the diverse world of biology.
D1-446	We perform a statistical study of the distances between successive occurrencies of a given dinucleotide in the DNA sequence for a number of organisms of different complexity. Our analysis highlights peculiar features of the dinucleotide CG distribution in mammalian DNA, pointing towards a connection with the role of such dinucleotide in DNA methylation. While the CG distributions of mammals exhibit exponential tails with comparable parameters, the picture for the other organisms studied (e.g., fish, insects, bacteria and viruses) is more heterogeneous, possibly because in these organisms DNA methylation has different functional roles. Our analysis suggests that the distribution of the distances between dinucleotides CG provides useful insights in characterizing and classifying organisms in terms of methylation functionalities.
D1-447	 In marine biology, the giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is an elusive and enigmatic deep-sea dweller. This colossal cephalopod, reaching up to 43 feet in length, possesses the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, each measuring approximately 10 inches in diameter. Their enormous eyes, equipped with a unique multi-layered cornea, allow them to capture even the faintest of light in the ocean's abyss. Despite their intimidating size, their diet primarily consists of fish and other squid species. Their lives remain shrouded in mystery, as their behavior and reproduction are scarcely understood, making them one of the last great ocean mysteries to be explored.
D1-448	We model and simulate the performance of charge-transfer in nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the CP29 light-harvesting antenna-complex associated with photosystem II (PSII). The model consists of five discrete excitonic energy states and two sinks, responsible for the potentially damaging processes and charge-transfer channels, respectively. We demonstrate that by varying (i) the parameters of the chlorophyll-based dimer, (ii) the resonant properties of the protein-solvent environment interaction, and (iii) the energy transfer rates to the sinks, one can significantly improve the performance of the NPQ. Our analysis suggests strategies for improving the performance of the NPQ in response to environmental changes, and may stimulate experimental verification.
D1-449	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid plays a captivating role. Using a specialized light-producing organ, these cephalopods generate fleeting, radiant flashes. This luminous display serves various purposes, including attracting prey, deterring predators, and communicating with peers in the dark abyss. The light, created by a chemical reaction, is a testament to the intricate biochemistry within these creatures. The squid's dance of light adds a mesmerizing layer to the mystery and complexity of life beneath the ocean waves.
D1-450	Limited-view artefacts are commonly present in optoacoustic tomography images, mainly due to practical geometrical and physical constraints imposed by the imaging systems as well as limited light penetration into large optically opaque samples. Herein, a new approach termed dynamic particle-enhanced optoacoustic tomography (DPOT) is proposed for improving image contrast and visibility of optoacoustic images under limited-view scenarios. The method is based on the non- linear combination of a temporal sequence of tomographic reconstructions representing sparsely distributed moving particles. We demonstrate experimental performance by dynamically imaging the flow of suspended microspheres in three dimensions, which shows promise for DPOT applicability in angiographic imaging in living organisms.
D1-451	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a captivating sub-discipline. While DNA serves as the blueprint of life, epigenetics reveals how environmental factors and lifestyle choices can influence gene expression, essentially switching genes 'on' or 'off', without altering the DNA sequence itself. This phenomenon, manifested through mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modification, sheds light on the impact of diet, stress, and behavior on disease susceptibility and aging processes. Epigenetics, in essence, underscores the profound interplay between our genes and the world around us, redefining our understanding of heredity and health.
D1-452	We study mathematical models describing the evolution of stochastic age-structured populations. After reviewing existing approaches, we present a full kinetic framework for age-structured interacting populations undergoing birth, death and fission processes, in spatially dependent environments. We define the complete probability density for the population-size-age-chart and find results under specific conditions. Connections with more classical models are also explicitly derived. In particular, we show that factorial moments for non-interacting processes are described by a natural generalization of the McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which describes mean-field deterministic behaviour. Our approach utilizes mixed type, multi-dimensional probability distributions similar to those employed in the study of gas kinetics, with terms that satisfy BBGKY-like equation hierarchies.
D1-453	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can significantly influence phenotypic traits. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often found in non-coding regions, can subtly alter gene expression, contributing to genetic diversity among individuals. SNPs, though seemingly insignificant, play a pivotal role in determining susceptibility to various diseases, drug responses, and even physical attributes. For instance, a particular SNP could influence the efficiency of glucose metabolism, thus increasing an individual's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This underscores the profound impact of genetics on human health, encouraging further research to unlock the vast potential of these genetic markers for personalized medicine and disease prevention strategies.
D1-454	We present a theoretical analysis of exciton transfer and decoherence effects in a photosynthetic dimer interacting with collective (correlated) and local (uncorrelated) protein-solvent environments. Our approach is based on the framework of the spin-boson model. We derive explicitly the thermal relaxation and decoherence rates of the exciton transfer process, valid for arbitrary temperatures and for arbitrary (in particular, large) interaction constants between the dimer and the environments. We establish a generalization of the Marcus formula, giving reaction rates for dimer levels possibly individually and asymmetrically coupled to environments. We identify rigorously parameter regimes for the validity of the generalized Marcus formula.   The existence of long living quantum coherences at ambient temperatures emerges naturally from our approach.
D1-455	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, a symphony of chemical reactions that sustain our planet. This biological phenomenon, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose. This process occurs within chloroplasts, where pigments such as chlorophyll absorb light. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, while oxygen is a byproduct, making photosynthesis indispensable in maintaining Earth's atmospheric balance. Photosynthesis underpins the food chain, serving as the primary source of energy for virtually all life on Earth. It's a testament to nature's efficiency and resilience, a continuous cycle that breathes life into our world.
D1-456	"We explore the range of probabilistic behaviours that can be engineered with Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). We show that at steady state CRNs are able to ""program"" any distribution with finite support in $\mathbb{N}^m$, with $m \geq 1$. Moreover, any distribution with countable infinite support can be approximated with arbitrarily small error under the $L^1$ norm. We also give optimized schemes for special distributions, including the uniform distribution. Finally, we formulate a calculus to compute on distributions that is complete for finite support distributions, and can be compiled to a restricted class of CRNs that at steady state realize those distributions."
D1-457	 In marine ecosystems, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) plays a crucial role. This colossal brown alga, reaching up to 200 feet, thrives in cold, nutrient-rich waters. It not only provides food for various marine species, but also offers shelter and breeding grounds. The kelp forest, its underwater habitat, enhances biodiversity, serving as a sanctuary for seals, otters, and numerous fish species. The kelp also aids in carbon sequestration, helping mitigate climate change. However, this magnificent species faces threats such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change itself. Conservation efforts are critical to preserve these underwater forests and the myriad of life they sustain.
D1-458	Understanding protein self-assembly is important for many biological and industrial processes. Proteins can self-assemble into crystals, filaments, gels, and other amorphous aggregates. The final forms include virus capsids and condensed phases associated with diseases, such as amyloid fibrils. Although seemingly different, these assemblies all originate from fundamental protein interactions and are driven by similar thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Here we review recent advances in understanding protein self-assembly through a soft condensed matter perspective with an emphasis on three specific systems: globular proteins, viruses and amyloid fibers. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions in the field.
D1-459	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton is paramount. Tiny but mighty, these microscopic organisms form the base of the food chain. Through photosynthesis, they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into organic matter, providing energy for various marine life forms. Their productivity significantly impacts oceanic carbon cycling, helping to mitigate climate change by absorbing CO2. However, human activities such as overfishing and pollution threaten phytoplankton populations, potentially disrupting delicate marine food webs and exacerbating global warming. Encouraging sustainable practices and preserving marine habitats becomes crucial to ensure the health and resilience of these vital organisms and the ecosystems they support.
D1-460	Aim: Molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis are well-established approaches to generate receptor conformational ensembles (RCEs) for ligand docking and virtual screening. Here, we report new fast molecular dynamics-based and normal mode analysis-based protocols combined with conformational pocket classifications to efficiently generate RCEs. Materials \& methods: We assessed our protocols on two well-characterized protein targets showing local active site flexibility, dihydrofolate reductase and large collective movements, CDK2. The performance of the RCEs was validated by distinguishing known ligands of dihydrofolate reductase and CDK2 among a dataset of diverse chemical decoys. Results \& discussion: Our results show that different simulation protocols can be efficient for generation of RCEs depending on different kind of protein flexibility.
D1-461	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found in non-coding regions, can subtly alter gene expression or protein function. While most SNPs have negligible effects, some can lead to hereditary diseases or predispose individuals to certain conditions. For instance, the APOE4 SNP increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the profound influence of genetics on our health and wellbeing. Simultaneously, understanding these SNPs offers potential avenues for cutting-edge treatments and personalized medicine. The interplay between genes and environment in shaping an organism's phenotype remains a captivating and ever-evolving area of biological inquiry.
D1-462	Living systems, particularly multicellular systems, often seem hopelessly complex. But recent studies have suggested that beneath this complexity, there may be unifying quantitative principles that we are only now starting to unravel. All cells interact with their environments and with other cells. Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each other. The complexity of these multicellular systems, due to the large numbers of cells and the diversity of intracellular and intercellular interactions, makes understanding multicellular systems a daunting task. To overcome this challenge, we will likely need judicious simplifications and conceptual frameworks that can reveal design principles that are shared among diverse multicellular systems. Here we review some recent progress towards developing such frameworks.
D1-463	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds the power of epigenetics. This science, not altering DNA sequence, instead, modifies how genes are read, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle. For instance, a person's diet can impact gene expression, leading to potential health benefits or risks. This concept challenges the traditional understanding of genetics, emphasizing that our genes are not our destiny, but rather a dynamic blueprint that can be influenced and shaped by our choices and experiences. Epigenetics, thus, opens a door to a more nuanced understanding of heredity, promising possibilities for preventive and personalized medicine.
D1-464	The precision of concentration sensing is improved when cells communicate. Here we derive the physical limits to concentration sensing for cells that communicate over short distances by directly exchanging small molecules (juxtacrine signaling), or over longer distances by secreting and sensing a diffusive messenger molecule (autocrine signaling). In the latter case, we find that the optimal cell spacing can be large, due to a tradeoff between maintaining communication strength and reducing signal cross-correlations. This leads to the surprising result that autocrine signaling allows more precise sensing than juxtacrine signaling for sufficiently large populations. We compare our results to data from a wide variety of communicating cell types.
D1-465	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, a vital process, serves as the heartbeat of our planet. This biochemical reaction, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only sustains the life of these organisms but also nourishes the entire ecosystem, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food chain's foundation. Photosynthesis' efficiency, however, is influenced by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, making it a critical area of study for scientists seeking to combat climate change and promote sustainable agriculture.
D1-466	Recently, we have proposed a new illness-death model that comprises a state of undiagnosed chronic disease preceding the diagnosed disease. Based on this model, the question arises how case-finding can be assessed in the presence of mortality from all these states. We simulate two scenarios of different performance of case-finding and apply several indices to assess case-finding in both scenarios. One of the prevalence based indices leads to wrong conclusions. Some indices are partly insensitive to distinguish the quality of case-finding. The incidence based indices perform well. If possible, incidence based indices should be preferred.
D1-467	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process, occurring primarily in green plant leaves, is a testament to nature's intricate balance. Chlorophyll, a key pigment found in chloroplasts, captures sunlight, enabling the transformation of light energy into chemical energy. This energy drives the separation of water molecules, resulting in oxygen being released into the atmosphere, a vital component for most life forms. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose, a fundamental sugar that plants use for growth and reproduction. Photosynthesis, thus, is not merely a plant's means of survival, but a fundamental life-support system for our planet.
D1-468	Integrating population genetics into community ecology theory is a major goal in ecology and evolution, but analyzing the resulting models is computationally daunting. Here we describe sPEGG ($\underline{\textrm{s}}\textrm{imulating}$ $\underline{\textrm{P}}\textrm{henotypic}$ $\underline{\textrm{E}}\textrm{volution}$ on $\underline{\textrm{G}}\textrm{eneral Purpose}$ $\underline{\textrm{G}}\textrm{raphics Processing Units}$ (GPGPUs)), an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator. Using a single commodity GPGPU instead of a single central processor, we find sPEGG can accelerate eco-evolutionary simulations by a factor of over 200, comparable to performance on a small-to-medium sized computer cluster.
D1-469	 In the realm of molecular biology, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, essential for cell division and growth, involves multiple proteins working in tandem. The double helix structure of DNA splits, allowing each strand to serve as a template for a new, complementary strand. This synthesis happens in the 5' to 3' direction, akin to the unwinding of a zipper, ensuring the accuracy of DNA copies. The replication fork, a structure formed by the enzymes and proteins involved, moves along the DNA, copying and recopying the genetic information, thus maintaining life's blueprint for future generations.
D1-470	Traditional approaches to understanding the brain's resilience to neuropathology have identified neurophysiological variables, often described as brain or cognitive 'reserve,' associated with better outcomes. However, mechanisms of function and resilience in large-scale brain networks remain poorly understood. Dynamic network theory may provide a basis for substantive advances in understanding functional resilience in the human brain. In this perspective, we describe recent theoretical approaches from network control theory as a framework for investigating network level mechanisms underlying cognitive function and the dynamics of neuroplasticity in the human brain. We describe the theoretical opportunities offered by the application of network control theory at the level of the human connectome to understand cognitive resilience and inform translational intervention.
D1-471	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, a significant focus lies on DNA replication - the process that ensures genetic information is faithfully copied during cell division. This process, initiated at the origin of replication, unfolds as a complex dance of enzymes. Helicases unwind the double helix, while primases synthesize short RNA primers. Polymerases then extend these primers, synthesizing new DNA strands. Okazaki fragments, the pieces created, are later joined together by DNA ligase, completing the replicated DNA molecule. This intricate choreography is crucial for maintaining life's continuity across generations.
D1-472	Lipid bilayers forming biological membranes are known to behave as viscous 2D fluids on submicrometer scales. usually they contain a large number of active protein inclusions. Recently, it has been shown [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 112, E3639 (2015)] that such active proteins should in- duce non-thermal fluctuating lipid flows leading to diffusion enhancement and chemotaxis-like drift for passive inclusions in biomembranes. Here, a detailed analytical and numerical investigation of such effects is performed. The attention is focused on the situations when proteins are concentrated within lipid rafts. We demonstrate that passive particles tend to become attracted by active rafts and are accumulated inside them.
D1-473	 In the vast realm of biology, the humble microbe continues to astonish scientists. These minuscule organisms, unseen by the naked eye, play pivotal roles in our world. They decompose waste, enrich soil, and are instrumental in the nitrogen cycle, ensuring plant growth. Some microbes, like probiotics, enhance human health by maintaining our gut's delicate balance. Others, like the bacteria in our mouth, help break down food and prevent harmful pathogens from causing diseases. Yet, despite their importance, microbes remain vastly understudied, with an estimated 99% of species yet to be discovered. Their untapped potential offers a treasure trove of opportunities for medical, agricultural, and environmental advancements.
D1-474	By employing a series of massively parallel ab-initio simulations, we study how optical forces act on biological matter subject to morphological disease. As a representative case study, we here consider the case of Plasmodium Falciparum on red blood cells (RBC) illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave. Realistic parameters for the geometry and the refractive index are then taken from published experiments. In our theoretical campaign, we study the dependence of the optical force on the disease stage for different incident wavelengths. We show that optical forces change significantly with the disease, with amplitude variation in the hundreds of pN range. Our results open up new avenues for the design of new optical systems for the treatment of human disease.
D1-475	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis stands out as a critical process, the lifeblood of our planet. This phenomenal biochemical reaction, executed by green plants and some microorganisms, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is a continuous cycle of life, sustaining all organisms on Earth by providing the essential energy and oxygen we need. Furthermore, photosynthesis serves as a vital carbon sink, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby mitigating climate change. It's a testament to nature's ingenious design, a symphony of chemistry and physics that keeps our planet alive.
D1-476	A genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon 2, is available but no interface exists to interactively visualise its content integrated with omics data and simulation results. We manually drew a comprehensive map, ReconMap 2.0, that is consistent with the content of Recon 2. We present it within a web interface that allows content query, visualization of custom datasets and submission of feedback to manual curators. ReconMap can be accessed via http://vmh.uni.lu, with network export in a Systems Biology Graphical Notation compliant format. A Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) Toolbox extension to interact with ReconMap is available via https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox.
D1-477	 In the realm of microbiology, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes, distinct domains of life, coexist harmoniously. Prokaryotes, single-celled organisms without a nucleus, are the most abundant and diverse, inhabiting virtually every environment. Eukaryotes, characterized by a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, form the domains Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista. These complex cells host intricate systems, enabling multicellular organisms to thrive, carrying out diverse roles from photosynthesis to hunting. Despite their differences, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes play crucial roles in maintaining Earth's ecological balance, contributing to nutrient cycling, food chains, and biodegradation processes. Their symbiotic relationships further enrich the biodiversity on our planet, fostering a delicate yet resilient web of life.
D1-478	Escherichia coli swims using flagella activated by rotary motors. The direction of rotation of the motors is indirectly regulated by the binding of a single messenger protein. The conformational spread model has been shown to accurately describe the equilibrium properties as well as the dynamics of the flagellar motor. In this paper we study this model from an analytic point of view. By exploiting the separation of timescales observed in experiments, we show how to reduce the conformational spread model to a coarse-grained, cooperative binding model. We show that this simplified model reproduces very well the dynamics of the motor switch.
D1-479	 In marine ecosystems, the ocean sunfish, or Mola mola, stands out as an intriguing biology marvel. Reaching weights up to 2,300 pounds and lengths of 10 feet, it is the heaviest bony fish in the world. Uniquely shaped, its flattened body and dorsal fins resemble a flying saucer. Unlike other fish, the sunfish is primarily pelagic, dwelling in open waters rather than near the seabed. Its diet consists mainly of jellyfish, which it crushes with specialized bones in its head. Intriguingly, sunfish are frequently found floating upside down, a behavior thought to aid in jellyfish capture and thermoregulation. This enigmatic creature continues to captivate scientists and marine enthusiasts alike.
D1-480	Dense active matter, from bacterial suspensions and microtubule bundles driven by motor proteins to cellular monolayers and synthetic Janus particles, is characterised by mesoscale turbulence, the emergence of chaotic flow structures. By immersing an ordered array of symmetric rotors in an active fluid, we introduce a microfluidic system that exploits spontaneous symmetry breaking in mesoscale turbulence to generate work. The lattice of rotors self-organises into a spin-state where neighbouring discs continuously rotate in permanent alternating directions due to combined hydrodynamic and elastic effects. Our virtual prototype demonstrates a new research direction for the design of micromachines powered by the nematohydrodynamic properties of active turbulence.
D1-481	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a groundbreaking discovery. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes are a result of chemical modifications to DNA and its associated proteins, known as histones. These modifications, influenced by factors such as age, environment, and behavior, can switch genes on or off, ultimately shaping the organism's traits and health. This field has profound implications for our understanding of heredity, disease, and even the effects of certain lifestyle choices on our genetic makeup. Epigenetics, therefore, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, offering a dynamic perspective on biological inheritance.
D1-482	We consider a sparse random network of excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic depression. Furthermore to mimic the dynamics of a brain circuit in its first stages of development we introduce for each neuron correlations among in-degree and out-degree as well as among excitability and the corresponding total degree, We analyze the influence of single neuron stimulation and deletion on the collective dynamics of the network. We show the existence of a small group of neurons capable of controlling and even silencing the bursting activity of the network. These neurons form a functional clique since only their activation in a precise order and within specific time windows is capable to ignite population bursts.
D1-483	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence itself, instead, modifies how cells read the genetic code. This process, influenced by factors like age, environment, and lifestyle, can switch genes on or off, thus impacting cellular functions and, consequently, overall organism development and health. This dynamic interplay between DNA and its surrounding proteins and molecules offers fascinating insights into the complexities of heredity and the potential for cells to adapt and respond to their environment, a crucial aspect in understanding diseases as diverse as cancer and neurological disorders.
D1-484	Protein molecules in cells are synthesized by macromolecular machines called ribosomes. According to recent experimental data, we reduce the complexity of the ribosome and propose a model to express its activity in six main states. Using our model, we study the translation rate in different biological relevant situations in the presence of external force, and translation through the RNA double stranded region in the absence or presence of the external force. In the present study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that the ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor. Our findings could shed some light on understanding behaviors of the ribosome in biological conditions.
D1-485	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics is a fascinating frontier. Epigenetics, simply put, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can be passed on from one cell generation to another, yet they are reversible, offering a dynamic interplay between nature and nurture. Epigenetic changes play a crucial role in development, aging, and disease, providing a new lens through which we can explore the complexities of biology. This field promises profound implications for our understanding of heredity and the potential for novel therapeutic interventions.
D1-486	The lengths of the telomere regions of chromosomes in a population of cells are modelled using a chemical master equation formalism, from which the evolution of the average number of cells of each telomere length is extracted. In particular, the role of the telomere-elongating enzyme telomerase on these dynamics is investigated. We show that for biologically relevant rates of cell birth and death, one finds a critical rate, R_crit, of telomerase activity such that the total number of cells diverges. Further, R_crit is similar in magnitude to the rates of mitosis and cell death. The possible relationship of this result to replicative immortality and its associated hallmark of cancer is discussed.
D1-487	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, also known as the firefly squid, embodies a fascinating spectacle of underwater light shows. These cephalopods possess light-producing organs called photophores, which can flash, pulse, or fade, serving as camouflage or communication tools. Their ability to manipulate light aids in evading predators and attracting prey, showcasing the intricate balance of the ocean's ecosystem. The firefly squid's luminous display not only enhances our understanding of the mysterious deep-sea world but also sparks curiosity about the myriad of undiscovered marine species yet to be explored.
D1-488	"Recent electrophysiological experiments have shown that dopamine (D1) modulation of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency adaptation and enhances NMDA transmission. Using four models, from multicompartmental to integrate and fire, we examine the effects of these modulations on sustained (delay) activity in a reverberatory network. We find that D1 modulation may enable robust network bistability yielding selective reverberation among cells that code for a particular item or location. We further show that the tuning curve of such cells is sharpened, and that signal-to-noise ratio is increased. We postulate that D1 modulation affects the tuning of ""memory fields"" and yield efficient distributed dynamic representations."
D1-489	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a fundamental process, the lifeblood of Earth's ecosystems. This biochemical miracle, performed by green plants and some microorganisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, meticulously transformed into glucose and oxygen. This release of oxygen enriches our atmosphere, sustaining respiration and life forms beyond the photosynthesizing organisms. Photosynthesis, thus, is a symphony of energy transfer and chemical transformation, essential for life's continuous dance on this planet.
D1-490	Multicellular migration and pattern formation play important roles in developmental biology, cancer metastasis and wound healing. To understand the collective cell dynamics in three dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM), we have developed a simple and mechanical-based strategy, Diskoid In Geometrically Micropatterned ECM (DIGME). DIGME allows easy engineering of the shape of 3-D tissue organoid, the mesoscale ECM heterogeneity, and the fiber alignment of collagen-based ECM all at the same time. We have employed DIGME to study the collective cancer invasion and find that DIGME provides a powerful tool to probe three dimensional dynamics of tumor organoid in patterned microenvironment.
D1-491	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized the field, offering a precision-editing tool for DNA. This revolutionary technique, derived from bacterial defense mechanisms, enables scientists to accurately modify genomes, correct mutations, and even edit the genes of various organisms, including humans. This groundbreaking development holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even eradicating harmful pathogens. Furthermore, it opens doors to a deeper understanding of genetics and biology, paving the way for a future where humanity can manipulate its own genetic destiny. However, ethical considerations and potential misuse of this powerful technology require careful deliberation and stringent regulatory measures.
D1-492	Septins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are conserved from fungi to humans. Septins assemble into heterooligomeric complexes and higher-order structures with key roles in various cellular functions including cell migration and division. The mechanisms by which septins assemble and interact with other cytoskeletal elements like actin remain elusive. A powerful approach to address this question is by cell-free reconstitution of pu- rified cytoskeletal proteins combined with fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe procedures for the purification of recombinant Drosophila and human septin hexamers from Escherichia coli and reconstitution of actin-septin coassembly. These procedures can be used to compare assembly of Drosophila and human septins and their coassembly with the actin cytoskeleton by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.
D1-493	 In the fascinating realm of biology, symbiosis, a close and often long-term biological interaction between different organisms, continually captivates researchers. This intricate dance between species, whether mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic, has shaped our planet's diversity. For instance, consider the relationship between the oxpecker bird and the rhinoceros. The bird perches on the rhino's back, feeding on parasitic ticks, providing the rhino with an inadvertent tick-removal service. This seemingly odd pairing, a testament to nature's intricate balance, underscores the beauty and complexity of symbiotic relationships in the biosphere.
D1-494	Networks of contacts capable of spreading infectious diseases are often observed to be highly heterogeneous, with the majority of individuals having fewer contacts than the mean, and a significant minority having relatively very many contacts. We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full temporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the deterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an accurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations, even for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided the maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.
D1-495	 In marine ecosystems, the giant kelp forest thrives, a grand underwater spectacle of verdant fronds. This remarkable algae, Macrocystis pyrifera, is the largest brown seaweed species, growing up to 200 feet in length. Its intricate root system anchors the kelp forest to the ocean floor, while its buoyant blades sway gracefully in the currents, providing shelter and nourishment for a myriad of marine life. Small fish, invertebrates, and even sea otters find refuge among the kelp's tangled tendrils. The forest also plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration, absorbing an estimated 20 tons of carbon dioxide per acre annually. As climate change intensifies, the resilience and carbon-absorbing capacity of these underwater forests become increasingly vital in mitigating the effects of global warming.
D1-496	Recent genome and transcriptome sequencing projects have unveiled a plethora of highly structured RNA molecules as central mediators of cellular function. Single molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful tool for analyzing the temporal evolution of the global structure of individual RNA molecules, in pursuit of understanding their essential structure-dynamics-function relationships. In contrast to enzymatic and chemical footprinting, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, smFRET yields temporally resolved, quantitative information about single molecules rather than only time and ensemble averages of entire populations. This enables unique observations of transient and rare conformations under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions.
D1-497	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold immense significance. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring across populations, serve as genetic markers, providing insights into an organism's ancestry and susceptibility to diseases. For instance, a specific SNP may increase the risk of a certain type of cancer in one population, while another SNP may enhance resistance to malaria in another. These findings, when analyzed collectively, can aid in personalized medicine, genetic ancestry tracing, and evolutionary studies, underscoring the profound impact of SNPs on biological diversity and human health.
D1-498	Reliable in-silico design of synthetic gene networks necessitates novel approaches to model the process of protein synthesis under the influence of limited resources. We present such a novel protein synthesis model which originates from the Ribosome Flow Model and among other things describes the movement of RNA-polymerase and Ribosomes on mRNA and DNA templates respectively. By analyzing the convergence properties of this model based upon geometric considerations we present additional insights into the dynamic mechanisms of the process of protein synthesis. Further, we exemplarily show how this model can be used to evaluate the performance of synthetic gene circuits under different loading scenarios.
D1-499	 In the realm of genetics, the intriguing CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacteria, allows precise modifications of DNA sequences. By creating targeted double-stranded breaks in the DNA, it opens a window for correcting errors, inserting new genetic material, or even disabling harmful genes. This technique has immense potential in various fields, such as agriculture, medicine, and even conservation, offering the promise of curing genetic diseases, enhancing crop resistance to pests, and preventing the extinction of endangered species. Nevertheless, the ethical implications of this powerful technology must also be carefully considered to ensure its responsible application.
D1-500	In this study, spatial stochastic and logistic model (SSLM) describing dynamics of a population of a certain species was analysed. The behaviour of the extinction threshold as a function of model parameters was studied. More specifically, we studied how the critical values for the model parameters that separate the cases of extinction and persistence depend on the spatial scales of the competition and dispersal kernels. We compared the simulations and analytical results to examine if and how the mathematical approximations break down at the vicinity of the extinction threshold, and found a functional form of the naive approximation for which higher-order term of analytical approximation converges.
D1-501	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring in non-coding regions, can subtly alter gene expression, impacting traits and predisposing individuals to certain diseases. For instance, a particular SNP in the APOE gene is linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, a SNP in the BRCA1 gene increases the likelihood of developing breast cancer. The study of these genetic markers allows for a more precise understanding of inherited susceptibility, paving the way for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.
D1-502	Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into account hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr
D1-503	 In the intricate world of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a revolutionary tool. This bacterial immune system, repurposed for gene editing, allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences. By using guide RNAs to target specific gene locations, the Cas9 enzyme can cut and rewrite DNA, offering novel possibilities in treating genetic diseases, enhancing crop yields, and even modifying traits in animals. However, as with any powerful technology, ethical considerations arise. The potential for human enhancement, genetic discrimination, and unintended consequences necessitate careful regulation to ensure responsible and equitable use.
D1-504	Self-assembly of protein monomers into distinct membrane protein oligomers provides a general mechanism for diversity in the molecular architectures, and resulting biological functions, of membrane proteins. We develop a general physical framework describing the thermodynamic competition between different oligomeric states of membrane proteins. Using the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance as a model system, we show how the dominant oligomeric states of membrane proteins emerge from the interplay of protein concentration in the cell membrane, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and direct monomer-monomer interactions. Our results suggest general physical mechanisms and principles underlying regulation of protein function via control of membrane protein oligomeric state.
D1-505	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics is a fascinating development. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these modifications are a complex interplay between the DNA molecule and proteins, influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. These modifications, affecting histones or DNA methylation, can influence gene expression and potentially impact cellular function, development, and response to disease. Epigenetics thus offers a dynamic perspective on genetic regulation, one that bridges the gap between our genes and our experiences, shedding light on the intricate interplay between nature and nurture in shaping biological outcomes.
D1-506	"In a previous paper, we examined a class of possible conformations for helically patterned filaments in contact with a bonding surface. In particular, we investigated geometries where contact between the pattern and the surface was improved through a periodic twisting and lifting of the filament. A consequence of this lifting is that the total length of the filament projected onto the surface decreases after bonding. When the bonding character of the surface is actuated, this phenomenon can lead to both lifelike ""inchworm"" behavior of the filaments and ensemble movement. We illustrate, through simulation, how pattern formation may be achieved through this mechanism."
D1-507	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the notion of epigenetics holds a significant place. Epigenetics, a layer above our DNA sequence, alters gene expression without modifying the underlying DNA itself. It's a dynamic process influenced by various factors like age, environment, and lifestyle choices. For instance, dietary habits, stress levels, and exposure to toxins can induce epigenetic changes, which in turn influence cellular functions and potentially, an individual's health and susceptibility to diseases. This field, once considered an obscure niche, is now recognized as a crucial intermediary in understanding heredity, development, and disease progression.
D1-508	We introduce and analyze a model for osmotically spreading biofilm colonies at solid-air interfaces that includes wetting phenomena, i.e. surface forces. The model combines a hydrodynamic description for biologically passive liquid suspensions with bioactive processes. We show that wetting effects are responsible for a transition between persistent and arrested spreading and provide experimental evidence for the existence of this transition for Bacillus subtilis biofilms growing on agar substrates. In the case of arrested spreading, the biofilm is non-invasive albeit being biologically active. However, a small reduction in the surface tension of the biofilm is sufficient to induce spreading.
D1-509	 In the realm of molecular biology, the study of DNA replication is paramount. This process, akin to a meticulous blueprint copying, ensures the transmission of genetic information from parent cells to offspring. The replication fork, a temporary structure, unfolds the double helix, and enzymes like helicase, topoisomerase, and DNA polymerase participate in this intricate dance. DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl end of an existing strand, creating two identical daughter strands. Thus, DNA replication underpins the very essence of life, enabling the propagation of genes and cellular continuity.
D1-510	100 years after Smoluchowski introduces his approach to stochastic processes, they are now at the basis of mathematical and physical modeling in cellular biology: they are used for example to analyse and to extract features from large number (tens of thousands) of single molecular trajectories or to study the diffusive motion of molecules, proteins or receptors. Stochastic modeling is a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology concepts. We review here the Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes and provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying polymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss the stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic gene regulation.
D1-511	 In marine ecology, the symbiotic relationship between sea anemones and clownfish is a captivating example of mutualism. Clownfish find refuge within the anemone's tentacles, protected from predators, while the anemone benefits from the removal of parasites and algae on the fish's body. This partnership is further strengthened by the clownfish's ability to deter anemone-eating fish, thus ensuring the anemone's survival. This symbiotic duo showcases an intricate balance in nature, where each species has a vital role in maintaining the other's existence.
D1-512	Although redistribution of red blood cells at bifurcated vessels is highly dependent on flow rate, it is still challenging to quantitatively express the dependency of flow rate in plasma skimming due to nonlinear cellular interactions. We suggest a plasma skimming model that can involve the effect of fractional blood flow at each bifurcation point. For validating the new model, it is compared with \textit{in vivo} data at single bifurcation points, as well as microvascular network systems. In the simulation results, the exponential decay of plasma skimming parameter, $M$, along fractional flow rate shows the best performance in both cases.
D1-513	 In the realm of genetic diversity, the African baobab tree stands as a testament to nature's resilience and adaptability. Its massive trunk, capable of storing up to 100,000 liters of water, is a marvel of evolution, enabling it to thrive in arid regions. The African baobab tree is an example of polyploidy, a process where multiple sets of chromosomes coexist within a single cell. This genetic complexity lends the tree enhanced tolerance to drought, heat, and poor soil conditions, making it an indomitable symbol of survival in the African savannah. Its seeds, rich in nutrients, sustain wildlife and human populations during lean seasons, further underscoring its vital role in the ecosystem.
D1-514	Finding the origin of slow and infra-slow oscillations could reveal or explain brain mechanisms in health and disease. Here, we present a biophysically constrained computational model of a neural network where the inclusion of astrocytes introduced slow and infra-slow-oscillations, through two distinct mechanisms. Specifically, we show how astrocytes can modulate the fast network activity through their slow inter-cellular calcium wave speed and amplitude and possibly cause the oscillatory imbalances observed in diseases commonly known for such abnormalities, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression and ischemic stroke. This work aims to increase our knowledge on how astrocytes and neurons synergize to affect brain function and dysfunction.
D1-515	 In the realm of genetics, a significant breakthrough occurred with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology.

For agricultural applications, CRISPR can enhance crop yields by enhancing resistance to pests and diseases, or by modifying nutritional content. However, ethical considerations arise when discussing human germline editing, questioning the boundaries of human manipulation and the potential unintended consequences of altering the genetic blueprint of future generations. Despite these concerns, the vast potential of CRISPR-Cas9 lies in its capacity to transform our understanding and control of heredity, opening doors to unparalleled advancements in medicine, agriculture, and beyond.
D1-516	Muon Spin Rotation is employed to investigate the spin dynamics of ferritin proteins isolated from the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient and of a healthy control, using a sample of horse-spleen ferritin as a reference. A model based on the N\'eel theory of superparamagnetism is developed in order to interpret the spin relaxation rate of the muons stopped by the core of the protein. Using this model, our preliminary observations show that ferritins from the healthy control are filled with a mineral compatible with ferrihydrite, while ferritins from the AD patient contain a crystalline phase with a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy, possibly compatible with magnetite or maghemite.
D1-517	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of gene regulation assumes a pivotal role. This process, orchestrated by various molecular mechanisms, determines when, where, and at what level a gene is expressed. Enzymes like histones and transcription factors, as well as non-coding RNAs, act as regulators, binding to specific DNA sequences to either activate or inhibit gene expression. This delicate dance of gene expression governs cellular function and development, ultimately shaping the complexities of life. Understanding gene regulation holds immense potential for advancing medicine, as interventions could target these mechanisms for treating genetic disorders and cancer, offering a promising path towards personalized medicine.
D1-518	The propagation of a beneficial mutation in a spatially extended population is usually studied using the phenomenological stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov (SFKPP) equation. We derive here an individual based, stochastic model founded on the spatial Moran process where fluctuations are treated exactly. At high selection pressure, the results of this model are different from the classical FKPP. At small selection pressure, the front behavior can be mapped into a Brownian motion with drift, the properties of which can be derived from microscopic parameters of the Moran model. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient and the noise amplitude of SFKPP are not independent parameters but are both determined by the dispersal kernel of individuals.
D1-519	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system revolutionizes molecular biology. This tool, harnessing bacterial immune defenses, enables precise genetic editing. It functions by introducing a guide RNA to locate specific DNA sequences, followed by a Cas9 enzyme that cuts the DNA strand at the target site. Post-editing, the cell's natural repair mechanisms introduce new DNA, offering an opportunity for genetic modification. The implications are vast, from treating genetic diseases to improving crop resistance and even potentially eradicating malaria-carrying mosquitoes. This game-changing technology, however, also raises ethical concerns about its use in human embryos and the potential for genetic disparities.
D1-520	The complicated, evolving landscape of cancer mutations poses a formidable challenge to identify cancer genes among the large lists of mutations typically generated in NGS experiments. The ability to prioritize these variants is therefore of paramount importance. To address this issue we developed OncoScore, a text-mining tool that ranks genes according to their association with cancer, based on available biomedical literature. Receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) metrics on manually curated datasets confirmed the excellent discriminating capability of OncoScore (OncoScore cut-off threshold = 21.09. AUC = 90.3%, 95% CI: 88.1-92.5%), indicating that OncoScore provides useful results in cases where an efficient prioritization of cancer-associated genes is needed.

This technological breakthrough allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences, opening doors to curing genetic diseases, improving crops, and even enhancing animal breeding. By harnessing the immune system of bacteria, scientists manipulate specific genes, correcting errors and inserting desired traits. However, ethical dilemmas arise as we ponder the implications of human gene editing, sparking debates about the potential for 'designer babies' and the line between natural evolution and human intervention. As we navigate this new frontier, it's crucial to balance the extraordinary benefits with responsible use and careful consideration of the potential consequences.
D1-522	Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions critically rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow this fundamental law and require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force-spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity and allostery of nucleic acids, proteins and peptides in a model-independent fashion. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.
D1-523	 In the intricate world of molecular biology, a pivotal actor is the enzyme DNA polymerase. This versatile catalyst plays a crucial role in the replication and repair of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), enabling the continuity of genetic information. DNA polymerase harnesses the energy from nucleotides to synthesize a new strand of DNA, ensuring the exact fidelity of genetic code. Beyond replication, it also mends DNA damage, safeguarding the integrity of our genetic blueprint. This enzymatic workhorse, a product of millions of years of evolution, is an undeniable testament to nature's ingenious design.
D1-524	We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal networks, based on chains with unbounded memory. This relation allows us to predict the influence of a weak amplitude time-dependent external stimuli on spatio-temporal spike correlations, from the spontaneous statistics (without stimulus) in a general context where the memory in spike dynamics can extend arbitrarily far in the past. Using this approach, we show how linear response is explicitly related to neuronal dynamics with an example, the gIF model, introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe. This example illustrates the collective effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity on spike statistics. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations.
D1-525	 In the realm of genetic diversity, the intricate dance between mutation and selection orients evolutionary trajectories. Mutations, spontaneous alterations in DNA, introduce novel traits, potentially advantageous or harmful. Selection, driven by environmental pressures, favors traits that enhance survival and reproduction, gradually reshaping populations. This interplay between mutation and selection shapes the adaptive landscape, a complex terrain of fitness peaks and valleys, guiding evolution towards optimal solutions. As organisms traverse this terrain, the emergence of new species and the preservation of existing ones are orchestrated by the delicate balance of these fundamental biological processes.
D1-526	We present a new method for the separation of superimposed, independent, auto-correlated components from noisy multi-channel measurement. The presented method simultaneously reconstructs and separates the components, taking all channels into account and thereby increases the effective signal-to-noise ratio considerably, allowing separations even in the high noise regime. Characteristics of the measurement instruments can be included, allowing for application in complex measurement situations. Independent posterior samples can be provided, permitting error estimates on all desired quantities. Using the concept of information field theory, the algorithm is not restricted to any dimensionality of the underlying space or discretization scheme thereof.
D1-527	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 stands out as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacterial immunity, allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences. By designing guide RNA to target specific gene locations, scientists can either edit, delete, or add new genetic material. This technology holds immense potential, promising treatments for genetic diseases, crop improvement, and even the fight against antibiotic resistance. However, ethical concerns persist, with debates centered around the potential misuse of this powerful technology and its impact on human evolution. As we navigate this exciting frontier, striking a balance between scientific advancement and ethical responsibility is crucial.
D1-528	A grand canonical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is presented for studying the lattice gas model (LGM) of multiple protein sequence alignment, which coherently combines long-range interactions and variable-length insertions. MC simulations are used for both parameter optimization of the model and production runs to explore the sequence subspace around a given protein family. In this Note, I describe the details of the MC algorithm as well as some preliminary results of MC simulations with various temperatures and chemical potentials, and compare them with the mean-field approximation. The existence of a two-state transition in the sequence space is suggested for the SH3 domain family, and inappropriateness of the mean-field approximation for the LGM is demonstrated.
D1-529	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold significant implications. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found between individuals, can determine traits, predispose diseases, and even influence responses to medication. For instance, a particular SNP in the CYP2D6 gene affects the metabolism of certain drugs, rendering some individuals as 'ultra-rapid' or 'poor' metabolizers. This genetic diversity, once obscure, is now being harnessed to tailor medical treatments towards individual genetic profiles, revolutionizing healthcare and ushering in a new era of personalized medicine.
D1-530	We present a novel extended-focus optical coherence microscope (OCM) attaining 0.7 {\mu}m axial and 0.4 {\mu}m lateral resolution maintained over a depth of 40 {\mu}m, while preserving the advantages of Fourier domain OCM. Our method uses an ultra-broad spectrum from a super- continuum laser source. As the spectrum spans from near-infrared to visible wavelengths (240 nm in bandwidth), we call the method visOCM. The combination of such a broad spectrum with a high-NA objective creates an almost isotropic 3D submicron resolution. We analyze the imaging performance of visOCM on microbead samples and demonstrate its image quality on cell cultures and ex-vivo mouse brain tissue.
D1-531	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) holds significant sway. An SNP, a difference in a single DNA building block, can subtly alter gene function or protein production, contributing to genetic diversity among individuals. These variants, spread across the human genome, play a pivotal role in determining traits, susceptibility to diseases, and responses to medications. As our understanding of SNPs deepens, so does the potential for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, promising a future where healthcare becomes more precise and effective.
D1-532	Asymmetric $\rm \beta$-sheet protein structures in spider silk should induce nonlinear optical interaction such as second harmonic generation (SHG) which is experimentally observed for a radial line and dragline spider silk by using an imaging femtosecond laser SHG microscope. By comparing different spider silks, we found that the SHG signal correlates with the existence of the protein $\rm \beta$-sheets. Measurements of the polarization dependence of SHG from the dragline indicated that the $\rm \beta$-sheet has a nonlinear response depending on the direction of the incident electric field. We propose a model of what orientation the $\rm \beta$-sheet takes in spider silk.
D1-533	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, essential for survival on our planet. This biochemical reaction, performed primarily by green plants and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. These carbohydrates fuel the organisms themselves, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct, a vital resource for respiration in most other life forms. In essence, photosynthesis is the life-sustaining dance between the sun, green plants, and the air we breathe, an enduring testament to the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-534	It is generally difficult to predict the positions of mutations in genomic DNA at the nucleotide level. Retroviral DNA insertion is one mode of mutation, resulting in host infections that are difficult to treat. This mutation process involves the integration of retroviral DNA into the host-infected cellular genomic DNA following the interaction between host DNA and a pre-integration complex consisting of retroviral DNA and integrase. Here, we report that retroviral insertion sites around a hotspot within the Zfp521 and N-myc genes can be predicted by a periodic function that is deduced using the diffraction lattice model. In conclusion, the mutagenesis process is described by a biophysical model for DNA-DNA interactions.
D1-535	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the lifeblood of our planet. This biochemical reaction, exhibited primarily by plants and some microorganisms, converts light energy, mainly from the sun, into chemical energy through the synthesis of glucose molecules. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, transformed in chloroplasts, the green powerhouses within plant cells. Oxygen, a byproduct, is released, a vital component essential for respiration in most organisms. This symbiotic dance between sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and green plants sustains the majority of life on Earth, making photosynthesis a cornerstone of our global ecosystem.
D1-536	A theoretical analysis of the unfolding pathway of simple modular proteins in length- controlled pulling experiments is put forward. Within this framework, we predict the first module to unfold in a chain of identical units, emphasizing the ranges of pulling speeds in which we expect our theory to hold. These theoretical predictions are checked by means of steered molecular dynamics of a simple construct, specifically a chain composed of two coiled-coils motives, where anisotropic features are revealed. These simulations also allow us to give an estimate for the range of pulling velocities in which our theoretical approach is valid.
D1-537	 In the intricate web of life, symbiosis, a close and often long-term interaction between different biological organisms, plays a pivotal role. This relationship, unlike competition or predation, benefits both parties involved. For instance, consider the relationship between coral and zooanthids. The coral provides a hard, calcium carbonate structure for the zooanthids to reside in, while the zooanthids assist in capturing food through their tentacles, aiding the coral's survival. This mutualistic relationship is essential for the health and growth of coral reefs, which are home to a quarter of all marine species. Symbiosis, thus, underscores the interconnectedness of life, emphasizing the importance of cooperation in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem balance.
D1-538	There does not exist a general positive correlation between important life-supporting properties and the entropy production rate. The simple reason is that nondissipative and time-symmetric kinetic aspects are also relevant for establishing optimal functioning. In fact those aspects are even crucial in the nonlinear regimes around equilibrium where we find biological processing on mesoscopic scales. We make these claims specific via examples of molecular motors, of circadian cycles and of sensory adaptation, whose performance in some regimes is indeed spoiled by increasing the dissipated power. We use the relation between dissipation and the amount of time-reversal breaking to keep the discussion quantitative also in effective models where the physical entropy production is not clearly identifiable.
D1-539	 In the intricate world of genetics, the X chromosome plays a pivotal role, particularly in sex determination. Females, possessing two X chromosomes, carry a diverse genetic makeup due to random inactivation of one X chromosome in each cell. Males, with an X and a Y chromosome, lack this genetic redundancy, making them more susceptible to X-linked genetic disorders. Interestingly, this sex-linked trait variance has been instrumental in studies of human inheritance patterns and genetic research. Furthermore, the X chromosome houses numerous genes essential for cognitive functions, immunity, and various physiological processes, revealing its profound impact on overall health and development.
D1-540	Many proteoforms - arising from alternative splicing, post-translational modifications (PTMs), or paralogous genes - have distinct biological functions, such as histone PTM proteoforms. However, their quantification by existing bottom-up mass-spectrometry (MS) methods is undermined by peptide-specific biases. To avoid these biases, we developed and implemented a first-principles model (HIquant) for quantifying proteoform stoichiometries. We characterized when MS data allow inferring proteoform stoichiometries by HIquant, derived an algorithm for optimal inference, and demonstrated experimentally high accuracy in quantifying fractional PTM occupancy without using external standards, even in the challenging case of the histone modification code.   HIquant server is implemented at: https://web.northeastern.edu/slavov/2014_HIquant/
D1-541	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, also known as the flying squid, showcases a remarkable display of light in the ocean depths. Equipped with photophores, these creatures emit a soft glow to camouflage, confuse predators, or communicate. During reproduction, males release a glowing sperm bundle, which the female guides using her own light organ. This captivating dance of light, hidden beneath the vast ocean, illuminates the intricate interplay of life in the deep sea, offering scientists a glimpse into one of Earth's most enigmatic ecosystems.
D1-542	Various approaches to alignment-free sequence comparison are based on the length of exact or inexact word matches between two input sequences. Haubold {\em et al.} (2009) showed how the average number of substitutions between two DNA sequences can be estimated based on the average length of exact common substrings. In this paper, we study the length distribution of $k$-mismatch common substrings between two sequences. We show that the number of substitutions per position that have occurred since two sequences have evolved from their last common ancestor, can be estimated from the position of a local maximum in the length distribution of their $k$-mismatch common substrings.
D1-543	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a game-changer. This system, derived from bacteria, allows precise modifications to DNA sequences, offering unprecedented control over genetic material. By cutting and pasting DNA at specific locations, researchers can correct genetic mutations, alter gene functions, or even introduce new traits. This technology holds immense potential for combating genetic diseases, improving crop yield, and even revitalizing endangered species. However, ethical considerations loom large, as the ability to edit the human germline could potentially lead to designer babies, sparking debates about the boundaries of human manipulation. As we tread this exciting new frontier, it's crucial to navigate these ethical dilemmas with careful deliberation, ensuring the benefits of CRISPR-Cas9 are harnessed responsibly for the betterment of humanity.
D1-544	Elastic confinements are an important component of many biological systems and dictate the transport properties of suspended particles under flow. In this chapter, we review the Brownian motion of a particle moving in the vicinity of a living cell whose membrane is endowed with a resistance towards shear and bending. The analytical calculations proceed through the computation of the frequency-dependent mobility functions and the application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Elastic interfaces endow the system with memory effects that lead to a long-lived anomalous subdiffusive regime of nearby particles. In the steady limit, the diffusional behavior approaches that near a no-slip hard wall. The analytical predictions are validated and supplemented with boundary-integral simulations.

By harnessing the power of this natural bacterial defense mechanism, scientists can correct genetic mutations, combat diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, and even modify crops to enhance food security. Yet, beyond its therapeutic applications, CRISPR-Cas9 opens doors to vast biological discoveries, from understanding the intricate workings of genes to unraveling the mysteries of evolution. This groundbreaking technology, therefore, not only promises to revolutionize medicine but also to reshape our comprehension of life at its very core.
D1-546	We study the buckling of an idealized, semiflexible filament along whose contour magnetic moments are placed. {We give analytic expressions for the critical stiffness of the filament below which it buckles due to the magnetic compression. For this, we consider various scenarios of the attachment of the magnetic particles to the filament. One possible application for this model are the magnetosome chains of magnetotactic bacteria. An estimate of the critical bending stiffness indicates that buckling may occur within the range of biologically relevant parameters and suggests a role for the bending stiffness of the filament to stabilize the filament against buckling, which would compromise the functional relevance of the bending stiffness of the used filament.

This groundbreaking technology holds immense promise for the future, with applications stretching from medicine to agriculture, revolutionizing the way we understand, manipulate, and harness the power of life's blueprint.
D1-548	Photothermal effects of gold core-shell nanoparticles and nanorods dispersed in water are theoretically investigated using the transient bioheat equation and the extended Mie theory. Properly calculating the absorption cross section is an extremely crucial milestone to determine the elevation of solution temperature. The nanostructures are assumed to be randomly and uniformly distributed in the solution. Compared to previous experiments, our theoretical temperature increase during laser light illumination provides, in various systems, both reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement. This approach can be a highly reliable tool to predict photothermal effects in experimentally unexplored structures. We also validate our approach and discuss its limitations.

In this Letter we describe the results of off-lattice Lotka-Volterra stochastic simulations, showing that the emergence of spiral patterns does occur for sufficiently high values of the (conserved) total density of individuals. We also investigate the dynamics in our simulations, finding an empirical relation characterizing the dependence of the characteristic peak frequency and amplitude on the total density. Finally, we study the impact of the total density on the extinction probability, showing how a low population density may jeopardize biodiversity.
D1-551	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert a profound effect. These minute variations, occurring across the DNA sequence, influence traits and predispose individuals to certain diseases. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while the GSTP1 polymorphism modifies prostate cancer susceptibility. As we delve deeper into the human genome, understanding these SNPs could lead to personalized medicine, tailoring treatment to an individual's unique genetic makeup, thereby improving health outcomes. This knowledge, however, also raises ethical dilemmas, as the potential for genetic discrimination looms. Balancing the benefits of genetic information with the protection of individual privacy remains a pressing concern in the era of genomic medicine.
D1-552	Brain plasticity refers to brain's ability to change neuronal connections, as a result of environmental stimuli, new experiences, or damage. In this work, we study the effects of the synaptic delay on both the coupling strengths and synchronisation in a neuronal network with synaptic plasticity. We build a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, where the plasticity is given by the Hebbian rules. We verify that without time delay the excitatory synapses became stronger from the high frequency to low frequency neurons and the inhibitory synapses increases in the opposite way, when the delay is increased the network presents a non-trivial topology. Regarding the synchronisation, only for small values of the synaptic delay this phenomenon is observed.
D1-553	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a beacon of hope. This system, derived from bacterial immunity, allows for precise editing of DNA sequences.

Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9 holds immense potential in agricultural biotechnology, enabling the enhancement of crop resistance to pests and diseases, thereby boosting food security. As we delve deeper into understanding and refining this technology, the possibilities are boundless, promising a future where genetic diseases are eradicated and the global food supply is fortified against environmental challenges.
D1-554	Mathematicians have always been attracted to the field of genetics. I am especially interested in the mathematical aspects of research on homosexuality. Certain studies show that male homosexuality may have a genetic component that is correlated with female fertility. Other studies show the existence of the fraternal birth order effect, that is the correlation of homosexuality with the number of older brothers.   This paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of how these two phenomena are interconnected. In particular, I show that the fraternal birth order effect produces a correlation between homosexuality and maternal fecundity. Vice versa, I show that the correlation between homosexuality and female fecundity implies the increase of the probability of the younger brothers being homosexual.

Found in deep-sea habitats, it possesses light-producing organs called photophores, which enable it to create intricate patterns of light for communication, camouflage, or luring prey. Its unique method of swimming, resembling the earflaps of Disney's Dumbo, further adds to its captivating appearance. The dumbo octopus's adaptation to life in the dark abyss showcases the incredible diversity and resilience of life in our oceans.
D1-556	The need for high-throughput, precise, and meaningful methods for measuring behavior has been amplified by our recent successes in measuring and manipulating neural circuitry. The largest challenges associated with moving in this direction, however, are not technical but are instead conceptual: what numbers should one put on the movements an animal is performing (or not performing)? In this review, I will describe how theoretical and data analytical ideas are interfacing with recently-developed computational and experimental methodologies to answer these questions across a variety of contexts, length scales, and time scales. I will attempt to highlight commonalities between approaches and areas where further advances are necessary to place behavior on the same quantitative footing as other scientific fields.
D1-557	 In the intricate realm of genetics, DNA serves as the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each DNA strand is a sequence of four bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The order of these bases forms genes, which determine an organism's traits. Genes, furthermore, are grouped into chromosomes, with humans having 23 pairs. These chromosomes, during cell division, ensure accurate distribution of genetic information, maintaining the integrity of life from one generation to the next. This fundamental understanding of DNA and its role in genetics revolutionized the scientific world, offering new possibilities for improving human health and understanding the complexities of life.
D1-558	This paper presents a novel optical processing approach for exploring genome sequences built upon optical correlator for global alignment and extended DV-curve method for local alignment. To overcome the problem of traditional DV-curve method for presenting an accurate and simplified output, we propose HAWPOD, built upon DV- curve method, to analyze genome sequences in five steps: DNA coding, alignment, noise cancellation, simplification, and modification. Moreover, all-optical implementation of the HAWPOD method is developed, while its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations in LUMERICAL FDTD. The results express the proposed method is much faster than its electrical counterparts, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tools.
D1-559	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant shift in our understanding of heredity. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, these changes are the result of chemical modifications to DNA and its packaging proteins, known as histones. These modifications can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, thus making genes more or less active. Epigenetic changes play a crucial role in cellular differentiation, imprinting, X-inactivation, and cancer development, providing a bridge between gene and environment interactions. This dynamic interplay underscores the complexity of biological systems and opens up new avenues for research in areas such as disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
D1-560	This paper presents a comprehensive list of the scientific articles of Giulio Fermi (1936-1997), son of the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, published between 1962 and 1997. The initial research activity of Giulio was concerned with virology and biological cybernetics while, from 1975 onward, his work was completely devoted to protein crystallography. The crystallographic research was carried out in collaboration with Nobel laureate Max Perutz at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge (United Kingdom). A short biography of Giulio (Judd) Fermi appears inside John Finch's book A Nobel Fellow on Every Floor: A History of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology published by the MRC in 2008.
D1-561	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it's about modifications to the packaging of DNA, such as methylation or acetylation, which can influence which genes are 'on' or 'off.' These changes can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, lifestyle, and disease. These modifications can be heritable, meaning they can be passed down from one generation to the next, adding a layer of complexity to the study of genetics. Epigenetics offers a fascinating perspective on how our genes can be influenced by external factors, potentially providing new avenues for understanding and treating diseases.
D1-562	"Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. Reproduction depends on the payoff a strategy receives. The payoff depends on the environment that may change over time, on intrinsic uncertainties, and on other sources of randomness. These temporal variations in the payoffs can affect which traits evolve. Understanding evolutionary game dynamics that are affected by varying payoffs remains difficult. Here we study the impact of arbitrary amplitudes and covariances of temporally varying payoffs on the dynamics. The evolutionary dynamics may be ""unfair"", meaning that, on average, two coexisting strategies may persistently receive different payoffs. This mechanism can induce an anomalous coexistence of cooperators and defectors in the Prisoner's Dilemma, and an unexpected selection reversal in the Hawk-Dove game."
D1-563	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system emerges as a revolutionary tool, redefining the boundaries of gene editing. This innovative approach, derived from bacterial immune systems, enables precise alterations to DNA sequences, opening avenues for treating genetic disorders, enhancing crops, and even combating diseases at their roots. By harnessing the power of guide RNAs and the Cas9 enzyme, researchers can now efficiently and accurately manipulate genes in various organisms, transforming our understanding and control over heredity. This groundbreaking technology promises a future where genetic diseases are eradicated, and life as we know it is significantly improved.
D1-564	A practical, biologically motivated case of protein complexes (immunoglobulin G and FcRII receptors) moving on the surface of mastcells, that are common parts of an immunological system, is investigated. Proteins are considered as nanomachines creating a nanonetwork. Accurate molecular models of the proteins and the fluorophores which act as their nanoantennas are used to simulate the communication between the nanomachines when they are close to each other. The theory of diffusion-based Brownian motion is applied to model movements of the proteins. It is assumed that fluorophore molecules send and receive signals using the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer. The probability of the efficient signal transfer and the respective bit error rate are calculated and discussed.
D1-565	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating exploration unfolds with the study of epigenetics. This discipline delves into alterations in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it focuses on modifications such as methylation and histone structure, which can influence how genes are 'read' and, consequently, impact traits and behaviors. For instance, these changes can determine whether a gene is active or inactive, potentially affecting developmental processes, disease susceptibility, and even responses to environmental factors. This dynamic interplay between genes and their environment adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of biology, bridging the gap between nature and nurture.
D1-566	Double-stranded DNA may contain mismatched base pairs beyond the Watson-Crick pairs guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine. Such mismatches bear adverse consequences for human health. We utilize molecular dynamics and metadynamics computer simulations to study the equilibrium structure and dynamics for both matched and mismatched base pairs. We discover significant differences between matched and mismatched pairs in structure, hydrogen bonding, and base flip work profiles. Mismatched pairs shift further in the plane normal to the DNA strand and are more likely to exhibit non-canonical structures, including the e-motif. We discuss potential implications on mismatch repair enzymes' detection of DNA mismatches.
D1-567	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the vampire squid, exhibits a unique adaptation to its deep-sea environment. Unlike other squid species, it does not produce its own light. instead, it harbors bioluminescent bacteria within its webbed arms. By manipulating these bacteria, the vampire squid creates intricate patterns of light, possibly to confuse predators or attract prey. This symbiotic relationship between the squid and bacteria is a fascinating example of co-evolution and adaptation in the dark, mysterious depths of the ocean.
D1-568	"Eshel Ben-Jacob, one of the co-organizers of this meeting on collective behavior and one of the pioneers in the field of collective behavior in biology, passed away suddenly just before we convened. This article presents a brief glimpse of Eshel's life-long path through science, seen from the perspective of a decades long collaboration on many disparate yet ultimately connected topics. The article attempts to convey how the concept of self-organization of complex interacting objects into higher order functional units, as evidenced so wonderfully by Eshel's experiments on bacterial colony formation, provides a unifying theme for the study of collective behavior. Our entire field will miss his unique ability to ""let the complex become simple""."
D1-569	 Amidst the vibrant tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process, the life-giving dance between plants and sunlight. This intricate biochemical dance unfolds in the chloroplasts, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment, plays a pivotal role, absorbing light energy and facilitating this transformation. Photosynthesis not only nourishes plants but also oxygenates our atmosphere, sustaining the very existence of aerobic life forms on Earth. This delicate balance between sunlight, carbon, and water serves as a testament to the harmonious, interconnected web of life, reminding us of our dependence on the natural world.
D1-570	This paper reports nano-CT analysis of brain tissues of schizophrenia and control cases. The analysis revealed that: (1) neuronal structures vary between individuals, (2) the mean curvature of distal neurites of the schizophrenia cases was 1.5 times higher than that of the controls, and (3) dendritic spines were categorized into two geometrically distinctive groups, though no structural differences were observed between the disease and control cases. The differences in the neurite curvature result in differences in the spatial trajectory and hence alter neuronal circuits. We suggest that the structural alteration of neurons in the schizophrenia cases should reflect psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia.
D1-571	 In botany, the process of pollination is a vital aspect of plant reproduction. This natural phenomenon involves the transfer of pollen grains from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. Wind, animals, and insects are common agents of pollination. For instance, bees, attracted by the nectar, carry pollen from one flower to another during their foraging activities, thus facilitating cross-pollination, a key driver of genetic diversity among plant species. Pollination not only ensures the continuation of plant life but also contributes significantly to food production, as many agricultural crops rely on this process for fruit and seed formation.
D1-572	Managing blood lipid levels is important for the treatment and prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. An easy-to-use, portable lipid blood test will accelerate more frequent testing by patients and at-risk populations. We used smartphone systems that are already familiar to many people. Because smartphone systems can be carried around everywhere, blood can be measured easily and frequently. We compared the results of lipid tests with those of existing clinical diagnostic laboratory methods. We found that smartphone-based point-of-care lipid blood tests are as accurate as hospital-grade laboratory tests. Our system will be useful for those who need to manage blood lipid levels to motivate them to track and control their behavior.
D1-573	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucial role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not mere decorations but active predators. They capture prey with their stinging cells, a defense mechanism that also aids hunting. The mucus-like substance they secrete aids in capturing food particles suspended in water. Symbiotic relationships with zooxanthellae, single-celled algae, provide the anemone with nutrients, contributing to its vibrant coloration. Additionally, they serve as hosts to various species of clownfish, offering mutual protection and a shared habitat. This interconnectedness highlights the intricate balance within marine ecosystems, where seemingly simple organisms can have profound impacts on their environment.
D1-574	In this study, we investigate a porous medium-type flux limited reaction--diffusion equation that arises in morphogenesis modeling. This nonlinear partial differential equation is an extension of the generalized Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovsky--Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation in one-dimensional space. The approximate analytical traveling wave solution is found by using a perturbation method. We show that the morphogen concentration propagates as a sharp wave front where the wave speed has a saturated value. The numerical solutions of this equation are also provided to compare them with the analytical predictions. Finally, we qualitatively compare our theoretical results with those obtained in experimental studies.
D1-575	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly alter an organism's phenotype. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at the gene level, can influence traits such as eye color, blood type, and susceptibility to diseases. The Human Genome Project, a monumental endeavor that mapped the entire human genome, has provided a comprehensive understanding of these SNPs, paving the way for personalized medicine and novel genetic therapies. Yet, the complexity of gene interactions and the environment's role in gene expression are still under investigation, underscoring the vast, ongoing journey of biological discovery.
D1-576	We discuss a less known aspect of Feynman's multifaceted scientific work, centered about his interest in molecular biology, which came out around 1959 and lasted for several years. After a quick historical reconstruction about the birth of molecular biology, we focus on Feynman's work on genetics with Robert S. Edgar in the laboratory of Max Delbruck, which was later quoted by Francis Crick and others in relevant papers, as well as in Feynman's lectures given at the Hughes Aircraft Company on biology, organic chemistry and microbiology, whose notes taken by the attendee John Neer are available. An intriguing perspective comes out about one of the most interesting scientists of the XX century.
D1-577	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the study of DNA sequencing unveils our unique biological blueprint. Each strand, a complex code of four nucleotides, serves as a template for protein synthesis, shaping the very essence of our existence. The Human Genome Project, a groundbreaking endeavor, deciphered over three billion base pairs, providing insights into heredity, disease susceptibility, and individual uniqueness. Yet, as we delve deeper into this vast genetic library, questions about epigenetics, gene regulation, and evolutionary adaptability arise, propelling us further into the uncharted territory of genomic research.
D1-578	Gene expression dynamics satisfying given input-output relationships were investigated by evolving the networks for an optimal response. We found three types of networks and corresponding dynamics, depending on the sensitivity of gene expression dynamics: direct response with straight paths, amplified response by a feed-forward network, and cooperative response with a complex network. When the sensitivity of each gene's response is low and expression dynamics is sloppy, the last type is selected, in which many genes respond collectively to inputs, with local-excitation and global-inhibition structures. The result provides an insight into how a reliable response is achieved with unreliable units, and on why complex networks with many genes are adopted in cells.
D1-579	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, the double helix structure of DNA stands as a testament to nature's ingenuity. This deoxyribonucleic acid stores the blueprint of life, encoding genetic information essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Each DNA strand is composed of nucleotides, four distinct bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) that pair up in a specific sequence, forming rungs on the ladder-like structure. This base pairing, coupled with the ability to replicate accurately, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, thereby maintaining the continuity of life.
D1-580	Molecular motors walk along filaments until they detach stochastically with a force-dependent unbinding rate. Here, we show that this unbinding rate can be obtained from the analysis of experimental data of molecular motors moving in stationary optical traps. Two complementary methods are presented, based on the analysis of the distribution for the unbinding forces and of the motor's force traces. In the first method, analytically derived force distributions for slip bonds, slip-ideal bonds, and catch bonds are used to fit the cumulative distributions of the unbinding forces. The second method is based on the statistical analysis of the observed force traces. We validate both methods with stochastic simulations and apply them to experimental data for kinesin-1.
D1-581	 In the realm of cellular biology, the mitochondrion, often dubbed the 'powerhouse of the cell', plays a pivotal role in energy production. This organelle, with its double membrane structure, is responsible for converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. The mitochondrion's efficiency in this process is crucial for sustaining life, as ATP fuels various cellular functions, from muscle contraction to DNA replication. Additionally, mitochondria are unique in their origins, believed to have evolved from free-living bacteria that were engulfed by ancient eukaryotic cells, a fascinating example of symbiotic relationships shaping the complexity of life.
D1-582	Cochlea displays complex and highly nonlinear behavior in response to wide-ranging auditory stimuli. While there have been many recent advancements in the modeling of cochlear dynamics, it remains unclear what mathematical structures underlie the essential features of the extended cochlea. We construct a dynamical system consisting of a series of strongly coupled critical oscillators to show that high-dimensional nonhyperbolic dynamics can account for high-order compressive nonlinearities, amplification of weak input, frequency selectivity, and traveling waves of activity. As a single Hopf bifurcation generically gives rise to features of cochlea at a local level, the nonhyperbolicity mechanism proposed in this paper can be seen as a higher-dimensional analogue for the entire extended cochlea.
D1-583	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert profound influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring at specific locations, serve as genetic markers. They can modulate gene expression, rendering individuals genetically unique. SNPs can predispose to certain diseases, influence drug metabolism, and even shape physical traits. For instance, the APOE4 SNP is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's, while the F508del SNP in the CFTR gene is associated with cystic fibrosis. Understanding SNPs can unlock the door to personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to an individual's genetic makeup, ultimately improving health outcomes.
D1-584	We extensively explore networks of weakly unbalanced, leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons for different coupling strength, connectivity, and by varying the degree of refractoriness, as well as the delay in the spike transmission. We find that the neural network does not only exhibit a microscopic (single-neuron) stochastic-like evolution, but also a collective irregular dynamics (CID). Our analysis is based on the computation of a suitable order parameter, typically used to characterize synchronization phenomena and on a detailed scaling analysis (i.e. simulations of different network sizes). As a result, we can conclude that CID is a true thermodynamic phase, intrinsically different from the standard asynchronous regime.
D1-585	" In the intricate realm of cellular biology, the mitochondria, often dubbed the ""powerhouse of the cell,"" play a pivotal role. These organelles, with their double-membrane structure, are responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of all life forms. The mitochondria's process of oxidative phosphorylation, a series of complex biochemical reactions, harnesses the energy stored in food to power cellular activities. This essential function underpins life, as without ATP, cells would be unable to perform the myriad tasks necessary for survival. The mitochondria's importance extends beyond energy production, as they are also involved in various signaling pathways, calcium homeostasis, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Thus, understanding and appreciating the mitochondria's diverse roles is crucial for grasping the intricate symphony of life at its most fundamental level."
D1-586	Phase microscopy is an invaluable tool in the biosciences and in clinical diagnostics. The sensitivity of current phase microscopy techniques is optimized for one specific mean phase value and varies significantly across a given sample. Here, we demonstrate a technique based on wavefront shaping that optimizes the sensitivity across the field of view and for arbitrary phase objects. A significant mean sensitivity enhancement is achieved, both for engineered test samples, as well as for red blood cells. Besides sensitivity enhancement, the technique homogenizes sensitivity, reduces typical phase imaging artifacts such as halos, and allows for quantitative single-frame microscopy, which potentially allows for imaging speedup as compared to other phase stepping techniques.
D1-587	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized molecular biology. This innovative tool, derived from bacteria's adaptive immune system, allows precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing the power of guide RNAs, scientists can target specific regions within a genome, introducing changes or corrections to genetic code. This technology holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even eradicating invasive species. However, the ethical implications are vast, raising questions about gene editing in humans. As we continue to unravel the intricacies of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, responsible and ethical application is paramount to ensure a bright and equitable future for all.
D1-588	We study the folding of RNA secondary structures with quenched sequence randomness by means of the constrained annealing method. A thermodynamic phase transition is induced by including the conformational weight of loop structures. In addition to the expected melting at high temperature, a cold melting transition appears. Our results suggest that the cold denaturation of RNA found experimentally is, in fact, a continuous phase transition triggered by quenched sequence disorder. We calculate both hot and cold melting critical temperatures for the competing energy scenario between favorable and unfavorable base pairs and present a phase diagram as a function of the loop exponent and temperature.
D1-589	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, a captivating cephalopod, displays an extraordinary spectacle under the ocean's depths. Equipped with photophores, these creatures emit a soft, pulsing light, a defense mechanism against predators or a tool for communication with their kin. The light is generated by a chemical reaction in the photophores, where the enzyme luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, producing a flash of blue-green light. This mesmerizing, natural light show, coupled with their rapid, agile movements, makes bioluminescent squids some of the most enigmatic and fascinating creatures in the deep sea.
D1-590	Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be able to reach sampling in the second timescale within five years, producing petabytes of simulation data at current force field accuracy. Notwithstanding this, MD will still be in the regime of low-throughput, high-latency predictions with average accuracy. We envisage that machine learning (ML) will be able to solve both the accuracy and time-to-prediction problem by learning predictive models using expensive simulation data. The synergies between classical, quantum simulations and ML methods, such as artificial neural networks, have the potential to drastically reshape the way we make predictions in computational structural biology and drug discovery.
D1-591	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This process, performed primarily by plants and algae, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is essential for aerobic organisms, sustaining the very breath that fuels their existence. Photosynthesis is a testament to nature's ingenious design, powering the food web, maintaining atmospheric balance, and driving the planet's life-sustaining cycle. This symphony of biochemical reactions not only nourishes our world but also serves as a potent reminder of the interconnectedness of all life forms.
D1-592	Neural field theory is used to quantitatively analyze the two-dimensional spatiotemporal correlation properties of gamma-band (30 -- 70 Hz) oscillations evoked by stimuli arriving at the primary visual cortex (V1), and modulated by patchy connectivities that depend on orientation preference (OP). Correlation functions are derived analytically under different stimulus and measurement conditions. The predictions reproduce a range of published experimental results, including the existence of two-point oscillatory temporal cross-correlations with zero time-lag between neurons with similar OP, the influence of spatial separation of neurons on the strength of the correlations, and the effects of differing stimulus orientations.
D1-593	 In the realm of molecular biology, the protein kinase C (PKC) family plays a pivotal role in cell signaling, particularly in response to extracellular stimuli. These enzymes phosphorylate various proteins, altering their functions and ultimately influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PKCs are divided into three main groups: classical, novel, and atypical, each exhibiting distinct calcium and phospholipid requirements. The diverse roles of PKCs in cellular regulation make them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions, particularly in diseases like cancer and neurological disorders.
D1-594	"We propose a unifying theoretical framework for the analysis of first-passage time distributions in two important classes of stochastic processes in which the diffusivity of a particle evolves randomly in time. In the first class of ""diffusing diffusivity"" models, the diffusivity changes continuously via a prescribed stochastic equation. In turn, the diffusivity switches randomly between discrete values in the second class of ""switching diffusion"" models. For both cases, we quantify the impact of the diffusivity dynamics onto the first-passage time distribution of a particle via the moment-generating function of the integrated diffusivity. We provide general formulas and some explicit solutions for some particular cases of practical interest."
D1-595	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) serves as a silent yet profound player. These minute differences in DNA sequence can have significant implications, influencing traits, diseases, and responses to drugs. SNPs, occurring once in every 100-300 bases, are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. They are often associated with complex conditions like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding SNPs can illuminate our genetic heritage, offering insights into the evolutionary history of species and paving the way for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.
D1-596	We review the key role played by mathematical modelling in elucidating two centre-finding patterning systems in E. coli: midcell division positioning by the MinCDE system and DNA partitioning by the ParABS system. We focus particularly on how, despite much experimental effort, these systems were simply too complex to unravel by experiments alone, and instead required key injections of quantitative, mathematical thinking. We conclude the review by analysing the frequency of modelling approaches in microbiology over time. We find that while such methods are increasing in popularity, they are still probably heavily under-utilised for optimal progress on complex biological questions.
D1-597	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis serves as a cornerstone, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen within plant cells. This process is essential for not only plant survival but also for sustaining the entire planet's ecosystem. The chloroplast, a tiny, membrane-bound organelle within plant cells, hosts the green pigment chlorophyll, which plays a vital role in the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis. This process is more than just a simple energy conversion. it is a symphony of life, powering the growth of flora, producing oxygen for fauna, and creating the foundation for the food chain. The delicate balance of photosynthesis underscores the interconnectedness of all life on Earth.
D1-598	Quantitative studies of cell metabolism are often based on large chemical reaction network models. A steady state approach is suited to analyze phenomena on the timescale of cell growth and circumvents the problem of incomplete experimental knowledge on kinetic laws and parameters, but it shall be supported by a correct implementation of thermodynamic constraints. In this article we review the latter aspect highlighting its computational challenges and physical insights. The simple introduction of Gibbs inequalities avoids the presence of unfeasible loops allowing for correct timescale analysis but leads to possibly non-convex feasible flux spaces, whose exploration needs efficient algorithms. We shorty review on the implementation of thermodynamics through variational principles in constraints based models of metabolic networks.
D1-599	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) serves as a microcosm of evolutionary dynamics. SNPs, the most common type of genetic variation among individuals, can subtly alter protein structure or function, impacting traits and susceptibility to diseases. These genetic markers are crucial in genetic mapping, phylogenetic studies, and personalized medicine, offering insights into an individual's predisposition to certain conditions. SNPs can also shed light on population history, as they reflect migration patterns and admixture events. Despite their seemingly minor role, these tiny genetic differences carry significant implications for understanding both human diversity and disease etiology.
D1-600	In this work, wild-type and heterozygous \b{eta}-thalassaemic mice were enriched with 57Fe through gastrointestinal absorption to characterize in more details the iron complexes appeared in the measured Mossbauer spectra. The 57Fe enrichment method was validated and Mossbauer spectra were obtained at 80K from blood samples from wild-type and \b{eta}-thalassaemic mice at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months of age. As expected, the haemoglobin levels of the thalassaemic mice were lower than from normal mice indicating anaemia. Furthermore, significant amounts of ferritin-like iron were observed in the thalassaemic mice samples, which decreased with mouse age, reflecting the pattern of reticulocyte count reduction reported in the literature.
D1-601	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of probiotics has gained significant attention. Probiotics, live microorganisms, primarily bacteria, offer numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. They populate our gut, aiding digestion and bolstering our immune system. These friendly bacteria compete with harmful ones, preventing infections and promoting a balanced microflora. Furthermore, they synthesize essential vitamins, particularly B and K, and assist in nutrient absorption to ensure optimal health. The integration of probiotics in food and supplements is a promising approach to promote gut health and combat various gastrointestinal ailments.
D1-602	The circadian clock is the molecular mechanism responsible for the adaptation to daily rhythms in living organisms. Oscillations and fluctuations in environmental conditions regulate the circadian clock through signaling pathways. We study the response to continuous photic perturbations in a minimal molecular network model of the circadian clock, composed of 5 nonlinear delay differential equations with multiple feedbacks. We model the perturbation as a stationary stochastic process, and we consider the resulting irreversibility of trajectories as a key effect of the interaction. In particular we adopt a measure of mutual mapping irreversibility in the time series thermodynamics framework, and we find 12 hours harmonics.
D1-603	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged, offering a new perspective on gene expression. Epigenetics refers to modifications that alter the structure of DNA without changing its sequence. These modifications can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle, and they play a crucial role in gene expression and cellular function. For instance, the epigenetic mark methylation can silence genes, while histone modifications can activate them. This dynamic process allows cells to respond to external stimuli and adapt to changing conditions, contributing to the complexity and plasticity of life. Epigenetics offers a promising avenue for the study of disease, aging, and evolution, as it bridges the gap between genes and their phenotypic effects.
D1-604	Most known proteins in nature consist of multiple domains. Interactions between domains may lead to unexpected folding and misfolding phenomena. This study of human {\gamma}D-crystallin, a two-domain protein in the eye lens, revealed one such surprise: conformational catalysis of misfolding via intermolecular domain interface ''stealing''. An intermolecular interface between the more stable domains outcompetes the native intramolecular domain interface. Loss of the native interface in turn promotes misfolding and subsequent aggregation, especially in cataract-related {\gamma}D-crystallin variants. This phenomenon is likely a contributing factor in the development of cataract disease, the leading worldwide cause of blindness. However, interface stealing likely occurs in many proteins composed of two or more interacting domains.
D1-605	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the 'powerhouses' of cells, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells, through a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria's double membrane structure, unique among cell organelles, accentuates their significance. Their dynamism is equally remarkable, with constant division and fusion events ensuring a delicate balance in cellular energy production. Mitochondrial DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA, encodes essential proteins required for the organelle's function. Dysfunction in mitochondria has been implicated in various diseases, a testament to their indispensable role in maintaining life at the cellular level.
D1-606	Using a Multi-agent systems paradigm, the present project develops, validates and exploits a computational $\textit{testbed}$ that simulates micro-biological complex systems, namely the aggregation patterns of the social amoeba $\textit{Dyctiostelium discoideum}$. We propose a new design and implementation for managing discrete simulations with autonomous agents on a microscopic scale, thus focusing on their social behavior and mutual interactions. Then, the dependence on the main physical variables is tested, namely density and number of amoebas. in addition, we analyze the robustness of the dynamics against various noise sources. Along with these results, we suggest a methodology for further studies that make use of our validated model.
D1-607	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code, a sequence of nucleotides within DNA or RNA, is deciphered by the ribosome, a complex organelle, to synthesize proteins. This process, transcription and translation, is the fundamental pathway through which genetic information is transformed into the building blocks of life. The genetic code, universal across species, is a testament to the intricate and unified machinery of life, indicating a common ancestry and shared evolutionary history. This code's efficiency and robustness, despite billions of years of evolution, underscores the beauty and complexity of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-608	In our article we present a computational model for the simulation of self-propelled anisotropic bacteria. To this end we use a self-propelled particle model and augment it with a statistical algorithm for the run-and-tumble motion. We derive an equation for the distribution of reorientations of the bacteria that we use to analyze the statistics of the random walk and that allows us to tune the behavior of our model to the characteristics of an E.coli bacterium. We validate our implementation in terms of a single swimmer and demonstrate that our model is capable of reproducing E.coli's run-and-tumble motion with excellent accuracy.
D1-609	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a captivating example of biological cooperation. This phenomenon, where two different species live in close proximity, often interdependent, weaves a bond that benefits both parties. Consider the relationship between clownfish and sea anemones. The clownfish, with its vibrant colors, finds safety amidst the anemone's stinging tentacles, while the anemone, in turn, benefits from the fish's waste, which provides valuable nutrients. This mutualistic relationship, a testament to the complexity and interconnectedness of life, underscores the beauty of evolution and adaptation in the animal kingdom.
D1-610	We derive a reduction formula for singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations (in the sense of Tikhonov and Fenichel) with a known parameterization of the critical manifold. No a priori assumptions concerning separation of slow and fast variables are made, or necessary.We apply the theoretical results to chemical reaction networks with mass action kinetics admitting slow and fast reactions. For some relevant classes of such systems there exist canonical parameterizations of the variety of stationary points, hence the theory is applicable in a natural manner. In particular we obtain a closed form expression for the reduced system when the fast subsystem admits complex balanced steady states.
D1-611	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis serves as the vital link between the sun's energy and the earth's ecosystem. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only fuels plant growth but also sustains all life on Earth by providing oxygen and a primary food source.

This underlines the vital significance of photosynthesis in the delicate balance of our biosphere.
D1-612	Small-world structures are often used to describe structural connections in the brain. In this work, we compare the structural connection of cortical areas of a healthy brain and a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease with artificial small-world networks. Based on statistics analysis, we demonstrate that similar small-world networks can be constructed using Newman-Watts procedure. The network quantifiers of both structural matrices are identified inside the probabilistic valley. Despite of similarities between structural connection matrices and sampled small-world networks, increased assortativity can be found in the Alzheimer brain. Our results indicate that network quantifiers can be helpful to identify abnormalities in real structural connection matrices.

This enigmatic cephalopod, native to the Indo-Pacific region, illuminates its body with a series of flashes, creating an ethereal dance of light. The squid's bioluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction in specialized light-producing organs, known as photophores. These reactions involve luciferin, a light-emitting molecule, and the enzyme luciferase.

D1-614	The discovery of genomic polymorphisms influencing gene expression (also known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) can be formulated as a sparse Bayesian multivariate/multiple regression problem. An important aspect in the development of such models is the implementation of bespoke inference methodologies, a process which can become quite laborious, when multiple candidate models are being considered. We describe automatic, black-box inference in such models using Stan, a popular probabilistic programming language. The utilisation of systems like Stan can facilitate model prototyping and testing, thus accelerating the data modelling process. The code described in this chapter can be found at https://github.com/dvav/eQTLBookChapter.
D1-615	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single mutation can have profound effects. For instance, the mutation of a gene known as Myostatin, found in the Belgian Blue cattle, leads to a dramatic increase in muscle mass. This is due to the inhibition of Myostatin's normal function, which typically regulates muscle growth. Consequently, these cattle exhibit a phenotype characterized by extensive muscle development, giving them a distinct 'double-muscled' appearance. Similarly, in humans, a mutation of the same gene can result in a condition called 'fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy', characterized by progressive muscle wasting, particularly in the shoulder and upper arm areas. This exemplifies how minor genetic alterations can significantly impact an organism's physical characteristics and health.

Understanding the microvasculature is vital in tackling fundamental research questions as well as to understand effects of disease progression on the physiological wellbeing of an individual. We have previously provided a wide ranging review [38] covering most of the available techniques and their applications. In this review, we discuss the recent advances made and applications in the field of microcirculation imaging.

This is realized by investigating the behavior of the average crossing number, the mean writhe, and the minimal crossing number of photons' paths generated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, for different sets of optical parameters. It is observed that the complexity of the photons' paths increases for increasing light source/detector spacing, and that highly ""knotted"" paths are formed. Due to the particular rules utilized to generate the MC photons' paths, the present results may have an interest not only for the biomedical optics community, but also from a pure mathematical point of view."

In analogy with the self-propelled disk, the polarity memory effect of eukaryotic cell is a fundamental candidate for this alignment mechanism. In the present paper, we theoretically examine the polarity memory effect for the motion alignment of cells on the basis of the cellular Potts model. We show that the polarity memory effect can align motion of cells. We also find that the polarity memory effect emerges for the persistent length of cell trajectories longer than average cell-cell distance.

However, as with any powerful tool, ethical considerations arise, such as the potential misuse in creating 'designer babies' or altering the fundamental nature of organisms. Therefore, the responsible and judicious use of CRISPR-Cas9 is crucial, ensuring its benefits outweigh any potential risks.
D1-626	"We consider certain analytical features of a stochastic model that can explain among other things competition among species and simultaneous predation on the competing species from a geometric perspective which allows for a systematic description of models admitting singular Lagrangians. The model equations are shown to admit a Jacobi Last Multiplier which in turn allows for the construction of a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is of singular nature so that construction of the Hamiltonian via a Legendre transformation is not possible. A Hamiltonian description of the model therefore requires the introduction of Dirac brackets. Explicit results are presented for the ""Kill the winner"" model and its reductions."
D1-627	 In the realm of microbiology, the intricate dance between bacteria and their hosts extends to the human gut, a veritable metropolis teeming with microbial life. These gut microbes, a diverse array of species, play pivotal roles in digestion, nutrient absorption, and even mental health. A healthy gut microbiome, a balanced ecosystem of these microbes, is crucial for overall well-being. An imbalance, or dysbiosis, can lead to a multitude of health issues, ranging from gastrointestinal disorders to autoimmune diseases. Understanding and nurturing this delicate symbiosis is key to maintaining health and fostering resilience against disease.
D1-628	Motivated by biological membrane-containing organelles in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, we study charge regulation in a model membrane stack. Considering (de)protonation as the simplest mechanism of charge equilibration between the membranes and with the bathing environment, we uncover a symmetry-broken charge state in the stack with a quasiperiodic effective charge sequence. In the case of a monovalent bathing salt solution our model predicts complex, inhomogeneous charge equilibria depending on the strength of the (de)protonation reaction, salt concentration, intermembrane separation, and their number in the stack. Our results shed light on the basic reorganization mechanism of thylakoid membrane stacks.

These tiny architects, with their intricate wax structures, are vital pollinators, responsible for the reproduction of approximately 30% of our food crops. Their impact extends beyond agriculture, as they contribute to the diversity and health of ecosystems. Each bee, on its daily foraging journey, collects pollen from flowers, facilitating cross-pollination. This process ensures genetic diversity among plant species, which is crucial for optimum growth and resilience. Simultaneously, bees gather nectar to nourish their hive, thereby playing a pivotal role in the conservation of biodiversity. The complex interplay of these tiny creatures with nature underscores the delicate balance within our ecosystems.
D1-630	In our Brief Communication (DOI: 10.1038/s41592-018-0033-z), we presented the method SAVER for recovering true gene expression levels in noisy single cell RNA sequencing data. We evaluated the performance of SAVER, along with comparable methods MAGIC and scImpute, in an RNA FISH validation experiment and a data downsampling experiment. In a Comment [arXiv:1908.07084v1], Li & Li were concerned with the use of the downsampled datasets, specifically focusing on clustering results obtained from the Zeisel et al. data. Here, we will address these comments and, furthermore, amend the data downsampling experiment to demonstrate that the findings from the data downsampling experiment in our Brief Communication are valid.

Such advancements pave the way for novel therapies, including the eradication of genetic diseases, the enhancement of crop yield, and the development of disease-resistant organisms. However, the consequences of widespread gene editing remain a subject of ethical debate, as society grapples with questions surrounding human evolution, biodiversity, and the potential for genetic inequality. Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of CRISPR-Cas9 in the field of biology are undeniably transformative, offering a new frontier in our understanding and manipulation of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-632	Molecular dynamics (MD) has become a powerful tool for studying biophysical systems, due to increasing computational power and availability of software. Although MD has made many contributions to better understanding these complex biophysical systems, there remain methodological difficulties to be surmounted. First, how to make the deluge of data generated in running even a microsecond long MD simulation human comprehensible.

These are viruses that infect bacteria, offering a promising avenue for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Phages are highly specific, targeting only certain bacterial species, minimizing collateral damage. Through a process known as bacteriophage therapy, these viruses can infect and destroy the harmful bacteria, potentially revolutionizing the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. Moreover, the rapid adaptation of phages to changing bacterial landscapes suggests a dynamic and versatile tool in the ongoing battle against microbial threats.
D1-634	This work is devoted to the establishment of a Poisson structure for a format of equations known as Generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. These equations, which include the classical Lotka-Volterra systems as a particular case, have been deeply studied in the literature. They have been shown to constitute a whole hierarchy of systems, the characterization of which is made in the context of simple algebra. Our main result is to show that this algebraic structure is completely translatable into the Poisson domain. Important Poisson structures features, such as the symplectic foliation and the Darboux' canonical representation, arise as result of rather simple matrix manipulations.
D1-635	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a crucial player.

We review the status of rapid evolution and also enumerate the current and future challenges of achieving a full understanding of rapid evolution in all its manifestations.
D1-639	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics, a layer above the traditional DNA sequence, regulates gene expression without altering the actual DNA sequence. It does this through various mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification, effectively controlling the 'on' and 'off' switches of genes. This intricate dance of chemical tags on DNA and its associated proteins determines our cellular traits and responses, playing a crucial role in processes like development, aging, and disease susceptibility. The study of epigenetics promises a deeper understanding of heredity and its interplay with environment, potentially opening new avenues for disease prevention and treatment strategies.

D1-642	We used machine learning methods to predict NaV1.7 inhibitors and found the model RF-CDK that performed best on the imbalanced dataset. Using the RF-CDK model for screening drugs, we got effective compounds K1. We use the cell patch clamp method to verify K1. However, because the model evaluation method in this article is not comprehensive enough, there is still a lot of research work to be performed, such as comparison with other existing methods.   The target protein has multiple active sites and requires our further research. We need more detailed models to consider this biological process and compare it with the current results, which is an error in this article.   So we want to withdraw this article.

This natural light show is orchestrated by various deep-sea organisms, from the tiny dinoflagellate to the colossal giant squid. Bioluminescence serves multiple purposes, such as communication, camouflage, and luring prey. Luciferin and luciferase, enzyme-substrate pairs, catalyze the light-emitting chemical reaction. The intensity and color of the light emitted can vary, influenced by the specific organism and the conditions within its environment. These mesmerizing light displays not only enchant scientists but also offer valuable insights into the adaptations and behaviors of life under the sea.
D1-644	The genetic composition of a naturally developing population is considered as due to mutation, selection, genetic drift and recombination. Selection is modeled as single-locus terms (additive fitness) and two-loci terms (pairwise epistatic fitness). The problem is posed to infer epistatic fitness from population-wide whole-genome data from a time series of a developing population. We generate such data in silico, and show that in the Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) phase of Kimura, Neher and Shraiman, that pertains at high enough recombination rates and low enough mutation rates, epistatic fitness can be quantitatively correctly inferred using inverse Ising/Potts methods.

D1-648	"How much information is transmitted when animals use emotions to communicate? It is clear that emotions are used as communication systems in humans and other species. The quantitative theory of emotion information presented here is based on Shannon's mathematical theory of information in communication systems. The theory explains myriad aspects of emotion communication and offers dozens of new directions for research. It is superior to the ""contagion"" theory of emotion spreading, which is currently dominant. One important application of the information theory of emotion communication is that it permits the development of emotion security systems for social networks to guard against the widespread emotion manipulation we see online today."

D1-650	The cell cycle duration is a variable cellular phenotype that underlies long-term population growth and age structures. By analyzing the stationary solutions of a branching process with heritable cell division times, we demonstrate existence of a phase transition, which can be continuous or first-order, by which a non-zero fraction of the population becomes localized at a minimal division time. Just below the transition, we demonstrate coexistence of localized and delocalized age-structure phases, and power law decay of correlation functions. Above it, we observe self-synchronization of cell cycles, collective divisions, and slow 'aging' of population growth rates.

Efforts to conserve these critical habitats, through policy changes, conservation programs, and individual actions, are crucial to safeguard the planet's biodiversity and maintain the health of our oceans.
D1-652	Using a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) meta-population model of disease transmission, we present analytical calculations and numerical simulations dissecting the interplay between stochasticity and the division of a population into mutually independent sub-populations. We show that subdivision activates two stochastic effects---extinction and desynchronization---diminishing the overall impact of the outbreak, even when the total population has already left the stochastic regime and the basic reproduction number is not altered by the subdivision. Both effects are quantitatively captured by our theoretical estimates, allowing us to determine their individual contributions to the observed reduction of the peak of the epidemic.

D1-654	Heterologous gene expression draws resources from host cells. These resources include vital components to sustain growth and replication, and the resulting cellular burden is a widely recognised bottleneck in the design of robust circuits. In this tutorial we discuss the use of computational models that integrate gene circuits and the physiology of host cells. Through various use cases, we illustrate the power of host-circuit models to predict the impact of design parameters on both burden and circuit functionality.

We analyze the projected spread of COVID-19 in Louisiana without including the effects of the stay-at-home order. We predict that a large fraction of the state population would be infected without the mitigation efforts, and would certainly overwhelm the capacity of Louisiana health care system. We further predict the outcomes with different degrees of reduction in the infection rate. More than 70% of reduction is required to cap the number of infected to under one million.
D1-657	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between DNA and environmental influences.

Balancing progress with responsibility is crucial, ensuring that this powerful technology serves humanity's best interests while minimizing potential risks and abuses.
D1-660	The lyric career of Maria Callas, though exceptional, is also noteworthy for its brevity. The first signs of downturn appeared at the age of 36 and her voice fell silent at only 40. Though the literature has massively commented on this premature worsening, few analyses of its characteristics have been made public so far. The purpose of our study was to realise a perceptual and acoustical analysis of recorded arias by the artist at the climax to the fall. The audible impairments were first verbally described, and then compared to acoustical observations based on spectrographic analyses and fundamental-frequency measurements.
D1-661	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating concept is the epigenetic modification. Unlike DNA sequence alterations, epigenetic changes do not affect the genetic code itself, but rather influence gene expression. These modifications, often triggered by environmental factors, can switch genes on or off, hence controlling diverse biological processes such as cell differentiation and development. Epigenetics thus serves as a bridge between nature and nurture, offering a complex and dynamic perspective on how our genes respond to the world around us, shaping our health and behavior.
D1-662	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Understanding the underlying gene mutations in HCC provides great prognostic value for treatment planning and targeted therapy. Radiogenomics has revealed an association between non-invasive imaging features and molecular genomics. However, imaging feature identification is laborious and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for mutation prediction in APOB, COL11A1 and ATRX genes using multiphasic CT scans. Considering intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) in HCC, multi-region sampling technology is implemented to generate the dataset for experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Optimization using genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal solutions. Our results suggest the best-case strategy for Sao Paulo is to maintain or increase the current magnitude of social distancing for at least 60 more days and increase the current levels of personal protection behaviors by a minimum of 10% (e.g., wearing facemasks, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration). Followed by a long-term oscillatory level of social distancing with a stepping-down approach every 80 days over a period of two years with continued protective behavior.
D1-665	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis stands as a captivating process, the lifeblood of Earth's green biomass. This intricate dance of energy and carbon occurs within plant cells, harnessing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen.

D1-666	The actin cortex is a thin layer of actin, myosin, and actin binding proteins that underlies the membrane of most animal cells. It is highly dynamic and can undergo remodelling on time-scales of tens of seconds thanks to protein turnover and myosin-mediated contractions. The cortex enables cells to resist external mechanical stresses, controls cell shape, and allows cells to exert forces on their neighbours. Thus, its mechanical properties are key to its physiological function. Here, we give an overview of how cortex composition, structure, and dynamics control cortex mechanics and cell shape. We use mitosis as an example to illustrate how global and local regulation of cortex mechanics give rise to a complex series of cell shape changes.

We evaluate the effect of control interventions implemented till now and estimate the case numbers for infections and deaths averted by these restrictive measures. We further provide a forecast on the extent of the future Covid-19 transmission in India and predict the probable numbers of infections and fatalities under various potential scenarios.

However, in open chemical reaction networks such as metabolic pathways, this approach can lead to significant kinetic and thermodynamic inconsistencies. Based on recent developments in nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics, we present a validity criterion solely expressed in terms of the equilibrium constant of the enzyme-catalysed reaction. When satisfied, it guarantees the ability of the irreversible MM equation to generate kinetic and thermodynamic data that are quantitatively reliable for reasonable ranges of concentrations. Our validity criterion is thus a precious tool to ensure reliable kinetic and thermodynamic modelling of pathways. We also show that it correctly identifies the so-called irreversible enzymatic reactions in glycolysis and Krebs cycle.

D1-682	The size of a probe bead reported by holographic particle characterization depends on the proportion of the surface area covered by bound target molecules and so can be used as an assay for molecular binding. We validate this technique by measuring the kinetics of irreversible binding for the antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) as they attach to micrometer-diameter colloidal beads coated with protein A. These measurements yield the antibodies' binding rates and can be inverted to obtain the concentration of antibodies in solution. Holographic molecular binding assays therefore can be used to perform fast quantitative immunoassays that are complementary to conventional serological tests.

We find that a safe reopening requires strong policy from administrators combined with cautious behavior from students. Strong policy includes weekly screening tests with quick turnaround and halving the campus population. Cautious behavior from students means wearing facemasks, socializing less, and showing up for COVID-19 testing. We also find that comprehensive testing and facemasks are the most effective single interventions, building closures can lead to infection spikes in other areas depending on student behavior, and faster return of test results significantly reduces total infections.

We assembled the largest repository of expert-curated Boolean GRN models. A meta-analysis of this diverse set of models reveals several design principles. GRNs exhibit more canalization, redundancy and stable dynamics than expected. Moreover, they are enriched for certain recurring network motifs. This raises the important question why evolution favors these design mechanisms.

Here, we model the risk of in-room airborne disease transmission via expiratory particle emission versus the average loudness of vocalization and for variable room ventilation rates. The model indicates that a 6-decibel reduction in average vocalization intensity yields a reduction in aerosol transmission probability equivalent to doubling the room ventilation rate. The results suggest that public health authorities should consider implementing ""quiet zones"" in high-risk indoor environments, such as hospital waiting rooms or dining facilities, to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne respiratory diseases."
D1-693	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can have profound effects. These tiny variations in DNA sequence, occurring often in non-coding regions, can subtly alter gene expression or function, influencing traits and diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, while another in the BRCA1 gene heightens susceptibility to breast cancer. These insights into our genetic makeup open doors for personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to an individual's unique genetic profile, ultimately improving health outcomes. Yet, the complexity of these interactions means that the story of our genes is far from fully decoded.
D1-694	Protein conformational fluctuations are highly complex and exhibit long-term correlations. Here, molecular dynamics simulations of small proteins demonstrate that these conformational fluctuations directly affect the protein's instantaneous diffusivity $D_I$. We find that the radius of gyration $R_g$ of the proteins exhibits $1/f$ fluctuations, that are synchronous with the fluctuations of $D_I$. Our analysis demonstrates the validity of the local Stokes-Einstein type relation $D_I\propto1/(R_g + R_0)$, where $R_0\sim0.3$ nm is assumed to be a hydration layer around the protein. From the analysis of different protein types with both strong and weak conformational fluctuations the validity of the Stokes-Einstein type relation appears to be a general property.

D1-698	Exploiting the SIQR model for COVID-19, I show that the wavy infection curve in Japan is the result of fluctuation of policy on isolation measure imposed by the government and obeyed by citizens. Assuming the infection coefficient be a two-valued function of the number of daily confirmed new cases, I show that when the removal rate of infected individuals is between these two values, the wavy infection curve is self-organized. On the basis of the infection curve, I classify the outbreak of COVID-19 into five types and show that these differences can be related to the relative magnitude of the transmission coefficient and the quarantine rate of infected individuals.

D1-700	Aggregating transcriptomics data across hospitals can increase sensitivity and robustness of differential expression analyses, yielding deeper clinical insights. As data exchange is often restricted by privacy legislation, meta-analyses are frequently employed to pool local results. However, if class labels are inhomogeneously distributed between cohorts, their accuracy may drop. Flimma (https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/flimma/) addresses this issue by implementing the state-of-the-art workflow limma voom in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e. patient data never leaves its source site. Flimma results are identical to those generated by limma voom on combined datasets even in imbalanced scenarios where meta-analysis approaches fail.

This innovative tool, derived from bacterial defense mechanisms, allows precise editing of genomes. By introducing customizable cuts and repairs, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce beneficial traits, or even eradicate harmful pathogens. This technology holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even addressing environmental concerns. However, ethical considerations surrounding its use in altering human heredity remain a contentious issue. As research advances, striking a balance between scientific progress and moral responsibility becomes increasingly crucial.
D1-702	Genetic information and environmental factors determine the path of an individuals life and therefore, the evolution of its entire species. We have succeeded in proposing and studying a model that captures this idea. In our model, a renewable resource extended throughout the environment provides the energy necessary to sustain life, including movement and reproduction. Since the resource doesn't regrow immediately, it generates competition between individuals and therefore provides a natural selection pressure from which evolution of the genetic traits is observed. As a result of this, several phenomena characteristic of living systems emerge from this model without having to introduce them explicitly. These include speciation and punctuated equilibrium, competitive exclusion, and altruistic behaviour from selfish rules.
D1-703	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential process in nitrogen cycling, is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria within root nodules of leguminous plants. These bacteria, such as Rhizobia, convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, thereby enriching soil fertility. This mutualistic relationship is crucial for the survival of both organisms, as plants provide the bacteria with carbohydrates, while the bacteria provide the plants with essential nitrogen compounds. This process significantly contributes to the sustainability of agricultural systems, reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers and minimizing environmental pollution.
D1-704	A formal analogy of fluctuating diffusivity to thermodynamics is discussed for messenger RNA molecules fluorescently fused to a protein in living cells. Regarding the average value of the fluctuating diffusivity of such RNA-protein particles as the analog of the internal energy, the analogs of the quantity of heat and work are identified. The Clausius-like inequality is shown to hold for the entropy associated with diffusivity fluctuations, which plays a role analogous to the thermodynamic entropy, and the analog of the quantity of heat. The change of the statistical fluctuation distribution is also examined from a geometric perspective. The present discussions may contribute to a deeper understanding of the fluctuating diffusivity in view of the laws of thermodynamics.

Upon binding to their respective ligands, GPCRs undergo a conformation change, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that ultimately modify cell behavior. This versatility allows GPCRs to regulate diverse cellular processes, from vision and smell to immune response and behavior, making them essential for life and a primary target for drug discovery.
D1-706	In physics of living systems, a search for relationships of a few macroscopic variables that emerge from many microscopic elements is a central issue. We evolved gene regulatory networks so that the expression of target genes (partial system) is insensitive to environmental changes. Then, we found the expression levels of the remaining genes autonomously increase as a plastic response. Negative proportionality was observed between the average changes in target and remnant genes, reflecting reciprocity between the macroscopic robustness of homeostatic genes and plasticity of regulator genes. This reciprocity follows the lever principle, which was satisfied throughout the evolutionary course, imposing an evolutionary constraint.
D1-707	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a captivating process, ensuring the faithful duplication of genetic information during cell division. This intricate dance commences with the unwinding of the double helix, facilitated by helicases, followed by the action of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, which synthesizes new strands of DNA using the original template. Nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, are linked together in a specific order dictated by primers and the base-pairing rules. Proofreading enzymes then ensure the accuracy of the newly synthesized DNA, maintaining the genetic integrity of the organism. This awe-inspiring process, a testament to nature's intricate design, has been instrumental in our understanding of life's fundamental mechanisms.
D1-708	Deterministic compartmental models have been used extensively in modeling epidemic propagation. These models are required to fit available data and numerical procedures are often implemented to this end. But not every model architecture is able to fit the data because the structure of the model imposes hard constraints on the solutions. We investigate in this work two such situations: first the distribution of transition times from a compartment to another may impose a variable number of intermediary states. secondly, a non-linear relationship between time-dependent measures of compartments sizes may indicate the need for structurations (i.e., considering several groups of individuals of heterogeneous characteristics).
D1-709	 In marine ecosystems, the Great Barrier Reef stands as a remarkable biodiversity hotspot, teeming with life. Its coral species, some of which are millions of years old, provide habitats for thousands of marine organisms. From the tiniest plankton to the largest whales, each creature plays a crucial role in maintaining this delicate balance. The reef's health is now under threat due to climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Coral bleaching events, caused by warmer ocean temperatures, have led to massive coral deaths, causing ripples throughout the ecosystem. Urgent action is needed to protect this living wonder, ensuring its survival for generations to come. Every effort counts in preserving the Great Barrier Reef's rich tapestry of life.

These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring frequently across the human genome, can subtly alter gene function and, in turn, phenotypic traits. For instance, the APOE4 SNP, found in the APOE gene, is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, the CCR5-Δ32 mutation, affecting the CCR5 gene, offers protective immunity against HIV infection in some individuals. These SNPs underscore the intricate dance between our genetic makeup and various diseases, highlighting the potential for precision medicine in the future.

These evolutionary mechanisms complicate our attempts to use modern nanoscale science to develop effective and efficient treatments for disease or other biological dysfunctions. Here we describe the complexity of biology on the nanoscale and the implications for the success of recently-discovered nanoscience, which has resulted in an almost infinite number of potential nanomaterials of unknown efficacy. We discuss how tools to categorize nanomaterials on the basis of structure, properties and interactions can provide insights on promising directions.
D1-713	 In marine ecosystems, the kelp forest sustains an extraordinary biodiversity, serving as a vital nursery and shelter for numerous species. Giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense underwater canopies, offering protection and food sources to myriad organisms. Seals, otters, and various fish species find refuge amongst the kelp fronds, while the forest floor provides a habitat for invertebrates like sea urchins and snails. Moreover, the kelp forest plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and contributing to the mitigation of climate change. As these underwater forests face threats from overfishing, pollution, and climate change, their conservation is essential to preserving marine biodiversity and ensuring the health of our oceans.
D1-714	As 2021 dawns, the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging strongly as vaccines finally appear and hopes for a return to normalcy start to materialize. There is much to be learned from the pandemic's first year data that will likely remain applicable to future epidemics and possible pandemics. With only minor variants in virus strain, countries across the globe have suffered roughly the same pandemic by first glance, yet few locations exhibit the same patterns of viral spread, growth, and control as the state of Hawai'i. In this paper, we examine the data and compare the COVID-19 spread statistics between the counties of Hawai'i as well as examine several locations with similar properties to Hawai'i.
D1-715	 In the realm of genetic diversity, the humble honeybee stands as a fascinating example. Its genome, a complex tapestry of DNA, reveals a unique social structure that has evolved over millennia. A single colony houses thousands of individuals, each with a slightly different genetic makeup, a consequence of the process known as gene flow. This genetic variance is crucial for the survival of the colony, as it fosters resilience against diseases and adaptability to environmental changes. Furthermore, the presence of both males (drones) and females (workers and queens) within a colony introduces sexual reproduction, ensuring a continuous evolutionary cycle. This intricate interplay of genetics, social structure, and environmental pressures underpins the remarkable success of the honeybee in our ecosystem.
D1-716	Over the last ten years, developments in whole-brain microscopy now allow for high-resolution imaging of intact brains of small rodents such as mice. These complex images contain a wealth of information, but many neuroscience laboratories do not have all of the computational knowledge and tools needed to process these data. We review recent open source tools for registration of images to atlases, and the segmentation, visualisation and analysis of brain regions and labelled structures such as neurons. Since the field lacks fully integrated analysis pipelines for all types of whole-brain microscopy analysis, we propose a pathway for tool developers to work together to meet this challenge.
D1-717	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. It takes place in chloroplasts, specialized organelles within plant cells. Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere, while carbon dioxide from the air is fixed to create glucose. This process not only sustains the organisms performing it, but also significantly contributes to our planet's oxygen supply and carbon cycle, making it a vital element in maintaining Earth's ecosystems.
D1-718	We demonstrate a method to double the collection efficiency in Laser Tweezers Raman Spectroscopy (LTRS) by collecting both the forward and back-scattered light in a single-shot multitrack measurement. Our method can collect signals at different sample volumes, granting both the pinpoint spatial selectivity of confocal Raman and the bulk sensitivity of non-confocal Raman simultaneously. Further, we display that our approach allows for reduced detector integration time and laser power. Thus, our method will enable the monitoring of biological samples sensitive to high intensities for longer times. Additionally, we demonstrate that by a simple modification, we can add polarization sensitivity and retrieve extra biochemical information.
D1-719	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet. Green leaves, the silent choreographers, absorb carbon dioxide and water, transforming them into glucose and oxygen through the magic of sunlight. This process, the lifeblood of Earth's ecosystems, sustains not just plants, but every organism on our blue planet. It is a symphony of science and art, a testament to nature's infinite creativity and complexity. Photosynthesis, in its essence, is the very essence of life, a continuous, harmonious performance that has graced our world for billions of years.
D1-720	Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is currently of great interest in cell biology. LLPS is an example of what is called an emergent phenomenon -- an idea that comes from condensed-matter physics. Emergent phenomena have the characteristic feature of having a switch-like response. I show that the Hill equation of biochemistry can be used as a simple model of strongly cooperative, switch-like, behaviour. One result is that a switch-like response requires relatively few molecules, even ten gives a strongly switch-like response. Thus if a biological function enabled by LLPS relies on LLPS to provide a switch-like response to a stimulus, then condensates large enough to be visible in optical microscopy are not needed.
D1-721	 In the realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the 'powerhouses' of cells, play a crucial role in energy production.

Understanding proteins and their dynamic behavior is crucial for advancing our knowledge of biology and potentially engineering solutions to health challenges.
D1-836	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important membrane protein in vertebrates. The function of CFTR is to transport chloride ions across the cell membrane, which is known to require adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas most conventional wisdom suggests that ATP interacts with CFTR purely through random collisions via diffusion, we investigate electrostatic interactions between CFTR and ATP at the mesoscale (10s of Angstroms). We use molecular dynamics to simulate CFTR-ATP interactions in cases where CFTR is bound/unbound from ATP, and we demonstrate an electrostatic potential gradient towards CFTR when ATP is unbound. We additionally compute electrostatic interactions between ATP and the solvent and membrane, which are simulated explicitly.

Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.

In this study, anterior STEMI patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and then imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance 1-2 days later. The cine images were analyzed with computational feature-tracking algorithms to assess end-systolic circumferential (ESC) strain. It was found that contractile function is not only depressed in the infarct and border zone regions, but also in the remote myocardium. This is contrary to other types of infarctions where remote myocardium shows enhanced compensatory function. Quantifying ESC could help identify high risk patients.

To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.

This metabolic pathway transforms biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. The process unfolds in three stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain. Glycolysis, which occurs within the cytoplasm, breaks down glucose into pyruvate, yielding ATP and NADH. The citric acid cycle, situated in the mitochondrial matrix, further breaks down pyruvate, generating additional ATP, NADH, and FADH2. Lastly, the electron transport chain, also in the mitochondria, harnesses the energy from NADH and FADH2 to produce more ATP via chemiosmosis, powering the cell's operations. In essence, cellular respiration is the engine that keeps life ticking.

The non-equilibrium dynamics shows several regimes: irreversible adsorption on short time scales, an intermediate plateau followed by a power-law regime and finally exponential relaxation towards equilibrium. In all four regimes we give analytical solutions. The algebraic decay and the scaling behaviour can be explained by mapping onto a simple reaction-diffusion model.

D1-872	We present a theory for the laboratory and epidemiological data for incubation times in infectious prion diseases. The central feature of our model is that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds controls the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and subsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a general framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the striking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated into lab animals.

Details of the one-variable (RM$_1$) implementation of this algorithm are presented. This is followed by an extension to simultaneous updating of two dynamical variables (RM$_2$). In a test with Met-Enkephalin in vacuum RM$_2$ improves conventional Metropolis simulations by a factor of about four. Correlations between three or more dihedral angles appear to prevent larger improvements at low temperatures. We also investigate a multi-hit Metropolis scheme, which spends more CPU time on variables with large autocorrelation times.

Green plants, algae, and some bacteria harness solar energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This biological marvel, taking place in chloroplasts, fuels the Earth's living organisms, forming the basis of nearly all food chains. Similarly, respiration, occurring in the cells of all living things, breaks down glucose to produce energy, releasing carbon dioxide and water, thus rejoining the cycle of life. These fundamental processes underscore the interconnectedness of life on our planet, a testament to nature's enduring balance and harmony.
D1-888	"CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk) is a model of protein folding that combines SAW (self-avoiding walk) with Monte-Carlo. It simulates the Brownian motion of a chain molecule in the presence of interactions, both among chain residues, and with the environment. In a first model that includes the hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding, a chain of 30 residues folds into a native state with stable secondary and tertiary structures. The process starts with a rapid collapse into an intermediate ""molten globule"", which slowly decays into the native state afer a relatively long quiescent period. The behavior of the radius of gyration mimics experimental data."
D1-889	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the tantalizing intrigue of DNA, the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule, composed of nucleotides, holds the key to heredity. Each nucleotide, a combination of phosphate, sugar, and a nitrogenous base, serves as a rung in the molecular ladder, encoding the genetic instructions for every living organism. The sequence of these bases, Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C), forms the genetic code, subtly dictating the development, growth, and function of cells. Alterations in this code, known as mutations, can lead to genetic disorders, highlighting the delicate balance that governs life at its most fundamental level.
D1-890	Dielectrophoretic trapping of six different DNA fragments, sizes varying from the 27 to 8416 bp, has been studied using confocal microscopy. The effect of the DNA length and the size of the constriction between nanoscale fingertip electrodes on the trapping efficiency have been investigated. Using finite element method simulations in conjunction with the analysis of the experimental data, the polarizabilities of the different size DNA fragments have been calculated for different frequencies. Also the immobilization of trapped hexanethiol- and DTPA-modified 140 nm long DNA to the end of gold nanoelectrodes was experimentally quantified and the observations were supported by density functional theory calculations.
D1-891	 Nitrogen, an essential element for life, constitutes a significant portion of our atmosphere but exists in a form unavailable for most organisms. Enter nitrogen-fixing bacteria, resilient microbes that convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, nitrate or ammonia. These bacteria form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, such as legumes, in a process called nitrogen fixation. This mutualistic alliance bolsters plant growth while providing bacteria with essential carbohydrates. In addition to their role in agriculture, these bacteria play a crucial part in global nitrogen cycling, ensuring the availability of nitrogen for countless organisms, including us. This remarkable biological process underpins the productivity of our ecosystems, highlighting the intricate interplay between microbes, plants, and the environment.
D1-892	A simple analytical framework to study the molecular quasispecies evolution of finite populations is proposed, in which the population is assumed to be a random combination of the constiyuent molecules in each generation,i.e., linkage disequilibrium at the population level is neglected. In particular, for the single-sharp-peak replication landscape we investigate the dependence of the error threshold on the population size and find that the replication accuracy at threshold increases linearly with the reciprocal of the population size for sufficiently large populations. Furthermore, in the deterministic limit our formulation yields the exact steady-state of the quasispecies model, indicating then the population composition is a random combination of the molecules.
D1-893	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone, the green ballet performed by chloroplasts within plant cells. Harnessing sunlight's energy, these organelles convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only fuels the plant but also supports Earth's ecosystem, providing the oxygen we breathe and serving as the foundation for food chains. Furthermore, photosynthesis is integral to the carbon cycle, sequestering carbon dioxide and mitigating its harmful effects on climate. As we navigate the challenges of our changing world, understanding and appreciating photosynthesis becomes crucial in devising sustainable solutions for our future.
D1-894	Biological diversity has evolved despite the essentially infinite complexity of protein sequence space. We present a hierarchical approach to the efficient searching of this space and quantify the evolutionary potential of our approach with Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations demonstrate that non-homologous juxtaposition of encoded structure is the rate-limiting step in the production of new tertiary protein folds. Non-homologous ``swapping'' of low energy secondary structures increased the binding constant of a simulated protein by $\approx10^7$ relative to base substitution alone. Applications of our approach include the generation of new protein folds and modeling the molecular evolution of disease.
D1-895	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the life-sustaining dance between plants and sunlight. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plant cells, captures sunlight's energy, converting it into chemical energy through a series of reactions. This transformation occurs within the chloroplasts, tiny organelles within plant cells. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, absorbed through tiny pores called stomata, is integrated into the synthesized glucose molecules. Oxygen, a byproduct of this process, is released back into the atmosphere, completing the symbiotic cycle that sustains most life on Earth.
D1-896	I consider a topographic projection between two neuronal layers with different densities of neurons. Given the number of output neurons connected to each input neuron (divergence) and the number of input neurons synapsing on each output neuron (convergence) I determine the widths of axonal and dendritic arbors which minimize the total volume of axons and dendrites. Analytical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional projections can be summarized qualitatively in the following rule: neurons of the sparser layer should have arbors wider than those of the denser layer. This agrees with the anatomical data from retinal and cerebellar neurons whose morphology and connectivity are known. The rule may be used to infer connectivity of neurons from their morphology.
D1-897	 In the expansive tapestry of life, photosynthesis, the symphony of green, is a pivotal process. This miraculous dance transpires within the leaves of plants, algae, and some bacteria. Harnessing sunlight's energy, they convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This elementary yet profound exchange is the foundation of most life on Earth, sustaining our atmosphere and providing energy for countless organisms. It's a testament to nature's ingenuity, a constant reminder of life's resilience and the intricate balance that governs our planet.
D1-898	Selection theory requires multiple, distinct, simultaneously-actualized states. In cognition, each thought or cognitive state changes the 'selection pressure' against which the next is evaluated. they are not simultaneously selected amongst. Creative thought is more a matter of honing in a vague idea through redescribing successive iterations of it from different real or imagined perspectives. in other words, actualizing potential through exposure to different contexts. It has been proven that the mathematical description of contextual change of state introduces a non-Kolmogorovian probability distribution, and a classical formalism such as selection theory cannot be used. This paper argues that creative thought evolves not through a Darwinian process, but a process of context-driven actualization of potential.
D1-899	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the blueprint of life. DNA, short for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, is a double-stranded molecule composed of nucleotides. These nucleotides carry the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all living organisms. Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. The sequence of these bases determines the genetic code, governing everything from eye color to hair texture. This code is read by the cell's protein-making machinery, leading to the creation of proteins essential for life. Understanding DNA and its role in genetics opens avenues for genetic engineering, personalized medicine, and even the treatment of genetic diseases.
D1-900	Noise aids the encoding of continuous signals into pulse sequences by way of stochastic resonance and endows the encoding device with a preferred frequency. We study encoding by a threshold device based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, equivalent to the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. Preferred frequency, optimum noise intensity, and optimum signal-to-noise ratio are shown to be linearly related to the AC amplitude of the input signal. The DC component of the input tunes the device either into transmission (preferred frequency nearly independent of signal amplitude) or selection mode (frequency rising with amplitude). We argue that this behavior may facilitate selective signal processing in neurons.
D1-901	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the intriguing phenomenon of epigenetics. Beyond the DNA sequence, epigenetics explores modifications that alter gene expression, without changing the actual DNA code. Encompassing DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA, epigenetics offers insights into how environmental factors, behaviors, and lifestyle choices can impact our gene activity, and consequently, our health and development. This dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics underscores the complexity of life at the molecular level, opening doors to potential preventive and therapeutic strategies in medicine.
D1-902	We investigate the relationship between the average fitness decay due to single mutations and the strength of epistatic interactions in genetic sequences. We observe that epistatic interactions between mutations are correlated to the average fitness decay, both in RNA secondary structure prediction as well as in digital organisms replicating in silico. This correlation implies that during adaptation, epistasis and average mutational effect cannot be optimized independently. In experiments with RNA sequences evolving on a neutral network, the selective pressure to decrease the mutational load then leads to a reduction of the amount of sequences with strong antagonistic interactions between deleterious mutations in the population.
D1-903	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the fascinating realm of DNA replication. This biological process, essential for life, duplicates the genetic instructions carried within each cell. By harnessing enzymes like helicase, topoisomerase, and DNA polymerase, the double helix splits apart, serving as a mold for new strands to form. Each strand acts as a template, recruiting nucleotides in a precise sequence, thereby recreating the original DNA. This meticulous dance of molecular machinery ensures the accuracy and fidelity of genetic information, ensuring the continuity of life across generations.
D1-904	Finding out statistically significant words in DNA and protein sequences forms the basis for many genetic studies. By applying the maximal entropy principle, we give one systematic way to study the nonrandom occurrence of words in DNA or protein sequences. Through comparison with experimental results, it was shown that patterns of regulatory binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) genomes tend to occur significantly in the promoter regions. We studied two correlated gene family of yeast. The method successfully extracts the binding sites varified by experiments in each family. Many putative regulatory sites in the upstream regions are proposed. The study also suggested that some regulatory sites are a ctive in both directions, while others show directional preference.
D1-905	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet, orchestrated by green plants and photosynthetic organisms. Using sunlight as their primary energy source, they convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, releasing the latter into the atmosphere. This process not only fuels their growth but also sustains Earth's wildlife by providing the essential oxygen they need to breathe. Moreover, the glucose serves as a building block for complex organic molecules, further substantiating the foundation of life. This symphony of photosynthesis, though silent, forms the backbone of Earth's ecosystem, intertwining all living beings in a delicate web of survival.
D1-906	The presence of low dimensional chaos in the protein secondary structures, using the binary coded $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheet motifs, has been investigated. In order to analyse symbolic DNA/RNA sequences the assignment, based on the purine/pyrimidine and strong/wea k H - bond classification sheme, of binary numbers to the nucleotides was made. We have found that this assignment leads to different averaged fractal dimensions for $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets. When embedded in the two dimensional phase space the binary string structures show the attractor type behavior which depends on the value of the time lag parameter.
D1-907	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves contemplating the DNA double helix - a spiral staircase of life. This molecular masterpiece stores our genetic code, the blueprint of our very existence. Each strand, a meticulous sequence of nucleotides, represents the instructions for growth, function, and reproduction. In the dance of life, DNA is the choreographer, directing the symphony of cellular processes with precision and elegance. It's a testament to nature's complexity, a silent whisper of our shared ancestry, and a key to understanding our place in the grand scheme of evolution.
D1-908	We investigate the competition between two quasispecies residing on two disparate neutral networks. Under the assumption that the two neutral networks have different topologies and fitness levels, it is the mutation rate that determines which quasispecies will eventually be driven to extinction. For small mutation rates, we find that the quasispecies residing on the neutral network with the lower replication rate will disappear. For higher mutation rates, however, the faster replicating sequences may be outcompeted by the slower replicating ones in case the connection density on the second neutral network is sufficiently high. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with flow-reactor simulations of replicating RNA sequences.
D1-909	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. It's composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, linked together in a double helix structure. During cell division, this structure is meticulously replicated, ensuring the transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. The sequences of these bases, or genes, dictate the structure and function of proteins, which perform countless roles within the organism. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can lead to a myriad of outcomes, from harmless to potentially life-threatening, shedding light on the delicate balance that governs the realm of heredity and evolution.
D1-910	We propose a solution on the stopping criterion in segmenting inhomogeneous DNA sequences with complex statistical patterns. This new stopping criterion is based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in the model selection framework. When this stopping criterion is applied to a left telomere sequence of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the complete genome sequence of bacterium Escherichia coli, borders of biologically meaningful units were identified (e.g. subtelomeric units, replication origin, and replication terminus), and a more reasonable number of domains was obtained. We also introduce a measure called segmentation strength which can be used to control the delineation of large domains. The relationship between the average domain size and the threshold of segmentation strength is determined for several genome sequences.
D1-911	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we find the intriguing phenomenon of epigenetics. This field explores changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it focuses on modifications to the structure of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins where genetic information resides. Epigenetic changes can be caused by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. These alterations can influence the development, functioning, and even the behavior of an organism. Epigenetics adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of heredity, suggesting that our genes, and thus our characteristics, might not be as fixed as once thought. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment opens up exciting possibilities for personalized medicine and a deeper appreciation for the intricate web of life.
D1-912	Active phenomena which involve force generation and motion play a key role in a number of phenomena in living cells such as cell motility, muscle contraction and the active transport of material and organelles. Here we discuss mechanical oscillations generated by active systems in cells. Examples are oscillatory regimes in muscles, the periodic beating of axonemal cilia and flagella and spontaneous oscillations of auditory hair cells which play a role in active amplification of weak sounds in hearing. As a prototype system for oscillation generation by proteins, we discuss a general mechanism by which many coupled active elements such as motor molecules can generate oscillations.
D1-913	 Delving into the intricacies of cellular communication, we find that signaling proteins play a pivotal role. These proteins, often receptors, transmit signals from outside the cell to inside, orchestrating a cascade of events that control cell behavior. One such signaling pathway is the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway, which regulates crucial cell activities like proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Upon activation, MAPK proteins phosphorylate downstream targets, setting off a chain reaction that ultimately influences gene expression and cell fate. This delicate dance of proteins and phosphorylation events underscores the intricate network of signaling pathways that govern cellular behavior, a testament to the complexity and beauty of biological systems.
D1-914	The possibility to use sucrose solutions as medium for X-ray and neutron small-angle scattering experiments has been explored for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles and mixed DMPC/C_(12)E_(8) aggregates. The influence of sucrose concentration on phospholipid vesicles size and polydispersity has been investigated by complimentary X-ray and neutron scattering. Sucrose solutions decreased vesicle size and polydispersity and increased a contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent sufficiently for X-rays. 40% sucrose in H2O increased X-ray contrast by up to 10 times compared to pure H2O. The range of sucrose concentration 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for the X-ray small-angle experiment with phospholipid vesicles.
D1-915	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene houses instructions for the production of proteins, essential for life's functions. Genes are strung together on chromosomes, thread-like structures within a cell's nucleus. During cell division, these chromosomes replicate and separate, ensuring each new cell receives a complete set of genes. Mutations, alterations in the gene sequence, can occur, sometimes causing genetic disorders. DNA, the molecule that carries our genes, is a double helix, a structure so remarkable it earned James Watson and Francis Crick the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. This double helix, with its four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - holds the key to understanding life at its most basic level.
D1-916	We present initial results regarding the existence, stability and interaction of linear and nonlinear vibrational modes in a system of two coupled, one dimensional lattices with unequal numbers of masses. The effects on these nonlinear modes of coupling a near continuum system to a discrete system using a nonlinear coupling are examined. This numerical model is a first step towards investigating the dynamical behavior of a flexible sheet coupled nonlinearly to a semi-rigid support, a system which could conceivably represent a biological cell membrane with a supporting protein network. General implications for the dynamical behavior of continuum systems coupled nonlinearly to discrete systems are introduced.
D1-917	 Delving into the intriguing world of genetics, we find ourselves captivated by the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double-helix structure, a marvel of nature's engineering, carries the genetic instructions for every living organism. Each segment, or gene, within this molecule is a coded sequence that determines specific traits, from eye color to height. Mutations, alterations in these sequences, can lead to genetic disorders or adaptive advantages, shaping the evolution of species. Understanding DNA and its workings offers profound insights into life itself, bridging the gap between science and the essence of being.
D1-918	Graph Theoretic Process Network Synthesis is described as an introduction to biological networks. Genetic, protein and metabolic systems are considered. The theoretical work of Kauffman is discussed and amplified by critical property excursions. The scaling apparent in biological systems is shown. Applications to evolution and reverse engineering are construed. The use of several programs, such as the Synprops, Design of molecules, Therm and Knapsack are suggested as instruments to study biological process network synthesis. The properties of robust self-assembly and Self-Organizing synthesis are important contributors to the discussion. The bar code of life and intelligent design is reviewed. The need for better data in biological systems is emphasized.
D1-919	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the remarkable protein, p53, often hailed as the 'guardian of the genome.' This tumor suppressor protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genetic stability within our cells. It acts as a sentinel, monitoring for any DNA damage that may occur due to various factors. Upon detecting such damage, p53 triggers a cascade of responses, including cell repair mechanisms, or if the damage is beyond repair, it initiates apoptosis – programmed cell death – to prevent further mutations that could lead to cancerous growth. Its influence spans across numerous cellular processes, substantiating its significance in maintaining the delicate balance of life and disease.
D1-920	Textual analysis of typical microbial genomes reveals that they have the statistical characteristics of a DNA sequence of a much shorter length. This peculiar property supports an evolutionary model in which a genome evolves by random mutation but primarily grows by random segmental self-copying. That genomes grew mostly by self-copying is consistent with the observation that repeat sequences in all genomes are widespread and intragenomic and intergenomic homologous genes are preponderance across all life forms. The model predicates the coexistence of the two competing modes of evolution: the gradual changes of classical Darwinism and the stochastic spurts envisioned in ``punctuated equilibrium''.
D1-921	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the hereditary material, unfolding its secrets. This double-helix molecule, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions for life. Genes, segments of DNA, dictate traits, from eye color to height, triggering protein synthesis. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders. Epigenetics, a relatively new field, explores modifications outside the DNA sequence, affecting gene expression. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential for treating diseases and improving human health. The fascinating interplay between genes, proteins, and environment shapes our biological diversity, opening doors to new scientific discoveries and medical advancements.
D1-922	The random map model is a deterministic dynamical system in a finite phase space with n points. The map that establishes the dynamics of the system is constructed by randomly choosing, for every point, another one as being its image. We derive here explicit formulas for the statistical distribution of the number of attractors in the system. As in related results, the number of operations involved by our formulas increases exponentially with n. therefore, they are not directly applicable to study the behavior of systems where n is large. However, our formulas lend themselves to derive useful asymptotic expressions, as we show.
D1-923	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule at its core. This double helix, a mere 2 meters long in a human cell, houses the blueprint for life. It carries four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, forming the language of our genetic code. Alterations, or mutations, in this code can lead to diseases or traits, as the sequence dictates the structure and function of proteins. Understanding this language, we can decode the secrets of inheritance, evolution, and even predict potential health issues. Genetics, thus, illuminates the intricate dance between our genes and the journey of life.
D1-924	This chapter describes gene expression analysis by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), emphasizing initial characterization of the data. We describe SVD methods for visualization of gene expression data, representation of the data using a smaller number of variables, and detection of patterns in noisy gene expression data. In addition, we describe the precise relation between SVD analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) when PCA is calculated using the covariance matrix, enabling our descriptions to apply equally well to either method. Our aim is to provide definitions, interpretations, examples, and references that will serve as resources for understanding and extending the application of SVD and PCA to gene expression analysis.
D1-925	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries instructions for a specific trait or characteristic in an organism. These genes are housed within chromosomes within the cell's nucleus. DNA, the genetic material, holds these instructions, a double helix of nucleotides that undergoes replication during cell division. Alleles, alternative forms of the same gene, can result in variation among individuals, a testament to the dynamic and adaptive nature of life. Gene expression, the process by which the information in a gene is translated into a functional product, drives the development and functioning of organisms. Understanding these principles allows us to explore the complexities of inheritance, evolution, and the biological world at large.
D1-926	Using data from gene expression databases on various organisms and tissues, including yeast, nematodes, human normal and cancer tissues, and embryonic stem cells, we found that the abundances of expressed genes exhibit a power-law distribution with an exponent close to -1, i.e., they obey Zipf's law. Furthermore, by simulations of a simple model with an intra-cellular reaction network, we found that Zipf's law of chemical abundance is a universal feature of cells where such a network optimizes the efficiency and faithfulness of self-reproduction. These findings provide novel insights into the nature of the organization of reaction dynamics in living cells.
D1-927	 Delving into cellular biology, we encounter mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell. These organelles, unique in eukaryotic cells, generate energy through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria's double membrane structure houses various enzymes that facilitate this energy production. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the cell's nucleus, suggesting an intriguing evolutionary past. The dynamic nature of mitochondria, capable of dividing and replicating, ensures efficient energy production across the cell. Their crucial role in cellular metabolism substantiates their importance in maintaining life's vital processes.
D1-928	The GOR program for predicting protein secondary structure is extended to include triple correlation. A score system for a residue pair to be at certain conformation state is derived from the conditional weight matrix describing amino acid frequencies at each position of a window flanking the pair under the condition for the pair to be at the fixed state. A program using this score system to predict protein secondary structure is established. After training the model with a learning set created from PDB\_SELECT, the program is tested with two test sets. As a method using single sequence for predicting secondary structures, the approach achieves a high accuracy near 70%.
D1-929	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet, an act performed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria. This process, a harmonious fusion of water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, heralds the creation of glucose and oxygen. The carbon dioxide, absorbed from the atmosphere, unites with water within the chloroplast, the plant's energy-generating compartment. Under the spotlight of sunlight, energy is harnessed, transforming water molecules into a high-energy form and splitting carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. The carbon then combines with the energy to form glucose, a vital energy source for the plant itself, while the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and life on Earth.
D1-930	What determines the caliber of axonal branches? We pursue the hypothesis that the axonal caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We show that for a general cost function the optimal diameters of mother ($d_0$) and daughter ($d_1$, $d_2$) branches at a bifurcation obey a branching law: $d_{0}^{\nu+2}=d_{1}^{\nu+2} + d_{2}^{\nu+2}$. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed scales with the axon diameter to the power $\nu$ ($\nu=1$ for myelinated axons and $\nu=0.5$ for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the available experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.

D1-932	Several technological applications require the translation of a protein into a nucleic acid that codes for it (``backtranslation''). The degeneracy of the genetic code makes this translation ambiguous. moreover, not every translation is equally viable. The common answer to this problem is the imitation of the codon usage of the target species. Here we discuss several other features of coding sequences (``coding statistics'') that are relevant for the ``genomic style'' of different species. A genetic algorithm is then used to obtain backtranslations that mimic these styles, by minimizing the difference in the coding statistics. Possible improvements and applications are discussed.
D1-933	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis stands as a testament to nature's diversity and adaptability. This mutualistic relationship, where two different organisms live in close proximity, benefits both parties. For instance, consider the coral and the algae that dwell within its structure. The algae photosynthesize, producing oxygen and sugars, which the coral uses for energy and growth. In return, the coral provides the algae with a safe haven and nutrients. This harmonious coexistence underscores the profound interconnectedness that governs the biological world, where every organism contributes to the intricate web of life.
D1-934	We present a detailed study of the transport and the efficiency of a ratchet system in a periodic potential in the presence of correlated noises.   The current and the efficiency of the system are investigated. It is found that, when the potential is spatially symmetric, the correlation between the two noises can induce a net transport. The efficiency shows many interesting features as a function of the applied force, the noise intensity, the external load, etc. The efficiency can be maximized as a function of noise intensity (or temperature), which shows that the thermal fluctuation can facilitate the efficiency of energy transformation.

We have looked for geometrical parameters of cortical circuits, which maximize information storage capacity associated with this mechanism. In particular, we calculated optimal volume fractions of various neuropil components. The optimal axonal and dendritic volume fractions are not significantly different from anatomical measurements in the mouse and rat neocortex, and the rat hippocampus. This has led us to propose that the maximization of information storage capacity associated with dendritic spine remodeling may have been an important driving force in the evolution of the cortex.

Since 1998 a single-ion irradiation facility has been developed on the focused horizontal microbeam line of the CENBG 3.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. This setup delivers in air single protons and alpha particles of a few MeV onto cultured cells, with a spatial resolution of a few microns, allowing subcellular targeting. In this paper, we present results from the use of the GEANT4 toolkit to simulate cellular irradiation with the CENBG microbeam line, from the entrance to the microprobe up to the cellular medium.

Chlorophyll, a green pigment, is the key player in this process. Utilizing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil, these organisms harness sunlight to produce glucose, a fundamental source of energy, and release oxygen as a byproduct, a vital component for respiration in most organisms. Photosynthesis not only sustains life on Earth but also regulates our planet's oxygen levels and carbon cycle, creating a delicate balance essential for survival.
D1-940	An analytical expression has been developed to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and diffusing spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time, delaying the re-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture. In the classical picture the unwinding rate of spatially twisted magnetization is no longer constant, but decays exponentially with time. The expression is experimentally verified for the HOMOGENIZED spectrum of 100mM TSP in H2O at 4.7T.

Yet, our understanding of this vast genetic code is still in its infancy, paving the way for future advancements in medicine, agriculture, and beyond.
D1-942	The effects of the exposure of the bacterium, Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola to a constant magnetic field with magnetic flux density from a permanent ferrite magnet = 140 mT were studied. Changes in Leptospira cells after their exposure to the field were determined on the basis of changes in their growth behavior and agglutination immunoreactivity with a homologous antiserum using darkfield microscopy together with visual imaging. The data showed that the exposed Leptospira cells have lower densities and lower agglutination immunoreactivity than the unexposed control group. Interestingly, some of the exposed Leptospira cells showed abnormal morphologies such as large lengths. We discussed some of the possible reasons for these observations.
D1-943	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, harmonizing energy flow within ecosystems. This biochemical marvel, carried out by plants and some microorganisms, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This life-sustaining cycle supports nearly all organisms on Earth, fueling food chains and maintaining our planet's oxygen levels. Photosynthesis is not just a process. it's an underlying beat, a rhythm that continuously pulses, enabling life to flourish and thrive.
D1-944	We study the statistical mechanics of RNA secondary structures designed to have an attraction between two different types of structures as a model system for heteropolymer aggregation. The competition between the branching entropy of the secondary structure and the energy gained by pairing drives the RNA to undergo a `temperature independent' second order phase transition from a molten to an aggregated phase'. The aggregated phase thus obtained has a macroscopically large number of contacts between different RNAs. The partition function scaling exponent for this phase is \theta ~ 1/2 and the crossover exponent of the phase transition is \nu ~ 5/3. The relevance of these calculations to the aggregation of biological molecules is discussed.
D1-945	 In the intricate world of genetics, a fascinating discovery unfolds: epigenetics. This field delves deeper into the DNA code, exploring how external factors, such as environment and lifestyle, can alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes can be inherited, yet they are reversible, offering a new perspective on disease susceptibility and potential treatments. For instance, a high-fat diet might lead to epigenetic changes that promote obesity and related health issues. Conversely, these changes can be reversed through diet modification, exercise, or pharmacological interventions. Epigenetics bridges the gap between nature and nurture, emphasizing that our lifestyle choices can significantly impact our genetic destiny.
D1-946	We report experimental observations on the effect of disorder on the phase behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. Variation in DNA linker lengths results in different melting temperatures of the DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. We observed an unusual trend of a non-monotonic ``zigzag'' pattern in the melting temperature as a function of DNAlinker length. Linker DNA resulting in unequal DNA duplex lengths introduces disorder and lowers the melting temperature of the nanoparticle system. Comparison with free DNA thermodynamics shows that such an anomalous zigzag pattern does not exist for free DNA duplex melting, which suggests that the disorder introduced by unequal DNA duplex lengths results in this unusual collective behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies.
D1-947	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis stands as a captivating testament to the harmony between different species. This mutualistic relationship, as seen in coral and algae or in the gut of a termite, benefits both parties, fostering an ecosystem's resilience. The algae photosynthesize, producing oxygen and sugars, while the coral provides a home and nutrients. Similarly, termites consume cellulose indigestible to most organisms, but their gut bacteria break it down, allowing the termites to thrive. These symbiotic partnerships underscore the interdependence of life forms, adding another layer to the complexity of our planet's biodiversity.
D1-948	We seek to determine the mechanism of like-charge attraction by measuring the temperature dependence of critical divalent counterion concentration ($\rm{C_{c}}$) for the aggregation of fd viruses. We find that an increase in temperature causes $\rm{C_c}$ to decrease, primarily due to a decrease in the dielectric constant ($\epsilon$) of the solvent. At a constant $\epsilon$, $\rm{C_c}$ is found to increase as the temperature increases. The effects of $T$ and $\epsilon$ on $\rm {C_{c}}$ can be combined to that of one parameter: Bjerrum length ($l_{B}$). $\rm{C_{c}}$ decreases exponentially as $l_{B}$ increases, suggesting that entropic effect of counterions plays an important role at the onset of bundle formation.
D1-949	 In the vibrant world of genetics, the intriguing concept of epigenetics unfolds. Unlike traditional DNA sequencing, epigenetics focuses on chemical modifications that alter gene expression, without changing the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily methylation and acetylation, govern which genes are 'switched on' or 'switched off'. Environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and toxins, can influence these modifications, leading to a dynamic interplay between genes and the environment. This dance of genes and epigenetic markers shapes our development, aging process, and even susceptibility to diseases, offering a fresh perspective on heredity and health.
D1-950	Because of growing interest in temperature-based sampling methods like replica exchange, this note aims to make some observations and raise some potentially important questions which we have not seen addressed sufficiently in the literature. Mainly, we wish to call attention to limits on the maximum speed-up to be expected from temperature-based methods, and also note the need for careful quantification of sampling efficiency. Because potentially lengthy studies may be necessary to address these issues, we felt it would be useful to bring them to the attention of the broader community. Here \emph{we are strictly concerned with canonical sampling at a fixed temperature,} and \emph{not} with conformational search.
D1-951	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the molecule of life. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, holds the blueprint for every living organism, encoding the instructions for growth, development, and maintenance. This double helix, a spiral staircase of nucleotides, is a testament to nature's intricate design, with each nucleotide representing a letter in the genetic code. Mutations, tiny alterations in this code, can have profound effects, driving evolution and diversity. Understanding DNA is not just a scientific pursuit. it offers promises for personalized medicine, conservation efforts, and even a deeper understanding of our shared ancestry. The realm of DNA, then, opens doors to a wealth of knowledge and possibilities.
D1-952	Usual formulations of the clustering coefficient can be shown to be insufficient in the task of describing the local topology of very simple networks. Motivated by this, we review some alternatives in order to present an extension, the clustering profile. We show, both conceptually and through applications to well studied networks, that this measure is a more complete and robust measure of clustering. It imposes stringent constraints on theoretical growth models, specially on aspects of the network structure that play a central role in dynamics on networks. In addition, we study how it provides a richer perspective of phenomena such as hierarchy, small-worlds and clusterization.
D1-953	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal act. Green leaves, nature's chlorophyll-infused canvases, absorb sunlight and transform it into life-sustaining energy. Carbon dioxide, drawn from the air, becomes the raw material for plant growth. Water, absorbed through roots, is the essential solvent, catalyzing this incredible chemical reaction. Oxygen, a byproduct of this process, is released back into the atmosphere, sustaining the very organisms that made it possible. This symbiotic cycle, a testament to life's resilience and adaptability, underscores the delicate balance that governs our world.
D1-954	It is known that the action of general anesthetics is proportional to their partition coefficient in lipid membranes (Meyer-Overton rule). This solubility is, however, directly related to the depression of the temperature of the melting transition found close to body temperature in biomembranes. We propose a thermodynamic extension of the Meyer-Overton rule which is based on free energy changes in the system and thus automatically incorporates the effects of melting point depression. This model provides a quantitative explanation of the pressure reversal of anesthesia. Further, it explains why inflammation and the addition of divalent cations reduce the effectiveness of anesthesia.
D1-955	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a process central to life on Earth, unfolds. Green leaves, the solar panels of the plant kingdom, absorb sunlight, converting it into chemical energy through this biological miracle. Carbon dioxide, drawn from the air, merges with water to form glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symbiotic dance between plants and the atmosphere sustains our world, providing the very air we breathe and the food that feeds us. It's a testament to the astounding complexity and interconnectedness of life, a testament to nature's boundless ingenuity.
D1-956	This paper introduces the use of cable dynamics models as a means to explore the mechanics of DNA on long-length scales. It is on these length scales that DNA forms twisted and curved three-dimensional shapes known as supercoils and loops. These long-length scale DNA structures have a pronounced influence on the functions of this molecule within the cell including the packing of DNA in the cell nucleus, transcription, replication and gene repair. We provide a short background to the mechanics of DNA and suggest the logical connection to the mechanics of a low tension cable. A computational model is then summarized and example results are presented for DNA supercoiling and looping.
D1-957	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a pivotal process, converting sunlight into chemical energy, fueling the growth of plants and algae. This biochemical reaction, initiated by chlorophyll within the chloroplasts, generates glucose and oxygen, both integral to sustaining life on Earth. Plants, in return, provide a vital source of food and oxygen for all organisms, while also playing an essential role in the global carbon cycle, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This symbiotic relationship underscores the crucial interconnectedness of life forms on our planet.
D1-958	Theories of solvation free energies often involve electrostatic potentials at the position of a solute charge. Simulation calculations that apply cutoffs and periodic boundary conditions based on molecular centers result in center-dependent contributions to electrostatic energies due to a systematic sorting of charges in radial shells. This sorting of charges induces a surface-charge density at the cutoff sphere or simulation-box boundary that depends on the choice of molecular centers. We identify a simple solution that gives correct, center-independent results, namely the radial integration of charge densities. Our conclusions are illustrated for a Lennard-Jones solute in water. The present results can affect the parameterization of force fields.
D1-959	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves at the crossroads of DNA and RNA, the molecular building blocks of life. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, serves as the genetic blueprint for every living organism, meticulously encoding genetic information. In contrast, ribonucleic acid, or RNA, functions as a messenger, transporting genetic instructions from DNA to the protein-making machinery of the cell. This dynamic dance of DNA and RNA is the essence of genetic expression, shaping the very fabric of life, from the simplest bacteria to the complexities of human biology.
D1-960	A simple mathematical homogeneous model of competition is used to describe Neanderthal extinction in Europe. It considers two interacting species, Neanderthals and Early Modern Men, in the same ecological niche. Using paleontological data we claim that the parameter of similarity, between both species, fluctuates between 0.992 and 0.997. An extension of the model including migration (diffusion) is also discussed nevertheless, extinction of Neanderthal seems unavoidable. Numerical analysis of travelling wave solution (fronts) comfirms the extinction. The wave-front-velocity is estimated from linear analysis and numerical simulations confirm this estimation. We conjecture a mathematical formulation for the principle of exclusion between competitive interacting species (Gause).
D1-961	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, the biochemical process that converts light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria harness this power, using carbon dioxide and water to generate glucose and oxygen. This process, occurring in chloroplasts, is essential for sustaining life on Earth. Photosynthesis not only feeds plants themselves but also supports the entire ecosystem, providing oxygen for animals and sequestering carbon dioxide, thereby mitigating climate change. A world without photosynthesis would be a world bereft of greenery, stripped of its vibrant colors, and devoid of the breath of life.
D1-962	We develop a formulation for molecular dynamics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms in the recently proposed generalized ensemble that is based on a physically motivated realisation of Tsallis weights. The effectiveness of the methods are tested with an energy function for a protein system. Simulations in this generalized ensemble by the three methods are performed for a penta peptide, Met-enkephalin. For each algorithm, it is shown that from only one simulation run one can not only find the global-minimum-energy conformation but also obtain probability distributions in canonical ensemble at any temperature, which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature.
D1-963	 Delving into the intricacies of genetics, we encounter the DNA molecule, a double helix structure that houses our genetic code. This code, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - dictates the development, function, and traits of every organism. The human genome, for instance, is a complex tapestry of over three billion base pairs. Genetic mutations, alterations in this code, can lead to a myriad of effects, from subtle differences in appearance to severe diseases. Understanding genetics is crucial in medicine, allowing us to diagnose, prevent, and treat various conditions more effectively. The study of genetics, therefore, illuminates the mysteries of life, bridging the gap between science and humanity.
D1-964	In this paper we investigate error-thresholds on dynamics fitness-landscapes. We show that there exists both lower and an upper threshold, representing limits to the copying fidelity of simple replicators. The lower bound can be expressed as a correction term to the error-threshold present on a static landscape. The upper error-threshold is a new limit that only exists on dynamic fitness-landscapes. We also show that for long genomes on highly dynamic fitness-landscapes there exists a lower bound on the selection pressure needed to enable effective selection of genomes with superior fitness independent of mutation rates, i.e., there are distinct limits to the evolutionary parameters in dynamic environments.
D1-965	 Delve into the captivating world of bioluminescence, a natural phenomenon that illuminates the night in various marine and terrestrial species. This radiant display is the result of a chemical reaction within the organism, producing a cold light without the involvement of a heated filament. Commonly found in deep-sea creatures like jellyfish, squid, and certain bacteria, bioluminescence serves multiple purposes, such as communication, attracting prey, or deterring predators. For instance, fireflies use this light to find mates, while anglerfish employ it to lure unsuspecting prey towards their mouths. This mesmerizing spectacle of nature continues to intrigue scientists and spark curiosity in us all, shedding light on the fascinating mysteries that lie beneath the surface.
D1-966	Recently, renormalized entropy was proposed as a novel measure of relative entropy (P. Saparin et al., Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 4, 1907 (1994)) and applied to several physiological time sequences, including EEGs of patients with epilepsy. We show here that this measure is just a modified Kullback-Leibler (K-L) relative entropy, and it gives similar numerical results to the standard K-L entropy. The latter better distinguishes frequency contents of e.g. seizure and background EEGs than renormalized entropy. We thus propose that renormalized entropy might not be as useful as claimed by its proponents. In passing we also make some critical remarks about the implementation of these methods.
D1-967	 Diving into the intricacies of genetics, we uncover the DNA molecule's vital role. This double helix, a twisted ladder of sorts, encodes the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and maintenance. Each cell in a multicellular organism houses this genetic blueprint, stored within the nucleus. Genes, segments of the DNA, are the functional units that determine an organism's traits. Alterations or mutations in these genes can lead to genetic disorders, illustrating the delicate balance and importance of this genetic code. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insight into heredity, evolution, and our fundamental understanding of life itself.
D1-968	In this paper we argue that the pattern of cell movements in the morphogenetic process known as convergent extension can be understood as a energy minimization process, provided the cell-cell adhesive energy has a certain kind of anisotropy. This single simple property is sufficient cause for the type of cell elongation, alignment, and intercalation of a cellular array that is the characteristic of convergent extension. We describe the type of anisotropy required. We show that the final aspect ratio of the array of cells is independent of the initial configuration and of the degree of cell elongation. We find how it depends on the anisotropy.
D1-969	 In the fascinating world of genetics, DNA sequencing unveils the intricate blueprint of life. Each strand of deoxyribonucleic acid, a double helix of nucleotides, carries coded instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. DNA sequencing technology, through techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, deciphers this genetic code, revealing variations that underpin inheritable traits and disease susceptibility. This knowledge fuels research in medicine, agriculture, and conservation, offering insights to cure diseases, develop crops more resilient to climate change, and protect endangered species, respectively. The human genome project, a landmark in DNA sequencing, has opened doors to a new era of personalized medicine, promising tailored treatments based on an individual's unique genetic makeup. As technology advances, the potential applications of DNA sequencing continue to expand, promising a deeper understanding of life and the development of novel solutions to pressing global challenges.
D1-970	We examine interacting cognitive modules of human biology which, in the asymptotic limit of long sequences of responses, define the output of an appropriate 'dual' information source. Applying a 'necessary condition' communication theory formalism roughly similar to that of Dretske, but focused entirely on long sequences of signals, we examine the regularities apparent in comorbid psychiatric and chronic physical disorders using an extension of recent perspectives on autoimmune disease. We find that structured psychosocial stress can literally write a distorted image of itself onto child development, resulting in a life course trajectory to characteristic forms of comorbid mind/body dysfunction affecting both dominant and subordinate populations within a pathogenic social hierarchy.
D1-971	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, the fundamental unit of heredity. Genes, carried on chromosomes, encode the instructions for protein synthesis, shaping an organism's traits. DNA, the genetic material, is a double helix structure that stores the genetic code. During cell division, this code is replicated and distributed equally to daughter cells. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can occur, leading to genetic variability and, potentially, new traits. These genetic alterations can be caused by errors during replication, exposure to mutagens, or transposable elements moving within the DNA. This constant interplay between stability and change is crucial for evolution, as it allows species to adapt to their environment over time.
D1-972	An analysis of the Kimura 3ST model of DNA sequence evolution is given on the basis of its continuous Lie symmetries. The rate matrix commutes with a U(1)xU(1)xU(1) phase subgroup of the group GL(4) of 4x4x4 invertible complex matrices acting on a linear space spanned by the 4 nucleic acid base letters. The diagonal `branching operator' representing speciation is defined, and shown to intertwine the U(1)xU(1)xU(1) action. Using the intertwining property, a general formula for the probability density on the leaves of a binary tree under the Kimura model is derived, which is shown to be equivalent to established phylogenetic spectral transform methods.
D1-973	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the genetic blueprint of all living organisms. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is a double-stranded molecule, intricately coiled into a structure known as a double helix. Each strand consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone, with nucleotide bases attached at regular intervals. These bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), pair up in a precise manner, ensuring the integrity and replication of the genetic code. The sequence of these bases, like a complex language, carries the instructions for growth, development, and function of an organism, making DNA an essential cornerstone of life.
D1-974	Examining elevated rates of systemic lupus erythematosus in African-American women from perspectives of immune cognition suggests the disease constitutes an internalized physiological image of external structured psychosocial stress, a 'pathogenic social hierarchy' involving the synergism of racism and gender discrimination in the context of policy-driven social disintegration which has particularly affected ethnic minorities in the USA. The disorder represents the punctuated resetting of normal immune self-image to a self-attacking excited state, a process formally analogous to models of punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory. Both onset and progression of disease may be stratified by a relation to cyclic physiological responses which are long in comparison with heartbeat period: circadian, hormonal, and annual light/termperature cycles.
D1-975	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, the DNA molecule, a double helix structure, serves as the blueprint for all living organisms. Each DNA strand houses four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, forming a unique sequence that determines an organism's genetic makeup. Genes, segments of DNA, encode instructions for the synthesis of proteins, which play crucial roles in every cellular process. Genetic variation arises due to changes in these DNA sequences, contributing to the diversity observed among species. This diversity, in turn, enables adaptability, ensuring survival and evolution in response to changing environments. The intricate dance of genes and proteins is a testament to the complexity and resilience of life, continually unfolding mysteries and driving the pursuit of scientific discovery.
D1-976	We study the steady state of an assembly of microtubules in a confined volume, analogous to the situation inside a cell where the cell boundary forms a natural barrier to growth. We show that the dynamical equations for growing and shrinking microtubules predict the existence of two steady states, with either exponentially decaying or exponentially increasing distribution of microtubule lengths. We identify the regimes in parameter space corresponding to these steady states. In the latter case, the apparent catastrophe frequency near the boundary was found to be significantly larger than that in the interior. Both the exponential distribution of lengths and the increase in the catastrophe frequency near the cell margin is in excellent agreement with recent experimental observations.
D1-977	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as the cornerstone of the biosphere. This process, mastered by plants and algae, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment within chloroplasts, facilitates this transformation in the presence of sunlight. The subsequent release of oxygen enriches our atmosphere, a vital resource for all aerobic organisms. In a broader context, photosynthesis underpins the food chain, providing energy for countless life forms, from microscopic bacteria to towering trees, and ultimately sustaining the balance of our planet's ecosystems.
D1-978	We adapt an information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological and social modules to the problem of the global neuronal workspace, the current standard neuroscience picture of consciousness. Tunable punctuation emerges in a natural manner, suggesting the possibility of fitting appropriate phase transition power law, and, away from transition, generalized Onsager relation expressions, to observational data on conscious reaction. The development can be extended in a straightforward way to include the role of psychosocial stress, culture, or other embedding structured contexts in individual consciousness, producing a 'biopsychosocial' model that closely retains the flavor of the standard treatment, but better meets philosophical and other objections to brain-only descriptions.
D1-979	 Delving into the fascinating world of cellular communication, we encounter the intricate network of signaling pathways that regulate cell behavior. These pathways, orchestrated by a myriad of proteins, facilitate information transfer between cells, enabling coordinated responses to external stimuli and internal cues. One such pathway, the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) cascade, plays a pivotal role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Activation of this cascade initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events, propelling signaling molecules down the chain, ultimately modifying target proteins and dictating cellular outcomes. Unraveling the complexities of these signaling pathways offers profound insights into various biological processes, ranging from development to disease mechanisms, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies.
D1-980	Viral kinetics have been extensively studied in the past through the use of spatially homogeneous ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the diseased state. However, spatial characteristics such as localized populations of dead cells might adversely affect the spread of infection, similar to the manner in which a counter-fire can stop a forest fire from spreading. In order to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneities on viral spread, a simple 2-D cellular automaton (CA) model of a viral infection has been developed. In this initial phase of the investigation, the CA model is validated against clinical immunological data for uncomplicated influenza A infections. Our results will be shown and discussed.
D1-981	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the blueprint of life. A double helix structure, DNA stores and transmits genetic information essential for an organism's growth and development. Each strand of DNA is composed of nucleotides, with four base pairs - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - that pair in specific ways. Genes, segments of DNA, encode instructions for proteins, which carry out various functions within cells. Alterations in DNA, known as mutations, can lead to genetic disorders and diseases, underscoring DNA's crucial role in maintaining biological order. Understanding the intricacies of DNA and its interaction with genes paves the way for advancements in medicine, agriculture, and other fields, offering insights into the mysteries of life itself.
D1-982	By taking into account base-base stacking interactions we improve the Generalized Model of Polypeptide Chain (GMPC). Based on a one-dimensional Potts-like model with many-particle interactions, the GMPC describes the helix-coil transition in both polypeptides and polynucleotides. In the framework of the GMPC we show that correctly introduced nearest-neighbor stacking interactions against the background of hydrogen bonding lead to increased stability (melting temperature) and, unexpectedly, to decreased cooperativity (maximal correlation length). The increase in stability is explained as due to an additional stabilizing interaction (stacking) and the surprising decrease in cooperativity is seen as a result of mixing of contributions of hydrogen bonding and stacking.
D1-983	 Nitrogen fixation, a vital biochemical process, ensures the bioavailability of this essential nutrient for plant growth. Free-nitrogen, primarily in the form of atmospheric nitrogen (N2), is inert and unavailable for biological processes. Through a complex series of reductions, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, like Rhizobium and Azotobacter, convert N2 into ammonia (NH3). This ammonia then gets assimilated into organic compounds, like amino acids, within the bacteria and can be transferred to plants through root nodules. Legumes, such as peas and beans, have a mutualistic relationship with these nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility and promoting crop growth.
D1-984	In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged through several levels of compaction in an orderly retrievable way that enables the correct regulation of gene expression. The functional dynamics of this assembly involves the unwinding of the so-called 30 nm chromatin fiber and accordingly imposes strong topological constraints. We present a general method for computing both the twist and the writhe of any winding pattern. An explicit derivation is implemented for the chromatin fiber which provides the linking number of DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes. We show that there exists one and only one unwinding path which satisfies both topological and mechanical constraints that DNA has to deal with during condensation/decondensation processes.
D1-985	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, a crucial component is the DNA molecule, a double helix structure carrying the blueprint for life. Within this molecular ladder, segments called genes serve as instructions for the production of proteins. Each gene's expression can be influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, other genes, and epigenetic modifications. The intricate dance of genes and proteins forms the foundation for an organism's development, function, and response to its surroundings. Indeed, the study of genetics unveils the intricacies of life, offering profound insights into heredity, evolution, and disease.
D1-986	Recent developments in complex networks have paved the way to a series of important biological insights, such as the fact that many of the essential proteins of S. cerevisae corresponds to the so-called hubs of the respective protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the special importance of hubs, other types of nodes such as those corresponding to the network border, as well as the innermost nodes, also deserve special attention. This work reports on how the application of the concept of distance transform to networks showed that a great deal of the innermost nodes correspond to essential proteins, with interesting biological implications.
D1-987	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule at its core. This double helix, a testament to nature's ingenious design, carries the blueprint of life. Each strand, composed of nucleotides, is a sequence of four bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These base pairs form the rungs of the ladder, determining the genetic instructions that guide an organism's growth and development. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic disorders or evolutionary adaptations, highlighting the profound impact of DNA on life as we know it.
D1-988	We give an exposition of Plucker vectors for a system of joint axes in projective 3-space. We use Plucker vectors to analyse dependencies among joint axes, and in particular show that two rotational joints rigidly joined by a bar and each with 3 degrees of freedom always forms a 5-dimensional system. We introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective Lines, and argue that reduced redundancy in the axes of a body position increases injury risk. We apply this to a simple two-joint model of bowling in cricket, and show by analysis of some experimental data that reduced redundancy around ball release is observed in some cases.
D1-989	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) serves as the blueprint of life, encoding the instructions for an organism's development and function. Each DNA molecule, a double helix structure, is composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair in specific ways, forming the rungs of the helix. The sequence of these bases along the DNA strand is unique to each individual and determines their genetic makeup, influencing traits and susceptibility to certain diseases. Genetic variations, or mutations, can occur due to errors in DNA replication or exposure to environmental factors, leading to changes in an organism's characteristics. Understanding these genetic variations and their effects is crucial for advancing our knowledge of biology and medicine.
D1-990	The internal cell wall structure of the bacterium Lactobacillus helveticus has been observed in situ in aqueous solution using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The AFM tip was used not only for imaging but presumably to remove mechanically large patches of the outer cell wall after appropriate chemical treatment, which typically leaves the bacteria alive. The surface exposed after such a surgery revealed ca. 26 nm thick twisted strands within the cell wall. The structure and location of the observed strands are consistent with the glycan backbone of peptidoglycan fibers that give strength to the cell wall. The found structural organization of these fibers has not been observed previously.
D1-991	 In the dynamic world of biology, photographsynthesis stands as a vital process, a symphony of life itself. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is a testament to nature's efficiency, providing sustenance and breathable air for countless organisms. Photosynthesis is not merely a solitary event. it intertwines with other biological processes, such as respiration and nutrient cycling, maintaining the intricate balance essential for life on Earth. This remarkable, continuous exchange of energy and matter underscores the interconnectedness of life and the delicate harmony between organisms and their environment.
D1-992	Recent studies of in vitro evolution of DNA via protein binding indicate that the evolution behavior is qualitatively different in different parameter regimes. I here present a general theory that is valid for a wide range of parameters, and which reproduces and extends previous results. Specifically, the mean-field theory of a general translation-invariant model can be reduced to the basic diffusion equation with a dynamic boundary condition. The simple analytical form yields both quantitatively accurate predictions and valuable insight into the principles involved. In particular, I introduce a cutoff criterion for finite populations that illustrates both of these qualities.
D1-993	 In the thriving world of genetics, a captivating realm unfolds. DNA, the genetic instruction manual, meticulously encodes life's blueprint. From the smallest bacterium to the towering redwood, every organism shares this common thread. Genes, segments of DNA, dictate traits, functions, and growth patterns. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to diversity or disease, shaping evolution's intricate tapestry. The exploration of genomes, once thought complex beyond comprehension, is now within our grasp, promising breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and our understanding of life itself. This genetic voyage, a testament to human curiosity and tenacity, continues to reveal the uncharted depths of our biological world.
D1-994	"We propose and test a pair potential that is accurate at all relevant distances and simple enough for use in large-scale computer simulations. A combination of the Rydberg potential from spectroscopy and the London inverse-sixth-power energy, the proposed form fits spectroscopically determined potentials better than the Morse, Varnshi, and Hulburt-Hirschfelder potentials and much better than the Lennard-Jones and harmonic potentials. At long distances, it goes smoothly to the correct London force appropriate for gases and preserves van der Waals's ""continuity of the gas and liquid states,"" which is routinely violated by coefficients assigned to the Lennard-Jones 6-12 form."
D1-995	 In the vibrant world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a mesmerizing dance between life and sunlight. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen in this extraordinary process. Photosynthesis is the lifeblood of our planet, sustaining virtually all living organisms by providing the essential oxygen required for respiration. Moreover, it serves as a crucial carbon cycle regulator, converting carbon dioxide into organic carbon, thus mitigating the greenhouse effect. This symphony of life, driven by sunlight and carried out by chlorophyll, is a testament to nature's intricate design and the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-996	DNA looping participates in transcriptional regulation, for instance, by allowing distal binding sites to act synergistically. Here we study this process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with and without looping. Within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon, we show that regulation based on DNA looping, in addition to increasing the repression level, can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and, at the same time, decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins. Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate not only the average properties of transcription but also its fluctuations.
D1-997	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. An example is the relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, microscopic algae. Corals provide algae with a safe, sunlit environment, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. In return, algae produce oxygen and glucose, essential for the coral's growth and survival. This mutualistic relationship is crucial for the formation of coral reefs, the world's most diverse marine ecosystems. However, rising ocean temperatures threaten this delicate balance, leading to coral bleaching events and, eventually, the demise of these vital ecosystems. Understanding and preserving such symbiotic relationships is paramount in the quest to safeguard Earth's biodiversity.
D1-998	Finite size effects on the cooperative thermal denaturation of proteins are considered. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Omega, scales as N^zeta, where N is the number of amino acids. Surprisingly, we find that zeta is universal with zeta = 1 + gamma, where the exponent gamma characterizes the divergence of the susceptibility for a self-avoiding walk. Our lattice model simulations and experimental data are consistent with the theory. Our finding rationalizes the marginal stability of proteins and substantiates the earlier predictions that the efficient folding of two-state proteins requires the folding transition temperature to be close to the collapse temperature.
D1-999	 In the vibrant world of genetics, a single base pair alteration can significantly impact an organism's traits. Known as a mutation, these changes in DNA sequence can lead to diverse outcomes, from benign to devastating. For instance, a mutation in the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis production causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus, leading to the debilitating disease. Similarly, mutations in the gene encoding for hemoglobin result in sickle cell anemia, a condition marked by abnormal, crescent-shaped red blood cells. Conversely, mutations can also confer advantages, such as resistance to diseases, as seen in the malaria-resistant sickle cells in individuals from malaria-endemic regions. Thus, while mutations often carry detrimental effects, they are also the driving force behind evolution and diversity in life forms.
D1-1000	Sequence comparison across multiple organisms aids in the detection of regions under selection. However, resource limitations require a prioritization of genomes to be sequenced. This prioritization should be grounded in two considerations: the lineal scope encompassing the biological phenomena of interest, and the optimal species within that scope for detecting functional elements. We introduce a statistical framework for optimal species subset selection, based on maximizing power to detect conserved sites. In a study of vertebrate species, we show that the optimal species subset is not in general the most evolutionarily diverged subset. Our results suggest that marsupials are prime sequencing candidates.
D1-1001	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we discover DNA, the hereditary material within cells, crafting the blueprint for life. Each DNA molecule, a double helix, houses thousands of genes, the basic units of heredity. Genes, in turn, comprise segments called exons and introns. Exons encode the proteins that dictate an organism's traits, while introns serve as 'genetic spacers.' The process of transcription transcribes the DNA sequence into RNA, followed by translation, which converts the RNA sequence into a protein. This intricate dance of genes, RNA, and proteins underlies the complexity of life, shaping every aspect from growth to behavior.
D1-1002	Bone structure in mammals involves a complex network of channels (Havers and Volkmann channels) required to nourish the bone marrow cells. This work describes how three-dimensional reconstructions of such systems can be obtained and represented in terms of complex networks. Three important findings are reported: (i) the fact that the channel branching density resembles a power law implies the existence of distribution hubs. (ii) the conditional node degree density indicates a clear tendency of connection between nodes with degrees 2 and 4. and (iii) the application of the recently introduced concept of hierarchical clustering coefficient allows the identification of typical scales of channel redistribution. A series of important biological insights is drawn and discussed
D1-1003	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis emerges as a pivotal event. This process, conducted by the green pigment chlorophyll in plant cells, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This symphony of reactions supports life on Earth by creating the oxygen we breathe and generating food for plants. Photosynthesis, in essence, is a testament to nature's ceaseless endeavor to sustain itself, a cycle that has persisted for millions of years, fueling the survival and growth of countless organisms. This remarkable process is a constant reminder of the delicate balance that underpins life's tapestry.
D1-1004	A population of complete subgraphs or cliques in a network evolving via duplication-divergence is considered. We find that a number of cliques of each size scales linearly with the size of the network. We also derive a clique population distribution that is in perfect agreement with both the simulation results and the clique statistic of the protein-protein binding network of the fruit fly. In addition, we show that such features as fat-tail degree distribution, various rates of average degree growth and non-averaging, revealed recently for only the particular case of a completely asymmetric divergence, are present in a general case of arbitrary divergence.
D1-1005	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the blueprint of life. Within its intricate double helix, four nucleotides - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - pair up to encode the genetic instructions for every organism. The Human Genome Project, a monumental endeavor, successfully mapped the entire human genome, revealing approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes. Genetic mutations, alterations in DNA sequences, can lead to a myriad of health conditions, proving the profound impact of genetics on human biology. Such discoveries not only deepen our understanding of the human body but also open doors to innovative treatments and personalized medicine.
D1-1006	We extend replica exchange simulation in two ways, and apply our approaches to biomolecules. The first generalization permits exchange simulation between models of differing resolution -- i.e., between detailed and coarse-grained models. Such ``resolution exchange'' can be applied to molecular systems or spin systems. The second extension is to ``pseudo-exchange'' simulations, which require little CPU usage for most levels of the exchange ladder and also substantially reduces the need for overlap between levels. Pseudo exchanges can be used in either replica or resolution exchange simulations. We perform efficient, converged simulations of a 50-atom peptide to illustrate the new approaches.

D1-1008	This paper deals with a new model for clonal network dynamics. We describe in detail this model and derive special equations governing immune system dynamics based on the general gradient type principles that can be inherent to a wide class of real living objects. A special clonal network is modeled by two symmetric projector matrix variables simultaneously taking into account both asymmetry of the interaction to each other and adaptation states that can be realized owing to possible idiotypic clonal suppresions. We perform computer simulations of the model dynamics for some simple cases of relatively low dimension, paying special attention to the dynamics of amounts of activated receptor strings within clonal network.
D1-1009	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the captivating journey of DNA replication. This process, essential for the continuity of life, unfolds as the double helix separates, each strand serving as a template for a new one. Enzymes like helicase, topoisomerase, and primase initiate this separation and synthesis, meticulously unwinding the strands and laying the groundwork for replication. DNA polymerase then enters the scene, producing a new complementary strand, while proofreading ensures the fidelity of the genetic code. This remarkable dance of enzymes ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning the remarkable consistency and diversity of life on Earth.
D1-1010	This short technical paper advocates a bootstrapping algorithm from which we can form a statistically reliable opinion based on limited clinically observed data, regarding whether an osteo-hyperplasia could actually be a case of Ewing's osteosarcoma. The basic premise underlying our methodology is that a primary bone tumour, if it is indeed Erwing's osteosarcoma, cannot increase in volume beyond some critical limit without showing metastasis. We propose a statistical method to extrapolate such critical limit to primary tumour volume. Our model does not involve any physiological variables but rather is entirely based on time series observations of increase in primary tumour volume from the point of initial detection to the actual detection of metastases.
D1-1011	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis serves as nature's primary energy source, a harmonious process that transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen within green plant cells. This biochemical marvel occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which house the pigment chlorophyll, the true sun-absorbing champion. Through a complex series of reactions, photons from sunlight trigger a cascade of events, ultimately leading to the creation of ATP and NADPH, the energy currency and reducing power, respectively, fueling the synthesis of glucose. This remarkable conversion not only sustains the life of plants but also underpins the global carbon cycle, making photosynthesis an indispensable cornerstone in the Earth's ecological equilibrium.
D1-1012	We introduce and discuss a minimal individual-based model for influenza dynamics. The model takes into account the effects of specific immunization against viral strains, but also infectivity randomness and the presence of a short-lived strain transcending immunity recently suggested in the literature. We show by simulations that the resulting model exhibits substitution of viral strains along the years, but that their divergence remains bounded. We also show that dropping any of these features results in a drastically different behavior, leading either to the extinction of the disease, to the proliferation of the viral strains, or to their divergence.

This double-helix molecule, coiled within the nucleus of every cell, carries the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each DNA strand is a sequential arrangement of nucleotides, the building blocks of life. These nucleotides form genes, which encode the proteins essential for life processes. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, showcasing the intricate balance and importance of genetic information. This exploration of DNA and its role in heredity and evolution continues to fuel scientific inquiry, offering profound insights into the complexities of life.
D1-1014	We study two mechanisms for the formation of protein patterns near membranes of living cells by mathematical modelling. Self-assembly of protein domains by electrostatic lipid-protein interactions is contrasted with self-organization due to a nonequilibrium biochemical reaction cycle of proteins near the membrane. While both processes lead eventually to quite similar patterns, their evolution occurs on very different length and time scales. Self-assembly produces periodic protein patterns on a spatial scale below 0.1 micron in a few seconds followed by extremely slow coarsening, whereas self-organization results in a pattern wavelength comparable to the typical cell size of 100 micron within a few minutes suggesting different biological functions for the two processes.
D1-1015	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act, the green orchestra's grand symphony. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, transforming carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen in an exquisite chemical fusion. This process, orchestrated by chlorophyll within the green pigmented chloroplasts, fuels the life of organisms on Earth and forms the very essence of our planet's atmospheric balance. Photosynthesis is not merely a biological process. it is a testament to the astonishing power of nature, a silent, continuous performance that breathes life into our world.
D1-1016	Some microbes appear to be able to metabolize in glacial ice or permafrost. The rate depends on temperature, nutrient level, and bioelement availability, among other factors. I have developed a plausible argument that they do this while confined in veins filled with acidic or saline solution that provides nutrients and elements necessary for growth. Here I develop this scenario further and discuss some of its implications for ice-covered planetary bodies and for the the origin of life. An accompanying paper in the conference proceedings (Bay et al.) discusses plans to test this hypothesis using epifluorescence microscopy of pristine, unmelted ice samples and an optical biospectrologging tool to assay living and dead microbes in boreholes in glacial ice.

Mutations, alterations in the sequence of bases, can lead to genetic diseases or traits. Understanding DNA's structure and behavior offers insights into heredity, evolution, and potential for genetic engineering.
D1-1018	Most population models assume that individuals within a given population are identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Inhomogeneous models of populations and communities allow for birth and death rates to vary among individuals. recently, theorems of existence and asymptotic of solutions of such models were investigated. Here we develop another approach to modeling heterogeneous populations by reducing the model to the Cauchy problem for a special system of ODEs. As a result, the total population size and current distribution of the vector-parameter can be found in explicit analytical form or computed effectively. The developed approach is extended to the models of inhomogeneous communities.
D1-1019	 Delving into the intricacies of cellular metabolism, we find the intriguing process of glycolysis. This fundamental pathway, occurring in the cytoplasm, converts glucose into pyruvate, yielding a net gain of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules under anaerobic conditions. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondrial Krebs cycle, further fueling ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis's versatility is evident, as it can utilize various sugars and even certain non-sugar molecules, making it a crucial Player in cellular energy homeostasis.
D1-1020	Most population models assume that individuals within a given population are identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Here we develop a general approach to modeling heterogeneous populations with discrete evolutionary time step. The theory is applied to population dynamics of natural rotifer populations. We show that under particular conditions the behavior of the inhomogeneous model possesses complex transition regimes, which depends both on the mean and the variance of the initial parameter distribution and the final state of the population depends on the least possible value from the domain of the parameter. The question of persistence of the population is discussed.
D1-1021	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, a double helix structure carrying the blueprint of life. This hereditary material consists of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - that pair up in a specific sequence, encoding the instructions for an organism's growth and development. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic diseases or evolutionary adaptations. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insights into the mechanisms governing life, from the microscopic realm to the grand spectrum of biodiversity.
D1-1022	We introduce a Markov model for the evolution of a gene family along a phylogeny. The model includes parameters for the rates of horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and gene loss, in addition to branch lengths in the phylogeny. The likelihood for the changes in the size of a gene family across different organisms can be calculated in O(N+hM^2) time and O(N+M^2) space, where N is the number of organisms, $h$ is the height of the phylogeny, and M is the sum of family sizes. We apply the model to the evolution of gene content in Preoteobacteria using the gene families in the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database.

The dynamic interplay between DNA and proteins, regulated by complex molecular machinery, paints a breathtaking picture of life's intricate choreography.
D1-1024	It is increasingly evident that there is more to biological evolution than natural selection. moreover, the concept of evolution is not limited to biology. We propose an integrative framework for characterizing how entities evolve, in which evolution is viewed as a process of context-driven actualization of potential (CAP). Processes of change differ according to the degree of nondeterminism, and the degree to which they are sensitive to, internalize, and depend upon a particular context. The approach enables us to embed phenomena across disciplines into a broad conceptual framework. We give examples of insights into physics, biology, culture and cognition that derive from this unifying framework.
D1-1025	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the blueprint of life.

We find and classify all the stationary solutions of the model, as well as analytic approximations of them, both in the continuum and in the discrete limits. Our results explain the structure of the solutions reported by Theodorakopoulos {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 258101 (2004)] and provide a way to proceed to the analysis of the generalized version of the model incorporating the genetic information.
D1-1027	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we find the intricate dance of DNA, the blueprint of life. Each strand, a complex coded sequence, holds the key to an organism's traits. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic diversity, driving evolution. Genes, segments of DNA, carry these coded instructions. They are the building blocks of proteins, essential for growth, function, and survival. Epigenetics, a relatively new field, explores changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself, adding another layer of complexity to this grand biology puzzle.
D1-1028	In order to elucidate the role of the native state topology and the stability of subdomains in protein folding, we investigate free energy landscape of human lysozyme, which is composed of two subdomains, by Monte Carlo simulations. A realistic lattice model with Go-like interaction is used. We take the relative interaction strength (stability, in other word) of two subdomains as a variable parameter and study the folding process. A variety of folding process is observed and we obtained a phase diagram of folding in terms of temperature and the relative stability. Experimentally-observed diversity in folding process of c-type lysozimes is thus understood as a consequence of the difference in the relative stability of subdomains.

D1-1030	Fuzzy cognitive mapping was used to understand the wants and desires of local people before resettlement. Variables that the affected people think will increase their welfare during and after dam construction were determined. Simulations were done with their cumulative social cognitive map to determine which policy options would most increase their welfare. The construction of roads, job opportunities, advance payment of condemnation value, and schools are central variables that had the most effect on increasing people's income and welfare. The synergistic effects of variables demonstrated that the implementation of different policies not only add cumulatively to the people's welfare but also have an increased effect.
D1-1031	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, executed by green plants and some microorganisms, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The process unfolds in chloroplasts, specialized organelles, through a series of complex reactions. Light energy is harnessed, driving the separation of water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose, a simple sugar, serves as an essential energy source for the organism, while the oxygen is vital for respiration in most other life forms. Photosynthesis, thus, underpins the oxygen cycle, a crucial aspect of our planet's atmospheric balance. It not only sustains life on Earth but also contributes significantly to the carbon dioxide regulation that mitigates climate change.
D1-1032	We apply a recently developed adaptive algorithm that systematically improves the efficiency of parallel tempering or replica exchange methods in the numerical simulation of small proteins. Feedback iterations allow us to identify an optimal set of temperatures/replicas which are found to concentrate at the bottlenecks of the simulations. A measure of convergence for the equilibration of the parallel tempering algorithm is discussed. We test our algorithm by simulating the 36-residue villin headpiece sub-domain HP-36 wherewe find a lowest-energy configuration with a root-mean-square-deviation of less than 4 Angstroem to the experimentally determined structure.

Understanding these genetic codes enhances our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent a multitude of medical conditions, ultimately improving the quality of life.
D1-1034	A chemical kinetic model of the elongation dynamics of RNA polymerase along a DNA sequence is introduced. The proposed model governs the discrete movement of the RNA polymerase along a DNA template, with no consideration given to elastic effects. The model's novel concept is a ``look-ahead'' feature, in which nucleotides bind reversibly to the DNA prior to being incorporated covalently into the nascent RNA chain. Results are presented for specific DNA sequences that have been used in single-molecule experiments of the random walk of RNA polymerase along DNA. By replicating the data analysis algorithm from the experimental procedure, the model produces velocity histograms, enabling direct comparison with these published results.
D1-1035	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a pivotal, harmonious relationship between different biological organisms. This alliance, far from a mere coexistence, often benefits all parties involved. For instance, the lichen, a composite organism, is the result of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. The fungi provide the lichen with essential nutrients, while the algae photosynthesize, converting sunlight into energy, thereby nourishing both. Symbiosis, thus, underscores the interconnectedness of life, offering valuable insights into the delicate balance that sustains our biodiversity.
D1-1036	We provide a mean-field analysis of community structure of social and biological networks assuming that actors are able to evaluate some tree-derived distance to the other actors and tend to aggregate with the less distant. We show that such networks have small components, and give exact descriptions for the probability distribution of a typical community size and the number of communities. In particular, we show that the probability distribution of the community size is well-approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent two. We illustrate the robustness of the mean-field analysis by comparing its predictions on previously studied social networks and biological data.

Mutations, alterations in the sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, showcasing the importance of DNA's precise organization. In the realm of evolution, these variations contribute to the diversity of life forms, a testament to DNA's profound influence on the survival and adaptation of species.
D1-1038	A stochastic model for the activation of T-cells is analysed. T-cells are part of the immune system and recognize foreign antigens against a background of the body's own molecules. The model under consideration is a slight generalization of a model introduced by Van den Berg, Rand and Burroughs in 2001, and is capable of explaining how this recognition works on the basis of rare stochastic events. With the help of a refined large deviation theorem and numerical evaluation it is shown that, for a wide range of parameters, T-cells can distinguish reliably between foreign antigens and self-antigens.

The derivation of accurate such PDEs starting from finer scale, atomistic models, and using suitable averaging, is often a challenging task. approximate PDEs are typically obtained through mathematical closure procedures (e.g. mean-field approximations). In this paper, we show how such approximate macroscopic PDEs can be exploited in constructing preconditioners to accelerate stochastic simulations for spatially distributed particle-based process models. We illustrate how such preconditioning can improve the convergence of equation-free coarse-grained methods based on coarse timesteppers. Our model problem is a stochastic reaction-diffusion model capable of exhibiting Turing instabilities.
D1-1041	 Nitrogen fixation, a crucial biological process, converts atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. This transformation is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria, such as Rhizobia and Frankia, residing within root nodules of legumes and non-legume hosts, respectively. The process requires substantial energy input and is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase, which splits nitrogen molecules into ammonia. This ammonia is then assimilated into organic compounds, enriching the soil and promoting plant growth. Additionally, nitrogen fixation plays a vital role in the nitrogen cycle, ensuring a sustainable supply of this essential nutrient for life on Earth.
D1-1042	We study coarse-grained (group-level) alignment dynamics of individual-based animal group models for {\it heterogeneous} populations consisting of informed (on preferred directions) and uninformed individuals. The orientation of each individual is characterized by an angle, whose dynamics are nonlinearly coupled with those of all the other individuals, with an explicit dependence on the difference between the individual's orientation and the instantaneous average direction. Choosing convenient coarse-grained variables (suggested by uncertainty quantification methods) that account for rapidly developing correlations during initial transients, we perform efficient computations of coarse-grained steady states and their bifurcation analysis. We circumvent the derivation of coarse-grained governing equations, following an equation-free computational approach.

D1-1044	The distribution of bubble lengths in double-stranded DNA is presented for segments of varying guanine-cytosine (GC) content, obtained with Monte Carlo simulations using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model at 310 K. An analytical description of the obtained distribution in the whole regime investigated, i.e., up to bubble widths of the order of tens of nanometers, is available. We find that the decay lengths and characteristic exponents of this distribution show two distinct regimes as a function of GC content. The observed distribution is attributed to the anharmonic interactions within base pairs. The results are discussed in the framework of the Poland-Scheraga and the Peyrard-Bishop (with linear instead of nonlinear stacking interaction) models.

This process, essential for our atmosphere's oxygen levels, also fuels the growth of plants, enabling them to thrive and form the basis of countless food chains. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a cornerstone of life on Earth, binding us all in a shared, verdant tapestry of existence.
D1-1046	During each ovarian cycle, only a definite number of follicles ovulate, while the others undergo a degeneration process called atresia. We have designed a multi-scale mathematical model where ovulation and atresia result from a hormonal controlled selection process. A 2D-conservation law describes the age and maturity structuration of the follicular cell population. In this paper, we focus on the operating mode of the control, through the study of the characteristics of the conservation law. We describe in particular the set of microscopic initial conditions leading to the macroscopic phenomenon of either ovulation or atresia, in the framework of backwards reachable sets theory.

Genetic variation, resulting from mutations or recombination during reproduction, underpins evolution, shaping the diversity of life on Earth.
D1-1048	It is often useful in multivariate time series analysis to determine statistical causal relations between different time series. Granger causality is a fundamental measure for this purpose. Yet the traditional pairwise approach to Granger causality analysis may not clearly distinguish between direct causal influences from one time series to another and indirect ones acting through a third time series. In order to differentiate direct from indirect Granger causality, a conditional Granger causality measure in the frequency domain is derived based on a partition matrix technique. Simulations and an application to neural field potential time series are demonstrated to validate the method.
D1-1049	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. It's a double helix structure, a complex dance of nucleotides that encodes the instructions for an organism's development and functions. The DNA sequence varies among individuals, shaping our unique characteristics. Genes, segments of DNA, are the fundamental units of heredity, passing down traits from parents to offspring. These genes interact in a myriad of ways, creating the complex tapestry of life. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the delicate balance in our genetic code. Understanding this code offers invaluable insights into disease prevention, treatment, and the very essence of what makes us human.
D1-1050	Dynamics of a social population is analyzed taking into account some physical constraints on individual behavior and decision making abilities. The model, based on Evolutionary Game Theory, predicts that a population has to pass through a series of different games, e.g as a consequence of environmental fluctuations, in order to develop social cooperation and communication skills. It differs from the general assumption that evolution of cooperation, the so called Cooperation Paradox, can be explained by a single set of rules for intra-population competitions. The developed methods, potentially, have a practical value for some learning optimization problems in multiagent, e.g. corporate, environment.
D1-1051	 Delving into molecular biology, we unravel the intricate dance of life at its most fundamental level. Within the nucleus of a cell, DNA - the building block of genes - orchestrates the reproduction and expression of proteins, the workhorses of cellular function. Each strand of DNA contains a unique combination of genes, shaping the cell's destiny and the organism's overall characteristics. Enzymes, the protein catalysts, expedite these biological processes, ensuring the cell can perform its specific tasks efficiently. The RNA molecule, a close relative of DNA, plays a crucial role in translation, the process of decoding the genetic information stored in DNA, ultimately leading to the synthesis of proteins. This intricate dance of DNA, RNA, and proteins forms the basis of all life, underpinning the complex interplay of genetics and biology.
D1-1052	We apply the methods of optimal experimental design to a differential equation model for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, trafficking, and down-regulation. The model incorporates the role of a recently discovered protein complex made up of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl, the guanine exchange factor (GEF), Cool-1 (Beta-Pix), and the Rho family G protein Cdc42. The complex has been suggested to be important in disrupting receptor down-regulation. We demonstrate that the model interactions can accurately reproduce the experimental observations, that they can be used to make predictions with accompanying uncertainties, and that we can apply ideas of optimal experimental design to suggest new experiments that reduce the uncertainty on unmeasurable components of the system.
D1-1053	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves confronted by the fascinating realm of DNA replication. This process, essential for life, involves an astonishingly accurate copying of the DNA molecule, ensuring the transfer of genetic information from parent to offspring. The double helix structure unravels, with hydrogen bonds breaking between base pairs. Each strand then serves as a template for a new complementary strand, nucleotides linking together based on the principle of 'A pairs with T, and C pairs with G.' This intricate dance of molecules, orchestrated within the cell, underpins the preservation and propagation of life, a testament to nature's intricate design.
D1-1054	A mathematical theory on flocking serves the foundation for several ubiquitous multi-agent phenomena in biology, ecology, sensor networks, economy, as well as social behavior like language emergence and evolution. Directly inspired by the recent fundamental works of Cucker and Smale on the construction and analysis of a generic flocking model, we study the emergent behavior of Cucker-Smale flocking under hierarchical leadership. The rates of convergence towards asymptotically coherent group patterns in different scenarios are established.   The consistent convergence towards coherent patterns may well reveal the advantages and necessities of having leaders and leadership in a complex (biological, technological, economic, or social) system with sufficient intelligence.
D1-1055	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, sustaining virtually all life on Earth. This biochemical reaction, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The process unfolds in the chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells, where light energy is captured and transformed into chemical energy. This energy-rich glucose fuels plant growth, while the oxygen released into the atmosphere supports the respiration of other organisms, creating a symbiotic relationship that underpins our planet's biosphere. Photosynthesis, therefore, serves as the foundation of Earth's carbon cycle and oxygen atmosphere, a testament to the wonders of biological processes in maintaining the delicate balance of life.
D1-1056	We consider communication when there is no agreement about symbols and meanings. We treat it within the framework of reinforcement learning. We apply different reinforcement learning models in our studies and simplify the problem as much as possible. We show that the modelling of the other agent is insufficient in the simplest possible case, unless the intentions can also be modelled. The model of the agent and its intentions enable quick agreements about symbol-meaning association. We show that when both agents assume an `intention model' about the other agent then the symbol-meaning association process can be spoiled and symbol meaning association may become hard.
D1-1057	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves captivated by the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each nucleotide, a combination of a base, sugar, and phosphate, forms a rung on the ladder of life, with the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine pairing to form the steps. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic variations, shaping the diversity of life forms on Earth. Understanding the language of DNA is crucial in addressing various biological questions, from understanding inherited traits to combating diseases.
D1-1058	The human genotope is the convex hull of all allele frequency vectors that can be obtained from the genotypes present in the human population. In this paper we take a few initial steps towards a description of this object, which may be fundamental for future population based genetics studies. Here we use data from the HapMap Project, restricted to two ENCODE regions, to study a subpolytope of the human genotope. We study three different approaches for obtaining informative low-dimensional projections of this subpolytope. The projections are specified by projection onto few tag SNPs, principal component analysis, and archetypal analysis. We describe the application of our geometric approach to identifying structure in populations based on single nucleotide polymorphisms.
D1-1059	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the intriguing concept of epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequence alterations. Epigenetic changes do not affect the actual DNA sequence but instead modify how genes are read, essentially switching genes on or off. These modifications, often influenced by environmental factors, can be passed down from one generation to another, providing a bridge between nature and nurture. This dynamic process plays a crucial role in development, aging, and disease susceptibility, opening new avenues for understanding and treating various health conditions. The understanding of epigenetics is rapidly evolving, offering promising possibilities for personalized medicine and disease prevention strategies.
D1-1060	Protein splicing is a post-translational autocatalystic excision of internal protein sequence (intein) with the subsequent ligation of the flanking polypeptides (exteins). The high specificity of excision ensured by intein makes it possible to use a phenomenon of protein splicing for the biotechnology purposes. The aim of this work was optimization of obtaining and purification of the recombinant human growth hormone using the protein splicing. It was experimentally demonstrated that the use of modified intein as auto-removal affine marker makes it possible to perform the rapid and cheap isolation of the recombinant protein Hgh. Furthermore, this approach allows to obtain the human growth hormone with native N-terminus, without formyl-metionine. Key words: intein, human growth hormone, protein splicing
D1-1061	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet. Green choreographers, the plants, perform this act, harnessing sunlight's energy. They absorb carbon dioxide and water, converting these into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symphony of elements sustains countless other life forms, creating a harmonious ecosystem. Photosynthesis is not just a process. it is a testament to the resilience of life, a beacon of survival amidst the ever-changing landscape of our world. It's a silent yet powerful performance, a testament to the intricate web of life, a continuous symphony of growth and renewal.
D1-1062	The linear instability of Lotka-Volterra orbits in the homogenous manifold of a two-patch system is analyzed. The origin of these orbits instability in the absence of prey migration is revealed to be the dependence of the angular velocity on the azimuthal angle. in particular, the system desynchronizes at the exit from the slow part of the trajectory. Using this insight, an analogous model of a two coupled oscillator is presented and shown to yield the same type of linear instability. This unables one to incorporate the linear instability within a recently presented general framework that allows for comparison of all known stabilization mechanisms and for simple classification of observed oscillations.
D1-1063	 In the vibrant world of biology, photosynthesis, the process by which plants and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This intricate dance of life involves the green pigment chlorophyll, absorbed by sunlight, which splits water molecules and initiates a series of reactions that convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This glucose serves as the primary means of energy for the organism, while oxygen, a byproduct, is released back into the environment, supporting countless other life forms. Photosynthesis, thus, is a fundamental biological process, underpinning the intricate web of life on Earth.
D1-1064	"Boolean networks with canalizing functions are used to model gene regulatory networks. In order to learn how such networks may behave under evolutionary forces, we simulate the evolution of a single Boolean network by means of an adaptive walk, which allows us to explore the fitness landscape. Mutations change the connections and the functions of the nodes. Our fitness criterion is the robustness of the dynamical attractors against small perturbations. We find that with this fitness criterion the global maximum is always reached and that there is a huge neutral space of 100% fitness. Furthermore, in spite of having such a high degree of robustness, the evolved networks still share many features with ""chaotic"" networks."
D1-1065	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, DNA is the blueprint of life, a spiraling double helix harboring the coded instructions for every living organism. Each DNA molecule consists of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - which pair up in specific sequences to form genes. These genes serve as the foundation for protein synthesis, the process that builds the intricate structures essential for cellular function. Genetic variation, the shuffling of these base pairs, underpins the diversity of life, from the tiniest bacterium to the most magnificent elephant. Understanding this genetic language offers invaluable insights into evolution, disease, and the beauty of biological complexity.
D1-1066	The Darwinian paradigm of biological evolution is based on the separability of the variation and selection processes. As a result, the population thinking had always been an integral part of the Darwinian approach. I propose an alternative scheme of biological adaptation. It is based on appreciation of limits of what we can observe considering an individual biological object. This leads to a possibility for the adaptation process to occur on the level of a single object, as a 'selection among virtual states of the organism'. I discuss the application of this idea to the phenomenon of adaptive mutations in bacteria.
D1-1067	 In the vibrant tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pillar, the symphony's conductor. Chlorophyll, the verdant maestro, orchestrates this biochemical dance within plant cells. Using sunlight as its energy source, it splits water molecules, harnessing their hidden hydrogen and oxygen. Carbon dioxide, the silent collaborator, is merged with this energy to form glucose, a simple sugar. Oxygen, the byproduct, is released, sustaining life beyond plants. This process, a testament to nature's intricate design, fuels the food chain, underpins our atmosphere, and ultimately, enables the survival of countless species on Earth.
D1-1068	Biological information processing as implemented by regulatory and signaling networks in living cells requires sufficient specificity of molecular interaction to distinguish signals from one another, but much of regulation and signaling involves somewhat fuzzy and promiscuous recognition of molecular sequences and structures, which can leave systems vulnerable to crosstalk. This paper examines a simple computational model of protein-protein interactions which reveals both a sharp onset of crosstalk and a fragmentation of the neutral network of viable solutions as more proteins compete for regions of sequence space, revealing intrinsic limits to reliable signaling in the face of promiscuity. These results suggest connections to both phase transitions in constraint satisfaction problems and coding theory bounds on the size of communication codes.
D1-1069	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis unfolds as a captivating dance between species. This harmonious relationship, often seen in coral and algae, or in the gut of mammals, proves that nature promotes not just competition, but cooperation as well. Symbiosis can be mutual, with both partners benefiting – as in the case of clownfish and sea anemones, where the fish find protection, while the anemone receives nutrients from the fish's waste. Other instances reveal a more parasitic relationship, where one organism derives benefits while the other is negatively impacted. Regardless of the form, symbiosis offers a compelling testament to the resilience and adaptability of life, demonstrating that survival is not always a solitary pursuit, but can also be a shared journey.
D1-1070	We investigate the dynamics of an idealized model of microtubule growth that evolves by: (i) attachment of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) at rate lambda, (ii) conversion of GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) at rate 1, and (iii) detachment of GDP at rate mu. As a function of these rates, a microtubule can grow steadily or its length can fluctuate wildly. For mu=0, we find the exact tubule and GTP cap length distributions, and power-law length distributions of GTP and GDP islands. For mu=infinity, we argue that the time between catastrophes, where the microtubule shrinks to zero length, scales as exp(lambda). We also find the phase boundary between a growing and shrinking microtubule.
D1-1071	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, carries the genetic instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and function. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can occur due to various factors, including errors during replication, exposure to radiation, and chemical mutagens. These alterations can lead to genetic disorders, cancer, or adaptive advantages in evolution. Understanding DNA and its mutations offers insights into heredity, evolution, and potential for genetic therapies, revolutionizing our understanding and manipulation of life.
D1-1072	In this paper we consider the evolution of the HIV infection under a highly effective treatment based on a combination of RTI and/or PI drugs. This is usually modelled with a set of ODEs where the drug efficacy is a constant. In this paper we consider the treatment efficacy as a dynamic variable which evolves during the treatment. To model the dynamics of the drug efficacy we use an evolutive type assumption. The resulting set of ODEs are able to reproduce the typical pattern of the illness evolution under treatment: a period of remission, which can last several years, followed by a progressive recrudescence and a viral rebound.
D1-1073	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is a long, double-stranded helix, composed of nucleotides - the building blocks of life. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. Adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine are the four bases that link together to form the DNA sequence, unique to every organism. This sequence determines an organism's characteristics, from eye color to hair texture, passing down the generations through the process of cell division. Understanding DNA and its sequences opens a myriad of possibilities for genetic research, potentially revolutionizing medicine, agriculture, and even our understanding of evolution.
D1-1074	We show that in the dissipative quantum model of brain the time-dependence of the frequencies of the electrical dipole wave quanta leads to the dynamical organization of the memories in space (i.e. to their localization in more or less diffused regions of the brain) and in time (i.e. to their longer or shorter life-time). The life-time and the localization in domains of the memory states also depend on internal parameters and on the number of links that the brain establishes with the external world. These results agree with the physiological observations of the dynamic formation of neural circuitry which grows as brain develops and relates to external world.
D1-1075	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, our biological blueprint. This double-helix molecule, coiled within the nucleus of every cell, governs our growth, development, and virtually every aspect of our biology. Each DNA strand is composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - which pair up to form the rungs of the ladder. The sequence of these bases creates a unique genetic code for every individual, determining our inherited traits and predispositions. This code is transcribed into messenger RNA, guiding protein synthesis, a process essential for the functioning of our cells. Indeed, DNA's profound influence on our lives is a testament to nature's intricate design.
D1-1076	It is a fascinating subject to explore how well we can understand the processes of life on the basis of fundamental laws of physics. It is emphasised that viewing biological processes as manipulation of information extracts their essential features. This information processing can be analysed using well-known methods of computer science. The lowest level of biological information processing, involving DNA and proteins, is the easiest one to link to physical properties. Physical underpinnings of the genetic information that could have led to the universal language of 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids are pointed out. Generalisations of Boolean logic, especially features of quantum dynamics, play a crucial role.
D1-1077	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we find ourselves exploring the intricate dance of DNA. This deoxyribonucleic acid, a complex molecule, serves as the blueprint for all living organisms. Each strand contains a unique sequence of genes, each gene holding a specific set of instructions for the organism's growth, development, and function. This genetic information is passed down from generation to generation, shaping the diversity we see in nature. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to new traits, sometimes advantageous, sometimes detrimental, contributing to evolution's continuous flow of change. The study of genetics not only unveils the mysteries of life but also holds the key to understanding and combating genetic diseases, improving agricultural productivity, and potentially paving the way for personalized medicine.
D1-1078	The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
D1-1079	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis, the process by which plants and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. It is an essential dance between carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, yielding glucose and releasing oxygen. This oxygen is indispensable to most life forms on Earth, being a crucial component of cellular respiration. Conversely, glucose serves as a primary energy source for these organisms, fueling growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Photosynthesis is not only a testament to nature's ingenuity but also an undeniable cornerstone of life's continuance on our planet.
D1-1080	We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.
D1-1081	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a fundamental process, the green pulse that sustains our world. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, a symphony of chemical reactions that powers life on Earth. This process not only nourishes these organisms but also feeds a myriad of others, creating a delicate web of interdependence. Photosynthesis's efficiency, however, is under constant pressure, from climate change altering light patterns to pollution disrupting the balance of necessary elements. Understanding and conserving this vital process is crucial for our planet's future.
D1-1082	We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
D1-1083	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, the blueprint of life. This double helix, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions for an organism's growth and development. Each segment of DNA, known as a gene, carries specific information that dictates a particular trait or function. The gene's instructions are decoded through a process called transcription, where RNA molecules are produced, and then translated into proteins during translation. These proteins, in turn, perform various roles within the cell, from structuring its components to catalyzing biochemical reactions. Thus, understanding DNA and its genes offers profound insights into the workings of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-1084	Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
D1-1085	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays an essential role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The process involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water, which are then transformed under the influence of chlorophyll and sunlight into glucose and oxygen as a byproduct. This vital cycle supports the survival of organisms on Earth, serving as the primary source of oxygen and food. Photosynthesis is a testament to nature's ingenuity, enabling life to flourish amidst the radiant energy of the sun.
D1-1086	We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten micrometers over the full field of view.
D1-1087	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the fascinating realm of DNA replication. This process, essential for life, ensures that every cell duplicates its genetic material accurately. Enzymes, such as helicases, unwind the double helix, while primases synthesize short RNA primer strands. DNA polymerases then add nucleotides complementary to the template strand, elongating the new strand. Proofreading enzymes correct errors, maintaining the integrity of the genetic code across generations. This intricate dance of enzymes ensures the survival and reproduction of all life forms, from microorganisms to humans.
D1-1088	We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
D1-1089	 In the vibrant world of genetics, a single gene mutation can profoundly impact an organism's development and survival. Such is the case with cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease affecting the respiratory and digestive systems. The faulty gene produces a protein that causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus, leading to recurrent infections, lung damage, and impaired nutrient absorption. Researchers are diligently working to understand this gene's intricacies, exploring potential treatments, and pursuing gene therapy to correct the mutation, offering new hope for those affected by this debilitating condition.
D1-1090	Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
D1-1091	 Delving into the complexities of molecular biology, we find ourselves exploring the intricate dance of DNA replication. This process, akin to a precise copy machine, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one cell generation to the next. Enzymes such as helicases, polymerases, and ligases meticulously unwind, synthesize, and seal new DNA strands, respectively. This intricate ballet of biomolecules safeguards the integrity of our genetic blueprint, underpinning the very essence of life.
D1-1092	"A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\""odinger equation for a semi-spheroidal potential well. Only the negative parity states of the $Z(z)$ component of the wave function are allowed, so that new magic numbers are obtained for oblate semi-spheroids, semi-sphere and prolate semi-spheroids. The semi-spherical magic numbers are identical with those obtained at the oblate spheroidal superdeformed shape: 2, 6, 14, 26, 44, 68, 100, 140, ... The superdeformed prolate magic numbers of the semi-spheroidal shape are identical with those obtained at the spherical shape of the spheroidal harmonic oscillator: 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112, 168 ..."
D1-1093	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. The double helix structure, a testament to nature's ingenuity, encodes the instructions for an organism's development and function. Each DNA molecule, a complex dance of nucleotides, carries the genetic information passed down from generations. Mutations, tiny alterations in this sequence, can lead to variations in traits, shaping evolution's intricate tapestry. Genetic engineering, a modern extension of this natural process, manipulates DNA to create desired traits, revolutionizing fields from agriculture to medicine. Yet, ethical considerations loom large, as humanity grapples with the potential consequences of tampering with the very essence of life.
D1-1094	Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.
D1-1095	 In botany, phenotypic plasticity refers to a plant's ability to produce different traits in response to varying environmental conditions, without altering its genetic makeup. For instance, a seedling may develop a robust root system in nutrient-rich soil, but produce slender roots in poor soil for efficient water absorption. This adaptability enhances survival rates, ensuring continuity in diverse ecosystems. Phenotypic plasticity, thus, plays a crucial role in a plant's ability to thrive under various environmental pressures.
D1-1096	The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.
D1-1097	 Unveiling the intricacies of genetics, DNA serves as the blueprint of life. It's a double helix structure, crafted from four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, intricately paired. This genetic code, encoded within, dictates the growth, development, and function of every living organism. Mutations, alterations in this code, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the importance of maintaining DNA integrity. The study of genetics, thus, provides profound insights into our biological heritage, evolution, and potential for innovation in medicine and agriculture.
D1-1098	This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.
D1-1099	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy into chemical energy. Through a complex interplay of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, glucose, and oxygen are produced. This vital cycle not only sustains plant life but also provides the primary source of energy for most organisms on Earth. Furthermore, photosynthesis is a critical contributor to our atmosphere, as it regulates the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels essential for respiration and climate control. This symphony of life, in its simplest form, encapsulates the essence of survival and harmony in the biosphere.
D1-1100	An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.
D1-1101	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical miracle unfolds within chloroplasts, the plant cell's photosynthetic factories. Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are the raw materials, transformed into glucose and oxygen through an intricate series of reactions. This process not only sustains the plant but also oxygenates our atmosphere, supporting the respiration of all aerobic organisms. It is a testament to nature's ingenious designs, a continuous cycle that underpins the survival and evolution of life on Earth.
D1-1102	Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.
D1-1103	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis weaves a compelling narrative. This harmonious coexistence of different species, where one benefits and the other neither suffers nor benefits, is a biological phenomenon of profound significance. One classic example is the relationship between coral polyps and algae, zooxanthellae. The algae reside within the coral's tissue, photosynthesizing and producing oxygen and nutrients that the coral requires. In return, the coral provides the algae with carbon dioxide, light, and a safe environment. This mutualistic relationship not only sustains the coral but also contributes to the health of the entire ocean ecosystem. Similarly, in the human body, bacteria in our gut aid digestion, producing vital nutrients while also helping to protect us from harmful pathogens. Symbiosis, in its myriad forms, underscores the interconnectedness of life on our planet.
D1-1104	The design, construction, and performance of a linear radio-frequency ion trap (RFQ) intended for use in the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) are described. EXO aims to detect the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to $^{136}$Ba. To suppress possible backgrounds EXO will complement the measurement of decay energy and, to some extent, topology of candidate events in a Xe filled detector with the identification of the daughter nucleus ($^{136}$Ba). The ion trap described here is capable of accepting, cooling, and confining individual Ba ions extracted from the site of the candidate double-beta decay event. A single trapped ion can then be identified, with a large signal-to-noise ratio, via laser spectroscopy.
D1-1105	 In the fascinating world of biology, the intricate dance of photosynthesis unfolds. Green-hued chloroplasts, housed within plant cells, serve as nature's solar panels. They absorb sunlight, converting it into potential energy through photophosphorylation. Carbon dioxide, drawn from the atmosphere, is then utilized in a process called the Calvin cycle. Here, carbon dioxide is transformed into glucose, a primary energy source for plants. This process not only sustains plant life but also forms the basis of our planet's oxygen cycle, a vital component of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, therefore, is an essential, interconnected, and continuous process that links the biosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere, maintaining the delicate balance that supports life.
D1-1106	"We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density.

We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion.

Equations for the expansion coefficients include cross-modal gain, which completely changes behavior of the amplified wave field. Analysis of two-mode amplification reveals new unusual features in characteristics of two-mode amplifier. Instead of unlimited growth of both modes for incoherent fields, one of the modes grows with no limit and suppresses the lower-power mode.

D1-1152	We describe a general framework for avoiding spurious eigenvalues -- unphysical unstable eigenvalues that often occur in hydrodynamic stability problems. In two example problems, we show that when system stability is analyzed numerically using {\em descriptor} notation, spurious eigenvalues are eliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for differential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints. We propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic constraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables in a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is approximated numerically. In contrast, the simple and easily generalizable descriptor framework simultaneously solves the differential equations and algebraic constraints and is well-suited to stability analysis in these systems.

At certain layer alignments volume reflection occurs from each layer and the resultant multiple volume reflection angle is correspondingly increased, along with the range of entrance angles over which ions undergo volume reflection. Another feature is that the range of entrance angles for which bent crystal channeling occurs is also increased in passing through several bent layers. The use of several bent crystal layers to produce multiple volume reflection provides an alternative approach to the design of a space shield or radiation protection at accelerators based on bent crystals.

Since at any finite t the such constrained proper time intervals are less than reqiured for crossing a horizon, general relativity predicts the gravitational freezing of proper times in stars with time-like or null geodesics everywhere. The time dilation stabilizes contracting massive stars by freezing, which is maximal but finite at the centre, and the surface is frozen near the gravitational radius. The frozen stars (frozars) slowly defrost due to emissions and external interactions, the internal phase transitions can initiate refreezing with bursts and explosions.

In practical situations, observational data may be available only at a given level, for example at the ground level. We uncover two fractal signatures of chaotic advection of aerosols under the action of gravity.

Up to 0.8% refractive index changes are achieved by optically exciting free carriers at 1720 nm and a pulse energy of 1.8 micro Joules. The cavity resonance is dynamically tracked by measuring reflectivity versus time delay with tunable laser pulses, and is found to shift by as much as 3.3 linewidths within a few picoseconds.

With the help of recursion relations derived from the self-similar structure, we obtain the exact solution of average path length, $\bar{d}_t$, for Apollonian networks. In contrast to the well-known numerical result $\bar{d}_t \propto (\ln N_t)^{3/4}$ [Phys. Rev.

For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.

There may potentially occur total shut down. The purpose of such an experiment is to search for influence from the future, that is, backward causation. Since LHC will produce particles of a mathematically new type of fundamental scalars, i.e., the Higgs particles, there is potentially a chance to find unseen effects, such as on influence going from future to past, which we suggest in the present paper.
D1-1273	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the fascinating concept of DNA methylation. This biochemical process, a cornerstone of epigenetics, modifies DNA without altering its sequence. By adding a methyl group to the cytosine base, it affects gene expression, often silencing it. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cellular differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation, and genomic imprinting. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are linked to diseases such as cancer, further highlighting its significance in biological regulation.
D1-1274	One of the most useful measures of cluster quality is the modularity of a partition, which measures the difference between the number of the edges joining vertices from the same cluster and the expected number of such edges in a random (unstructured) graph. In this paper we show that the problem of finding a partition maximizing the modularity of a given graph G can be reduced to a minimum weighted cut problem on a complete graph with the same vertices as G. We then show that the resulted minimum cut problem can be efficiently solved with existing software for graph partitioning and that our algorithm finds clusterings of a better quality and much faster than the existing clustering algorithms.

In the spirit of the Ewald method the problem is divided into a short range and long range part. The charge density responsible for the long range part is represented by plane waves in the periodic directions and by finite elements in the non-periodic direction.

D1-1278	We present a design improvement for a recently proposed type of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor that uses a cylindrical (lenticular) lenslet array. The improved sensor design uses optical binning and requires significantly fewer detector pixels than the corresponding conventional or cylindrical Shack-Hartmann sensor, and so detector readout noise causes less signal degradation. Additionally, detector readout time is significantly reduced, which reduces the latency for closed loop systems, and data processing requirements. We provide simple analytical noise considerations and Monte-Carlo simulations, and show that the optically binned Shack-Hartmann sensor can offer better performance than the conventional counterpart in most practical situations, and our design is particularly suited for use with astronomical adaptive optics systems.
D1-1279	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, the role of DNA cannot be overstated. This double-helix molecule, found in virtually every cell in a living organism, acts as the blueprint for life, encoding the instructions needed to develop, maintain, and reproduce an organism. Each DNA molecule is a unique combination of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - that form a sequence specific to each individual. These sequences, or genes, dictate the production of proteins, key components for structure, function, and regulation within cells. Furthermore, DNA provides the foundation for heredity, enabling traits to be passed down from parents to offspring. Thus, DNA's influence permeates every aspect of life, making it a central focus in biology and beyond.
D1-1280	This paper deals with the triggering mechanism of the boiling crisis, a transition from nucleate to film boiling. We observe the boiling crisis in pool saturated boiling experimentally at nearly critical pressure to take advantage of the slowness of the bubble growth and of the smallness of the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) that defines the transition point. Such experiments require the reduced gravity conditions. Close to the CHF, the slow growth of the individual dry spots and their subsequent fusion on the transparent heater are observed through the latter. As discussed in the paper, these observations are consistent with numerical results obtained with the vapor recoil model of the boiling crisis.

The emission intensity within distinct submicrometer segments of single nanotubes changes in discrete steps after exposure to acid, base, or diazonium reactants. The steps are uncorrelated in space and time, and reflect the quenching of mobile excitons at localized sites of reversible or irreversible chemical attack. Analysis of step amplitudes reveals an exciton diffusional range of about 90 nanometers, independent of nanotube structure. Each exciton visits approximately 104 atomic sites during its lifetime, providing highly efficient sensing of local chemical and physical perturbations.

In particular, by using the concept of ""local"" Hurst exponent, we point out how the behaviour of this parameter, usually considered as a benchmark for persistency/antipersistency recognition in time series, is largely time-scale dependent in the market context. These findings are a direct consequence of the intrinsic complexity of a system where trading strategies are scale-adaptive. Moreover, our analysis points out different regimes in the dynamical behaviour of the market indices under consideration."

This biochemical phenomenon, executed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy into chemical energy, synthesizing glucose and releasing oxygen. Photosynthesis unfolds in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent phase, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen, and ATP and NADPH are generated. These energy-rich compounds fuel the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose, fueling the growth and reproduction of the organism. This symphony of reactions sustains life on Earth, intertwining the destiny of plants and the atmosphere in a delicate balance.
D1-1286	In this article we study the effects of higher body excitations in the relativistic CC calculations for atoms and ions with one valence electron using Fock-space CCSD, CCSD(T) and its unitary variants. The present study demonstrates that CCSD(T) estimates the ionization potentials (IPs) and the valence electron removal energies quite accurately for alkali atoms and singly ionized alkaline earth ions, but yields unphysical energy levels for atoms and/or ions with partially filled sub-shell like C II. We further demonstrate that the higher body excitation effects can be incorporated more effectively through the unitary coupled cluster theory (UCC) compared to the CCSD(T) method.

This interdependent relationship, often seen in coral and algae, or in the gut of many animals, bolsters the overall survival and prosperity of both parties. For instance, coral and algae form a symbiotic union known as a coral reef. The algae photosynthesize, producing oxygen and food for the coral, while the coral provides the algae with shelter, nutrients, and carbon dioxide, enabling photosynthesis. The symbiotic relationship between species not only enhances the well-being of individual organisms but also contributes significantly to the health and balance of entire ecosystems. Such partnerships underscore the interconnectedness of life on Earth, reminding us that our individual existence is inseparable from the broader web of life.
D1-1288	The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Co$_n$ clusters ($n=2-$20) have been investigated using density functional theory within the pseudopotential plane wave method. An unusual hexagonal growth pattern has been observed in the intermediate size range, $n=15-$20. The cobalt atoms are ferromagnetically ordered and the calculated magnetic moments are found to be higher than that of corresponding hcp bulk value, which are in good agreement with the recent Stern-Gerlach experiments. The average coordination number is found to dominate over the average bond length to determine the effective hybridization and consequently the cluster magnetic moment.
D1-1289	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiotic relationships play a pivotal role. Consider the mutualistic union between coral and zooxanthellae algae. Corals provide the algae with a protected environment, while the algae, in return, photosynthesize, producing oxygen and organic compounds that nourish the coral. This harmonious alliance not only sustains the coral but also forms the basis of coral reefs, the bustling underwater cities teeming with biodiversity. Yet, this delicate balance is under threat due to climate change and ocean acidification. The survival of these symbiotic systems serves as a stark reminder of our interconnectedness with nature and the urgent need to protect and preserve these vital ecosystems.
D1-1290	The contributions of neutrons to hadronic signals from the DREAM calorimeter are measured by analyzing the time structure of these signals. The neutrons, which mainly originate from the evaporation stage of nuclear breakup in the hadronic shower development process, contribute through elastic scattering off protons in the plastic scintillating fibers which provide the $dE/dx$ information in this calorimeter. This contribution is characterized by an exponential tail in the pulse shape, with a time constant of $\sim 25$ ns. The relative contribution of neutrons to the signals increases with the distance from the shower axis. As expected, the neutrons do not contribute to the DREAM \v{C}erenkov signals.
D1-1291	 Nestled within the annals of biological evolution, symbiosis emerges as a captivating interplay of life forms. This intricate dance, often seen as mutualism, occurs when two distinct species coexist in a harmonious relationship, each deriving benefits that propel their survival. One famous example is the relationship between oxpeckers and rhinoceroses in the African savannah. The oxpecker feeds on parasites infesting the rhino's skin while the rhino provides a safe, stationary platform for them. This symbiotic bond, though seemingly peculiar, underlines the intricate web of life where cooperation and coevolution reign supreme.
D1-1292	We consider local leaders in random uncorrelated networks, i.e. nodes whose degree is higher or equal than the degree of all of their neighbors. An analytical expression is found for the probability of a node of degree $k$ to be a local leader. This quantity is shown to exhibit a transition from a situation where high degree nodes are local leaders to a situation where they are not when the tail of the degree distribution behaves like the power-law $\sim k^{-\gamma_c}$ with $\gamma_c=3$. Theoretical results are verified by computer simulations and the importance of finite-size effects is discussed.

This intricate web of cellular communication underpins all life processes, making it a critical area of study in the pursuit of understanding and manipulating life at its most essential level.
D1-1294	"We demonstrate a simple method to improve the Lewenstein model for the description of high-order harmonic generation (HHG). It is shown that HHG spectra can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and the photo-recombination cross sections, where the former can be extracted from the Lewenstein model. By replacing plane waves with scattering waves in the calculation of recombination matrix elements, we showed that the resulting HHG spectra agree well with those from solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The improved model can be used for quantitative calculations of high harmonics generated by molecules."

This network has attracted the attention of network researchers as it serves as an excellent example of the weighted networks, the link weight being defined as a measure of the volume of trade between two countries. In this paper we analyzed the international trade data for 53 years and studied in detail the variations of different network related quantities associated with the ITN. Our observation is that the ITN has also a scale invariant structure like many other real-world networks.

This long tuning range is achieved by simultaneously ramping the external cavity length with the laser injection current. The external cavity consists of a microscope cover slip mounted on piezoelectric actuators. In such a configuration the laser output pointing remains fixed, independent of its frequency. Using a diode with an output power of 5-7 mW, the laser linewidth was found to be smaller than 30 MHz. This cover slip cavity and feedforward laser current control system is simple, economical, robust, and easy to use for spectroscopy, as we demonstrate with lithium vapor and lithium atom beam experiments.

This article demonstrates that there is a correspondence between a resource-consumer chemostat ecosystem and the Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convective fluid system. The Lorenz dynamics of the RB system can be translated into an ecosystem dynamics. Not only is there a correspondence between the dynamical equations, also the physical interpretations show interesting analogies. By using this fluid-ecosystem analogy, we are able to derive the correct value of the size of convection rolls by competitive fitness arguments borrowed from ecology. We finally conjecture that the Lorenz dynamics can be extended to describe more complex convection patterns that resemble ecological predation.

D1-1302	The observation of dark-resonances in the two-electron atom barium and their influence on optical cooling is reported. In heavy alkali earth atoms, i.e. barium or radium, optical cooling can be achieved using n^1S_0-n^1P_1 transitions and optical repumping from the low lying n^1D_2 and n^3D_{1,2} states to which the atoms decay with a high branching ratio. The cooling and repumping transition have a common upper state. This leads to dark resonances and hence make optical cooling less inefficient. The experimental observations can be accurately modelled by the optical Bloch equations. Comparison with experimental results allows us to extract relevant parameters for effective laser cooling of barium.

Single ionization electrons generated in liquid xenon are detected in a thin gas layer during the 31-day background run of the ZEPLIN-II experiment, a two-phase xenon detector for WIMP dark matter searches. Both the pressure dependence and magnitude of the single-electron response are in agreement with previous measurements of electroluminescence yield in xenon. We discuss different photoionization processes as possible cause for the sample of single electrons studied in this work. This observation may have implications for the design and operation of future large-scale two-phase systems.

Here we introduce a time-discrete evolution equation for arbitrary closed polygons in 3-space that is a discretisation of the localised induction approximation of filament motion. This discretisation shares with its continuum limit the property that it is a completely integrable system. We apply this polygon evolution to a significant improvement of the numerical algorithms used in Computer Graphics.

Similarly, the valence shell radii and the covalent radii are shown to be linearly dependent on the bohr radii. One table of data and 5 figures have been provided here showing that all the above radii are sums of two lengths, one of which is a multiple of the bohr radius and the other, a positive or negative constant for each group of elements.

This vast genetic blueprint, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - is encased within the double helix structure of chromosomes. The order of these bases, or nucleotide sequence, determines the genetic code, acting as a digital language that cells read to manufacture proteins essential for life. Variations in this sequence, known as mutations, can lead to genetic disorders, while evolution hinges on these alterations over generations. DNA's intricate dance of replication, repair, and expression forms the foundation of life's diversity and complexity.
D1-1310	We study the United States Congress by constructing networks between Members of Congress based on the legislation that they cosponsor. Using the concept of modularity, we identify the community structure of Congressmen, as connected via sponsorship/cosponsorship of the same legislation, to investigate the collaborative communities of legislators in both chambers of Congress. This analysis yields an explicit and conceptually clear measure of political polarization, demonstrating a sharp increase in partisan polarization which preceded and then culminated in the 104th Congress (1995-1996), when Republicans took control of both chambers.

The active medium was a 2.5 cm long silicon sample that was pumped with 5ns pulses at 2.88 micron. The absence of the nonlinear losses which severely limit the performance of silicon Raman devices in the near infrared combined with unsurpassed crystal quality, high thermal conductivity render silicon a very attractive Raman medium. Such a technology can potentially extend silicon photonics application beyond data communication in the near infrared and into the mid infrared world of remote sensing, biochemical detection and laser medicine.

D1-1316	We derive the properties of polaritons in single-$\Lambda$ and double-$\Lambda$ media using a microscopic equation-of-motion technique. In each case, the polaritonic dispersion relation and composition arise from a matrix eigenvalue problem for arbitrary control field strengths. We show that the double-$\Lambda$ medium can be used to up- or down-convert single photons while preserving quantum coherence. The existence of a dark-state polariton protects this single-photon four-wave mixing effect against incoherent decay of the excited atomic states. The efficiency of this conversion is limited mainly by the sample size and the lifetime of the metastable state.

The simulations are targeted towards an experiment previously conducted at CalTech (Bellan, P. M. and J. F. Hansen, Phys. Plasmas, 5, 1991 (1998)) which aimed at simulating Solar prominence eruptions in the laboratory.

D1-1322	"We investigate Kerr-Newman black holes in which a rotating charged ring-shaped singularity induces a region which contains closed timelike curves (CTCs). Contrary to popular belief, it turns out that the time orientation of the CTC is opposite to the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere rotates. In this sense, CTCs ""counter-rotate"" against the rotating black hole. We have similar results for all spacetimes sufficiently familiar to us in which rotation induces CTCs. This motivates our conjecture that perhaps this counter-rotation is not an accidental oddity particular to Kerr-Newman spacetimes, but instead there may be a general and intuitively comprehensible reason for this."

A velocity operator is defined as the derivative with respect to s. Superposition of corresponding Eigenfunctions give Galilean law of addition of velocities. We have replaced the differential operator by the corresponding finite difference symmetric operator. We have shown that superposition of corresponding discrete Eigenfunctions give relativistic law of addition of velocities. A reciprocal symmetric number system is developed and with the help of this number system we have shown the relation between superposition and relativistic law of addition of velocities.
D1-1327	 In the realm of physics, gravity is a fundamental force that binds us to our planet and shapes the cosmos. It's the force that keeps our feet on the ground and planets in their orbits. But what exactly is gravity? It's a force that arises from the presence of mass. Two masses attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This concept was elegantly illustrated by Sir Isaac Newton with his law of universal gravitation. Yet, in the 20th century, Albert Einstein expanded our understanding of gravity with his theory of general relativity, revealing it as a curvature of space-time caused by the presence of mass. In essence, gravity is not just a force, but a shape-shifter of the fabric of the universe itself.
D1-1328	We report the statistical properties of three bus-transport networks (BTN) in three different cities of China. These networks are composed of a set of bus lines and stations serviced by these. Network properties, including the degree distribution, clustering and average path length are studied in different definitions of network topology. We explore scaling laws and correlations that may govern intrinsic features of such networks. Besides, we create a weighted network representation for BTN with lines mapped to nodes and number of common stations to weights between lines. In such a representation, the distributions of degree, strength and weight are investigated. A linear behavior between strength and degree s(k) ~ k is also observed.
D1-1329	 Harnessing the power of the sun has long been a fascinating pursuit within the realm of physics. Solar energy, a renewable and abundant resource, promises to revolutionize our energy consumption and mitigate environmental impact. Photovoltaic cells, a cornerstone technology, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are increasingly efficient, with modern designs capable of converting up to 25% of incident sunlight into usable energy. As research progresses, we anticipate even higher efficiencies, paving the way for a future where solar power becomes a dominant force in global energy production.
D1-1330	Superresolution, extraordinary transmission, total absorption, and localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing attention. These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are usually studied within the context of different, sometimes rather sophisticated, physical approaches. Remarkably, all these seemingly unrelated phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave interaction with an open resonator. Here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way, mapping each system onto a simple resonator model. Such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena, explains all the main features of their complex behaviour, and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters: eigenfrequencies, Q-factors, and coupling coefficients.
D1-1331	 In the realm of physics, gravity, an omnipresent force, governs the motion of celestial bodies. A force that keeps us rooted to Earth, yet allows the Moon to orbit and planets to revolve around the Sun. It's a force so intricate that it warps space-time itself, as demonstrated by Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Yet, gravity remains a mystery, with its exact nature still not fully understood. The quest to comprehend this force continues, driving scientists to explore the cosmos, unraveling its secrets, and expanding our understanding of the universe.
D1-1332	"The transformation converting equations invariant under Lorentz into the equations invariant under Galileo is obtained. On this basis: (1) the super-light electromagnetic wave with longitudinal and transversal modes is found out. (2) it is shown the wave velocity coincides with that of de Broglie's wave. (3) the connection between Maxwell's electrodynamics and Shredinger's equation is established. (4) structural elements of space are discovered and ""a horizon of visibility"" is found. It is shown Bell's inequalities and the principle of the light speed constancy are based on the SRT artifact and ""Einstein's local realism"" is determined by the wave referred above. Objectivity of results for quantum and classical objects is discussed"
D1-1333	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy transformation is a fundamental principle. Energy, in its diverse forms such as kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and more, can be converted from one form to another, but the total amount remains constant. For instance, when a ball rolls down a hill, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing it to accelerate. This phenomena, known as conservation of energy, underpins various natural processes and technological applications, from simple pendulums to complex electric generators. This principle, while elementary, opens the door to a deeper understanding of the universe's workings, fostering innovation and advancements in our quest to harness energy effectively.
D1-1334	High-order harmonic generation from atomic systems is considered in the crossed fields of a relativistically strong infrared laser and a weak attosecond-pulse train of soft x-rays. Due to one-photon ionization by the x-ray pulse, the ionized electron obtains a starting momentum that compensates the relativistic drift which is induced by the laser magnetic field, and allows the electron to efficiently emit harmonic radiation upon recombination with the atomic core in the relativistic regime. In this way, short pulses of coherent hard x-rays of up to 40 keV energy and 10 as duration can be brought about.
D1-1335	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy, a fundamental property of matter, unfolds an intriguing narrative. Energy, in its simplest form, is the capacity to do work or cause change. It permeates our universe, from the tiniest particle to the grandest galaxy. Energy can be transformed from one form to another, such as kinetic energy (energy of motion) to potential energy (energy of position). This transformation occurs through interactions, like when a ball rolls down a hill, converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. Such transformations are governed by the laws of conservation of energy, ensuring that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. This transformative dance of energy, invisible yet omnipresent, weaves the intricate fabric of our physical world.
D1-1336	An event reweighting technique incorporated in multivariate training algorithm has been developed and tested using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). The event reweighting training are compared to that of the conventional equal event weighting based on the ANN and the BDT performance. The comparison is performed in the context of the physics analysis of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which will explore the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces that shape our universe. We demonstrate that the event reweighting technique provides an unbiased method of multivariate training for event pattern recognition.
D1-1337	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic behavior of particles defies our classical understanding. For instance, the famous double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave-particle duality. Here, light or matter pass through two slits, creating an interference pattern on a screen, as if they were waves. Yet, when observed, these particles behave as individual particles, passing through only one slit. This paradoxical phenomenon, known as wave-particle duality, underscores the intricate and fascinating world of quantum mechanics, where reality seems to bend to the observer's presence.
D1-1338	The method of self-similar factor approximants is completed by defining the approximants of odd orders, constructed from the power series with the largest term of an odd power. It is shown that the method provides good approximations for transcendental functions. In some cases, just a few terms in a power series make it possible to reconstruct a transcendental function exactly. Numerical convergence of the factor approximants is checked for several examples. A special attention is paid to the possibility of extrapolating the behavior of functions, with arguments tending to infinity, from the related asymptotic series at small arguments. Applications of the method are thoroughly illustrated by the examples of several functions, nonlinear differential equations, and anharmonic models.
D1-1339	 Harnessing solar energy is a promising solution to our increasing energy demands and reducing carbon emissions. Photovoltaic cells, or solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity, making them an efficient and clean energy source. These cells are made primarily from silicon, which absorbs photons from sunlight, releasing electrons that generate an electric current. The efficiency of these cells can be improved through advanced materials and engineering techniques, such as nanotechnology and concentrator designs. As we continue to innovate and improve solar technology, the potential for solar energy to power our world becomes increasingly significant. The future of renewable energy lies in solar power, offering a sustainable and limitless energy source for generations to come.
D1-1340	By tracking small particles in the bulk of an intensely turbulent flow, we show that even a very small concentration of long-chain polymers disrupts the usual turbulent energy cascade. The polymers affect scales much larger than their physical size, from the dissipation range to the inertial range. The effect depends strongly on the polymer concentration. While the dissipative-scale statistics change continuously as the polymer concentration is increased, the inertial-range energy transfer rate is only altered by the polymer additives when the concentration is above a threshold (approximately 5 parts per million by weight for the polymer we used).
D1-1341	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies our everyday intuition. For instance, the famous double-slit experiment demonstrates that light and matter can exhibit wave-particle duality. Photons, once thought to be simple particles, can behave as waves, passing through both slits on a screen and interfering with themselves, creating an intricate pattern of light and darkness. This phenomenon, known as wave-particle duality, challenges our understanding of reality, suggesting that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This enigma, among many others, continues to captivate physicists and philosophers alike, offering a glimpse into the mystifying world of the very small.
D1-1342	We image spatial distributions of Xe$^{q+}$ ions in the focus of a laser beam of ultrashort, intense pulses in all three dimensions, with a resolution of $\sim$3 $\mu$m and $\sim$12 $\mu$m in the two transverse directions. This allows for studying ionization processes without spatially averaging ion yields. Our \emph{in situ} ion imaging is also useful to analyze focal intensity profiles and to investigate the transverse modal purity of tightly focused beams of complex light. As an example, the intensity profile of a Hermite-Gaussian beam mode HG$_{1,0}$ recorded with ions is found to be in good agreement with optical images.
D1-1343	 In the realm of quantum physics, the intriguing concept of superposition captivates many minds. It suggests that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, only revealing its actual state upon measurement. This counterintuitive phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of reality, where objects are either in one state or another. The wave-particle duality, another fundamental principle, reinforces this oddity, as it posits that every particle also exhibits wave-like properties. These principles, when combined, confound our intuition and offer a profound glimpse into the enigmatic quantum world, where particles can be in multiple places at the same time and where the act of observation alters reality itself.
D1-1344	The interface between classical physics and quantum physics is explained from the point of view of quantum information theory (Feynman Processes). The interpretation depends on a hefty sacrifice: the classical determinism or the arrow of time.   The wave-particle duality steams from the qubit model, as the root of creation and annihilation of possibilities. A few key experiments are briefly reviewed from the above perspective: quantum erasure, delayed-choice and wave-particle correlation.   The CPT-Theorem is interpreted in the framework of categories with duality and a timeless interpretation of the Feynman Processes is proposed. A connection between the fine-structure constant and algebraic number theory is suggested.
D1-1345	 In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of superposition stands out as a fascinating puzzle. It proposes that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, only resolving into a single definite state upon measurement. This defies our classical understanding of particles having distinct, specific locations. Furthermore, entanglement – a phenomenon where particles become interconnected, so that the state of one instantaneously affects the other, regardless of distance – adds another layer of complexity. These enigmatic principles challenge our perception of reality and continue to baffle scientists, offering a glimpse into the mysterious, subatomic world that governs our universe.
D1-1346	The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is one of the most popular games of the Game Theory due to the emergence of cooperation among competitive rational players. In this paper, we present the PD played in cells of one-dimension cellular automata, where the number of possible neighbors that each cell interacts, z, can vary. This makes possible to retrieve results obtained previously in regular lattices. Exhaustive exploration of the parameters space is presented. We show that the final state of the system is governed mainly by the number of neighbors z and there is a drastic difference if it is even or odd.
D1-1347	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy, specifically kinetic energy, plays a pivotal role. Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. It's calculated by the formula 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. This energy is directly proportional to the object's speed squared and mass, meaning heavier objects moving faster carry more kinetic energy. Understanding kinetic energy aids in predicting outcomes of collisions, studying motion, and even unraveling the behavior of stars and galaxies on cosmic scales. It's a fundamental concept bridging the microscopic world of particles and the macroscopic universe.
D1-1348	Urban streets patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and details-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggests that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follow a simple universal mechanism.
D1-1349	 In the realm of physics, the concept of gravity holds a profound place. Gravity, an invisible force, is responsible for the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the falling of an apple from a tree. It's a force that attracts two objects with mass, pulling them together. The strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and the distance separating them. Newton's law of universal gravitation, a foundational principle, describes this force. On a smaller scale, gravity affects everyday life, from the way we walk to the structure of buildings. Beyond our planet, it shapes the cosmos, governing the movements of celestial bodies. Gravity's influence is pervasive, a testament to its fundamental role in the universe.
D1-1350	A major source of delays in public transportation is the clustering instability, which causes late buses to become progressively later while the buses trailing it become progressively earlier. In this paper, we study this instability and how to neutralize it using the common practices of holding and schedule slack. Starting with an on-time route, we delay one or more buses at a single stop, and determine how these delays grow over time. We compare the effects of two different types of holding on the stability of the system, and briefly investigate how our results change with the use of timepoints.
D1-1351	 In the captivating realm of physics, gravity, an omnipresent force, governs the motion of celestial bodies and terrestrial objects alike. It's the silent sentinel that keeps our feet planted on the ground and pulls us towards the earth, while simultaneously holding the universe together. Yet, gravity is not just a force of attraction. it shapes the cosmos, driving stars to form within nebulae and propelling them across the vast expanse of space. Its effects can be felt in the gentle sway of a pendulum or the mighty dance of galaxies, making it a monumental player in the grand design of the universe.
D1-1352	The photoionization spectrum of an atom in a magnetic field is calculated by combining R-matrix propagation with local adiabatic basis expansions. This approach considerably increases the speed and the energy range over which calculations can be performed compared to previous methods, allowing one to obtain accurate partial and total cross sections over an extended energy range for an arbitrary magnetic field strength. In addition, the cross sections for all atoms of interest can be calculated simultaneously in a single calculation. Multichannel quantum defect theory allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance structure in the continuum. Calculated cross sections for a range of atoms in both laboratory and astrophysical field strengths are presented.
D1-1353	 In the realm of quantum physics, a fundamental concept is the wave-particle duality. This principle, first proposed by Louis de Broglie, suggests that every particle, from electrons to atoms, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This seemingly paradoxical idea is key to understanding phenomena such as diffraction and interference, which classically apply only to waves. It challenges our traditional understanding of matter, underscoring the intricate interplay between the microscopic world and the laws of physics that govern it. This duality, while complex, opens doors to a deeper understanding of the universe, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and sparking new questions about the nature of reality itself.
D1-1354	We present an overview of Dr. Penrose's model of a cyclic universe, minus the big crunch which relies upon black hole collection of matter after an a long term expansion phase from an initial big bang . We affirm that the suggested evolution equation presented at his lecture for his model meets requirements as to an emergent quintessence field from a vacuum state . We try to offer suggestions as to how to investigate his controversial conformal mapping of matter/energy via Hawkings radiation from a potentially infinite number of black holes to a new big bang. This is his 'ripples in a pond' effect which we find highly unusual but worth serious study and investigation.
D1-1355	 Harnessing the Power of Renewable Energy: Solar PhotovoltaicsSolar photovoltaics (PV) is a cutting-edge technology converting sunlight directly into electricity. This clean, renewable energy source offers a promising solution to combat the growing global energy demand and reduce carbon emissions. Solar PV panels, composed of semiconducting materials, generate electricity when sunlight strikes them, creating an electric field that causes electrons to flow.The simplicity of design, low maintenance requirements, and increasing efficiency of solar PV panels have made them an attractive choice for both residential and commercial applications. As the cost of solar PV technology continues to decline, it is expected that solar power will play a significant role in future energy markets, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly world.
D1-1356	The various plasma models - incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, compressible MHD model, incompressible Hall MHD model, compressible Hall MHD model, electron MHD model, compressible Hall MHD with electron inertia model - notwithstanding the diversity of the underlying physics, are shown to exhibit some common features in the Beltrami states like certain robustness with respect to the plasma compressibility effects (albeit in the barotropy assumption) and the {\it Bernoulli} condition. The Beltrami states for these models are deduced by minimizing the appropriate total energy while keeping the appropriate total helicity constant. A Hamiltonian formulation framework is used to carry out these variational problems.
D1-1357	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the intriguing phenomenon of superposition challenges our conventional understanding of reality. A single quantum particle, such as an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a concept known as a superposition state. This defies classical physics principles where objects can only occupy one state at a time. The act of observation collapses this superposition, revealing the particle in one specific state. This counterintuitive behavior underscores the profound differences between classical and quantum realms, offering a glimpse into the extraordinary world governed by quantum mechanics.
D1-1358	The maximum entropy principle can be used to assign utility values when only partial information is available about the decision maker's preferences. In order to obtain such utility values it is necessary to establish an analogy between probability and utility through the notion of a utility density function. According to some authors [Soofi (1990), Abbas (2006a) (2006b), Sandow et al. (2006), Friedman and Sandow (2006), Darooneh (2006)] the maximum entropy utility solution embeds a large family of utility functions. In this paper we explore the maximum entropy principle to estimate the utility function of a risk averse decision maker.
D1-1359	 Harnessing the power of renewable energy has become a global priority. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, a key player in this shift, converts sunlight directly into electricity. This clean, sustainable energy source relies on silicon-based solar cells, which absorb photons from sunlight and release electrons, creating an electric current. The efficiency of these cells is continually improving through advancements in materials science and engineering, making solar PV a promising solution for reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change. By investing in research and development, we can accelerate the transition to renewable energy, ensuring a greener, more sustainable future for generations to come.
D1-1360	"We introduce the innovative technologies, based on the concept of ""sensory substitution"", we are developing in the fields of biomedical engineering and human disability. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive biomedical and/or technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia). and (2) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper describes the architecture and the functioning principle of these biofeedback systems and presents preliminary results of two feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults."
D1-1361	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies conventional reasoning. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this, as particles appear to pass through two slits simultaneously, only to form an interference pattern on a screen. This puzzling phenomenon, known as wave-particle duality, suggests that these particles exist in multiple states at once until observed, a concept termed superposition. The mystery deepens with entanglement, where particles instantaneously affect each other, regardless of distance. These counterintuitive phenomena challenge our understanding of reality, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in the physical world.
D1-1362	In this paper we present a methodology to address the problem of brain tissue deformation referred to as 'brain-shift'. This deformation occurs throughout a neurosurgery intervention and strongly alters the accuracy of the neuronavigation systems used to date in clinical routine which rely solely on pre-operative patient imaging to locate the surgical target, such as a tumour or a functional area. After a general description of the framework of our intra-operative image-guided system, we describe a procedure to generate patient specific finite element meshes of the brain and propose a biomechanical model which can take into account tissue deformations and surgical procedures that modify the brain structure, like tumour or tissue resection.
D1-1363	 Unraveling the enigmatic realm of quantum physics, we delve into the microscopic world where particles exhibit bewildering behavior. Unlike classical physics, particles don't follow fixed trajectories. they exist in multiple places simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. This paradoxical state collapses into a definite position upon measurement, a principle encapsulated by the famous observer effect. Another intriguing facet is entanglement, where particles become instantaneously connected regardless of distance, defying the boundaries of space and time. Quantum physics challenges our conventional understanding of reality, suggesting a non-local, interconnected cosmos that continues to baffle and inspire.
D1-1364	Many structures in nature are invariant under the transformation (p,r)->(br,-p/b), where b is some scale factor. Born's reciprocity hypothesis affirms that this invariance extends to the entire Hamiltonian and equations of motion. We investigate this idea for atomic physics and galactic motion, where one is basically dealing with a 1/r potential and the observations are very accurate, so as to determine the scale $b = m\Omega$. We find that an $\Omega \sim 1.5\times 10^{-15}$ Hz has essentially no effect on atomic physics but might possibly offer an explanation for galactic rotation, without invoking dark matter.
D1-1365	 Gravity, the universal force that governs the motion of celestial bodies, exerts an incredible pull on Earth, shaping our planet's landscape and determining the tides. This force, caused by the attraction between two massive objects, is responsible for keeping us firmly grounded. Yet, it's not just about keeping things on the ground. gravity also propels rockets into space, venturing beyond Earth's atmosphere to explore the cosmos. Intriguingly, the same force that keeps us tethered to our home planet can stretch and distort space-time, according to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Indeed, gravity's influence extends far beyond our immediate surroundings, painting a picture of a vast, interconnected universe in perpetual motion.
D1-1366	In this work the physicochemical characterization of liposomes loaded with a newly synthesised carboranyl porphyrazine (H2HECASPz) is described. This molecule represents a potential drug for different anticancer therapies, such as Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Photodynamic Therapy and Photothermal Therapy. Different loading methods and different lipid mixtures were tested. The corresponding loaded vectors were studied by Small Angle Scattering (SANS and SAXS), light scattering and zeta potential. The combined analysis of structural data at various length scales and the measurement of the surface charge allowed to obtain a detailed characterization of the investigated systems. The mechanisms underlying the onset of differences in relevant physicochemical parameters (size, polydispersity and charge) were also critically discussed.
D1-1367	 In the realm of physics, electromagnetism stands out as a fascinating force that governs the behavior of charged particles. This intricate dance of electricity and magnetism is encapsulated in Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and change over time. One of the most profound implications of these equations is the prediction of electromagnetic waves, including light, which travel at a constant speed through a vacuum. This understanding of light as an electromagnetic wave has revolutionized our perception of the universe, enabling advancements in telecommunications, imaging, and our overall understanding of the cosmos. The interplay of electromagnetism with other fundamental forces continues to fuel scientific inquiry, promising a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.
D1-1368	A system of differential equations is proposed designed as to identify communities in weighted networks. The input is a symmetric connectivity matrix $A_{ij}$. A priori information on the number of communities is not needed. To verify the dynamics, we prepared sets of separate, fully connected clusters. In this case, the matrix $A$ has a block structure of zeros and units. A noise is introduced as positive random numbers added to zeros and subtracted from units. The task of the dynamics is to reproduce the initial block structure. In this test, the system outperforms the modularity algorithm, if the number of clusters is larger than four.
D1-1369	" In the realm of quantum mechanics, the intriguing concept of superposition challenges our understanding of reality. A quantum particle, such as an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. This defies classical physics, where an object can only occupy one state at a time. The act of observation collapses the superposition, forcing the particle to manifest in one state, a principle encapsulated by the famous quote, ""Observe the moon, and it is not a dancing butterfly."" The mysterious dance of superpositions in the microscopic world continues to fascinate physicists, offering insights into the very fabric of our universe."
D1-1370	We use particle image velocimetry to measure the sedimentation dynamics of a semi-dilute suspension of non-Brownian spheres at Reynolds numbers, $0.001\le Re\le 2.3$, extending from the Stokes to the moderately inertial regime. We find that the onset of inertial corrections to Stokes sedimentation occurs when the inertial screening length $l=a/Re$ becomes similar to the Stokes sedimentation length $\xi_0$, at $Re_c= a/\xi_0\approx 0.05$. For $Re>Re_c$, inertial screening significantly reduces both the magnitude and spatial extent of the particle velocity fluctuations. A modified Hinch force balance model connects the fluctuation magnitudes $\sigma_V/V$ to the correlation sizes $\xi$.
D1-1371	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy is a fundamental principle that underpins our understanding of the universe. Energy, in its simplest form, is the capacity to do work or to cause change. It exists in various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and nuclear. Kinetic energy, governing the motion of objects, is a direct result of mass in motion, while potential energy, such as gravitational potential energy, is stored energy waiting to be converted. Thermal energy, the energy of motion of particles in a substance, is what makes matter hot or cold. Electrical energy, harnessed for power generation, is the energy of moving electric charges. Lastly, nuclear energy, the most powerful form, is the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom, potentially released through fission or fusion. The interplay of these forms of energy, their conservation, and their transformation, continue to captivate and challenge physicists worldwide.
D1-1372	We propose a synthetical weights' dynamic mechanism for weighted networks which takes into account the influences of strengths of nodes, weights of links and incoming new vertices. Strength/Weight preferential strategies are used in these weights' dynamic mechanisms, which depict the evolving strategies of many real-world networks. We give insight analysis to the synthetical weights' dynamic mechanism and study how individual weights' dynamic strategies interact and cooperate with each other in the networks' evolving process. Power-law distributions of strength, degree and weight, nontrivial strength-degree correlation, clustering coefficients and assortativeness are found in the model with tunable parameters representing each model. Several homogenous functionalities of these independent weights' dynamic strategy are generalized and their synergy are studied.
D1-1373	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fascinating concept emerges: entanglement. Two particles, regardless of distance, can instantaneously influence each other, a phenomenon defying classical physics' causality. This mind-boggling connection is established through a shared quantum state. Measuring one particle's property instantaneously reveals the state of the other, even if separated by vast cosmic distances. This seemingly paradoxical behavior challenges our understanding of reality and has implications in the development of quantum computing and cryptography. Entanglement, a testament to the strange and intriguing realm of quantum mechanics, continues to baffle and intrigue scientists.
D1-1374	The mass and kinetic energy distribution of nuclear fragments from thermal neutron induced fission of 235U have been studied using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Besides reproducing the pronounced broadening on the standard deviation of the final fragment kinetic energy distribution $\sigma_{e}(m)$ around the mass number m = 109, our simulation also produces a second broadening around m = 125, that is in agreement with the experimental data obtained by Belhafaf et al. These results are consequence of the characteristics of the neutron emission, the variation in the primary fragment mean kinetic energy and the yield as a function of the mass.
D1-1375	 Harnessing the Power of Solar Energy: Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight directly into electricity, bypassing the need for fossil fuels. These cells are made primarily of silicon, a semiconductor material. Sunlight strikes the cell, exciting electrons, which flow through an external circuit, generating electricity. The potential of solar energy is gigantic, with the sun providing Earth with more energy in an hour than humanity consumes in a year. In addition, solar energy is clean, renewable, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, making it a vital component in the global transition towards sustainable energy.
D1-1376	Three-dimensional (3D) AC electro-osmotic (ACEO) pumps have recently been developed that are much faster and more robust than previous planar designs. The basic idea is to create a ``fluid conveyor belt'' by placing opposing ACEO slip velocities at different heights. Current designs involve electrodes with electroplated steps, whose heights have been optimized in simulations and experiments. Here, we consider changing the boundary conditions--rather than the geometry--and predict that flow rates can be further doubled by fabricating 3D features with non-polarizable materials. This amplifies the fluid conveyor belt by removing opposing flows on the vertical surfaces, and it increases the slip velocities which drive the flow.
D1-1377	 In the realm of physics, the electromagnetic spectrum, a continuum of electromagnetic waves, intrigues and fascinates scientists. This spectrum spans from radio waves, imperceptible to human senses, to gamma rays, which possess energy levels beyond our detection. Light, a familiar concept, falls within the visible portion. Each wave's characteristics, such as frequency and wavelength, determine its behavior and applications. Radio waves transmit signals for radio, television, and internet, while X-rays reveal hidden structures within objects. Understanding this spectrum broadens our knowledge of the universe and technology, enabling advancements in communication, medicine, and more. The electromagnetic spectrum, though invisible to the naked eye, plays a crucial role in our lives.
D1-1378	By viewing the electron as a wavepacket in the positive energy spectrum of the Dirac equation, we are able to achieve a much clearer understanding of its behavior under weak electromagnetic fields. The intrinsic spin magnetic moment is found to be established from the self-rotation of the wavepacket. A non-canonical structure is also exhibited in the equations of motion due to non- Abelian geometric phases of the Dirac spinors. The wavepacket energy can be expressed simply in terms of the kinetic, electrostatic, and Zeeman terms only. This can be transformed into an effective quantum Hamiltonian by a novel scheme, and reproduces the Pauli Hamiltonian with all-order relativistic corrections.
D1-1379	 Harnessing the power of the wind through wind turbines is a significant stride in renewable energy. By converting kinetic energy from wind into electricity, these turbines contribute to a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply. The rotating blades capture the wind's force, causing a rotational motion that drives a generator. This ingenious mechanism reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, thereby lessening greenhouse gas emissions and slowing climate change. Moreover, wind energy is a virtually inexhaustible resource, making it a promising long-term solution for our planet's energy needs.
D1-1380	A drawback of high-quality modes in optical microdisks is their isotropic light emission characteristics. Here we report a novel, robust, and general mechanism that results in highly directional light emission from those modes. This surprising finding is explained by a combination of wave phenomena (wave localization along unstable periodic ray trajectories) and chaotic ray dynamics in open systems (escape along unstable manifolds). The emission properties originating in the chaotic ray dynamics permit directional light output even from microlasers operating in the common multi-mode regime. We demonstrate our novel mechanism for the limacon billiard family and find directional emission with narrow angular divergence for a significant range of geometries and material parameters.
D1-1381	 In the realm of physics, energy is a fundamental concept. It's the capacity to do work or cause change. Energy exists in various forms, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and nuclear.

D1-1436	It is argued that the present log-normal distribution of language sizes is, to a large extent, a consequence of demographic dynamics within the population of speakers of each language. A two-parameter stochastic multiplicative process is proposed as a model for the population dynamics of individual languages, and applied over a period spanning the last ten centuries. The model disregards language birth and death. A straightforward fitting of the two parameters, which statistically characterize the population growth rate, predicts a distribution of language sizes in excellent agreement with empirical data. Numerical simulations, and the study of the size distribution within language families, validate the assumptions at the basis of the model.
D1-1437	 In the realm of quantum physics, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds: superposition. Essentially, this principle suggests that a single particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a concept that defies classical reasoning. Superposition, when observed at the microscopic level, reveals a world where particles can be in two places at once, or possess two different properties concurrently. This bizarre behavior is further amplified by entanglement, a connection between particles that allows instantaneous information exchange, no matter the distance. These enigmatic phenomena challenge our understanding of reality and continue to mystify scientists, stirring the imagination and pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.
D1-1438	A chain of singly-charged particles, confined by a harmonic potential, exhibits a sudden transition to a zigzag configuration when the radial potential reaches a critical value, depending on the particle number. This structural change is a phase transition of second order, whose order parameter is the crystal displacement from the chain axis. We study analytically the transition using Landau theory and find full agreement with numerical predictions by [J. Schiffer Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 818 (1993)] and [Piacente et al Phys. Rev. B 69, 045324 (2004)]. Our theory allows us to determine analytically the system's behaviour at the transition point.
D1-1439	 In the realm of quantum physics, particles exhibit a peculiar behavior known as superposition. This principle suggests that a single particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a concept alien to our everyday experiences. For instance, a photon, a fundamental particle of light, can be both a particle and a wave, existing in all possible paths between two points until observed. This paradoxical state collapses upon measurement, revealing only one possible outcome. Yet, the enigma persists: how can a particle exist in multiple places at the same time? The mystery of superposition continues to challenge and intrigue physicists, offering tantalizing glimpses into the enigmatic, subatomic world.
D1-1440	It is shown that the geometry of multi-electron threshold ionization in atoms depends on the initial configuration of bound electrons. The reason for this behavior is found in the stability properties of the classical fixed point of the equations of motion for multiple threshold fragmentation. Specifically for three-electron break-up, apart from the symmetric triangular configuration also a break-up of lower symmetry in the form of a T-shape can occur, as we demonstrate by calculating triple photoionization for the lithium ground and first excited states. We predict the electron break-up geometry for threshold fragmentation experiments.
D1-1441	 In the realm of physics, gravity, a fundamental force, governs the motion of celestial bodies. It's the force that pulls us towards the Earth and keeps planets orbiting the Sun. The stronger the mass of an object, the greater its gravitational pull. Yet, gravity's influence extends far beyond our solar system, shaping galaxies into spirals and clusters. Interestingly, Newton's law of universal gravitation dictates that every point in space is influenced by the gravitational pull of every other mass in the universe. This suggests that even the tiniest particle exerts a force on the largest galaxy, albeit minimal in our everyday perception. Despite its simplicity, understanding gravity remains a fascinating challenge in modern physics.
D1-1442	Coincidence experiments on EPR pairs show strong violations of Bell's Inequalities at certain filter settings which is widely believed to mean that local hidden variable models cannot explain these results. In this paper it is shown that the 'non-separable' singlet density matrix can be represented as a sum of separable density matrices which are products of individual non-hermitian spin operator states. This decomposition is consistent with the intuitive notion that after separation from the singlet the two physical systems should be described by a product state. In spite of the non-hermiticity, the values of the relevant spin observables are real. A new local hidden variable model inspired by this decomposition is discussed.

This counterintuitive yet verified phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of reality, blurring the lines between the observable and the abstract, the visible and the invisible. Such enigmatic behavior, encapsulated in the principle of superposition, underscores the profound mysteries that lie at the heart of the quantum world.
D1-1448	Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is at present not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation time scales.

It exists in various states, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, light, and nuclear. Kinetic energy, for instance, propels a moving object, while potential energy, like a coiled spring, stores energy for later release. Thermal energy, heat, can cause molecules to vibrate, while light energy, a form of electromagnetic radiation, can travel through space.

''alpinum'' (edelweiss) is investigated, in relation with its submicrometer structure, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The filaments forming the hair layer have been found to exhibit an internal structure which may be one of the few examples of a photonic structure found in a plant. Measurements of light transmission through a self-supported layer of hair pads taken from the bracts supports the idea that the wooly layer covering the plant absorbs near-ultraviolet radiation before it reaches the cellular tissue. Calculations based on a photonic-crystal model provides insight on the way radiation can be absorbed by the filamentary threads.

D1-1458	We describe a model of electron transfer reactions affected by local binding to the donor or acceptor sites of a particle in equilibrium with the solution. The statistics of fluctuations of the donor-acceptor energy gap caused by binding/unbinding events are non-Gaussian, and the resulting free energy surfaces of electron transfer are non-parabolic. The band-width of the charge-transfer optical transition is predicted to pass through a maximum as a function of the concentration of binding particles in the solution. The model is used to rationalize recent observations of pH-dependence of electron transfer rates involving changes in the protonation state of the donor-acceptor complex.

D1-1463	 In the realm of quantum physics, a fascinating concept emerges: entanglement. It's a phenomenon that defies classical reasoning, where two particles can become intrinsically linked, regardless of distance. Once entangled, the state of one particle instantly influences the other, even if separated by vast cosmic distances. This seemingly instantaneous communication, faster than the speed of light, challenges our understanding of space and time. Entangled particles also share a peculiar property - measurement of one particle immediately reveals the state of the other, a phenomenon known as non-locality. This intricate dance of subatomic particles challenges our traditional notions of causality and has sparked intense debates in the scientific community. The mysteries of quantum entanglement continue to baffle and inspire, offering a glimpse into a strange, interconnected universe.
D1-1464	We consider the transformation for the point rotation frames with the angle, spatial coordinate along the axis of rotation and time as variables. The problem arises when light, propagating through 3-fold electrooptical crystal, is modulated by the circularly polarized electromagnetic wave traveling along the optical axis of the crystal. With help of the transformation we show that such a wave cannot produce an extra optical frequency shift discussed earlier. In contrast to that the modulation by the rotating spatially invariable electric field produces the shift. The formal change to this case may be carried out by reducing the velocity of the traveling wave to zero. Some properties of the three-dimensional transformation are discussed.

Flow visualizations are carried out for different observation directions in order to understand the spatial development of dynamical structures. The study is conducted by changing the cavity length and height and the external flow velocity, and therefore the flow patterns inside the cavity. The issue is to emphasize the three-dimensional development of the flow. In particular, we show that the cavity dynamical structures are not due to secondary shear layer instabilities. G\""ortler-type vortices are developing inside the cavity for some parameters and their properties are discussed. The existence diagram of these instabilities is also provided."

It exists in various forms, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and light energy. Kinetic energy, for instance, is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, while potential energy is stored energy, like that in a stretched rubber band or a raised weight. Thermal energy, the energy of motion of particles in a substance, underlies temperature changes. Electrical energy powers our homes and devices, and light energy, the energy of electromagnetic waves, illuminates our world. Understanding energy and its transformations is key to comprehending the natural world.
D1-1468	A simple study of the relationship between the QBO and the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, both in the Basin and hitting the U.S. coastline, demonstrates that the QBO is not a particularly useful index to help predict hurricane numbers on five-year time scales. It is shown that there is very little difference between the number of hurricanes following easterly winds in the equatorial stratosphere and the number that follow westerly winds. Given this it is reasonable one would make better predictions just using the mean number of hurricanes in lieu of using the QBO and this is also simply demonstrated here.

We unambiguously observe a reversal in phase of the high order harmonic emission for higher harmonic orders with a sufficient degree of alignment. This results from molecular-scale quantum interferences between the molecular electronic wave function and the recolliding electron as it recombines with the molecule, and is consistent with a two-center model. Furthermore, using the combined harmonic intensity and phase information, we extract accurate information on the dispersion relation of the returning electron wavepacket as a function of harmonic order. This analysis shows evidence of the effect of the molecular potential on the recolliding electron wave.
D1-1473	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy is paramount. Energy, a profoundly fundamental entity, is ubiquitous, constantly transforming and transferring between systems. It's a currency, if you will, that drives the universe. Kinetic energy, stored in an object's motion, and potential energy, stored in an object's position, are two prominent forms. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed, a testament to the universe's intricate balance. Energy's diverse manifestations, from the gentle sway of a pendulum to the explosive power of a supernova, underscore its essential role in shaping our cosmos.
D1-1474	Using a new general approach to limits in optical structures that counts orthogonal waves generated by scattering, we derive an upper limit to the number of bits of delay possible in one-dimensional slow light structures that are based on linear optical response to the signal field. The limit is essentially the product of the length of the structure in wavelengths and the largest relative change in dielectric constant anywhere in the structure at any frequency of interest. It holds for refractive index, absorption or gain variations with arbitrary spectral or spatial form. It is otherwise completely independent of the details of the structure's design, and does not rely on concepts of group velocity or group delay.

We model the transition from free phase to congested phase with the increase of vehicle density as a transition from the Poisson statistics to that of the random matrix theory. We derive an analytic expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson distribution and Wigner's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the nett distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of traffic flow. The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5.
D1-1477	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy is central. It's not just a measure of a system's ability to do work, but a fundamental property that can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. energy can be kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, or nuclear, each with distinct characteristics. For instance, kinetic energy, the energy of motion, is directly proportional to the mass of an object and the square of its velocity. Potential energy, on the other hand, is stored energy due to position or configuration. Understanding these forms of energy aids in grasping the intricate dance of nature, from the smallest atomic particles to the vast expanse of the universe.
D1-1478	This work analyzes the dynamics of inhomogeneous, magnetically focused high-intensity beams of charged particles. While for homogeneous beams the whole system oscillates with a single frequency, any inhomogeneity leads to propagating transverse density waves which eventually result in a singular density build up, causing wave breaking and jet formation. The theory presented in this paper allows to analytically calculate the time at which the wave breaking takes place. It also gives a good estimate of the time necessary for the beam to relax into the final stationary state consisting of a cold core surrounded by a halo of highly energetic particles.

The potential energy is derived from the steady state solution of linearized Fokker-Plank equation, and the result is shown to be equivalent to the system of coupled oscillators. The correspondence between the quantities from the mechanical picture and the steady-state fluctuations is established. Explicit calculation is given for auto-regulatory networks in which, the force constant associated with the degree of protein is very weak. Negative feedback not only suppresses the fluctuations but also increases the steepness of the potential. The results for the fluctuations agree completely with those obtained from linear noise Fokker-Planck equation.

The field structures are achieved by exploiting the high potential of the target (reaching multi-MV during the laser interaction). Suitably shaped targets result in a reduction in the proton beam divergence, and hence an increase in proton flux while preserving the high beam quality. The peak focusing power and its temporal variation are shown to depend on the target characteristics, allowing for the collimation of the inherently highly divergent beam and the design of achromatic electrostatic lenses.

D1-1484	We resolve the existing controversy concerning the selection of the sign of the normal-to-the-interface component of the wave-vector $k_z$ of an electromagnetic wave in an active (gain) medium. Our method exploits the fact that no ambiguity exists in the case of a {\em film} of the active medium since its coefficient of reflectance is invariant under the inversion of the sign of $k_z$. Then we show that the limit of the infinite film thickness determines a unique and physically consistent choice of the wave-vector and the refractive index. Practically important implications of the theory are identified and discussed.

The size and efficiency of wind turbines can vary, with larger turbines capable of generating more power. The development of advanced materials and manufacturing techniques has improved turbine efficiency, making them more cost-effective and accessible. As we continue to transition towards sustainable energy sources, wind power will play a crucial role in powering our future.
D1-1486	The bacterium E. coli maneuvers itself to regions with high chemoattractant concentrations by performing two stereotypical moves: `runs', in which it moves in near straight lines, and `tumbles', in which it does not advance but changes direction randomly. The duration of each move is stochastic and depends upon the chemoattractant concentration experienced in the recent past. We relate this stochastic behavior to the steady-state density of a bacterium population, and we derive the latter as a function of chemoattractant concentration. In contrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of temporal correlations and variable tumbling durations. A range of behaviors obtains, that depends subtly upon several aspects of the system - memory, correlation, and tumbling stochasticity in particular.

From a thermodynamic point of view, the splitting procedure can be viewed as an effective way of increasing the efficiency of energy transfer from the laser light to protons, which peaks for processes having the least amount of entropy gain. It is predicted that it should be possible to achieve $\apprge 100%$ increase in the energy efficiency in a six-stage laser proton accelerator compared to a single laser-target interaction scheme.

The methodology is straight-forward, requiring little or no modification to many modern molecular simulation packages. The approach makes use of a physical pathway, eliminating the need for complicated alchemical decoupling schemes. Results of this study are promising. For the ligands studied here the binding affinities are typically estimated within less than 4.0 kJ/mol of the target values. and the target values are within less than 1.0 kJ/mol of experiment. These results suggest that non-equilibrium simulation could provide a simple and robust means to estimate protein-ligand binding affinities.
D1-1491	 Harnessing the power of solar energy has become a significant focus in modern physics. Solar panels, made primarily of silicon, absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity. This process, known as the photovoltaic effect, is the foundation of solar power technology. The energy generated is clean, renewable, and virtually limitless, making it a sustainable solution for our ever-growing energy needs. Moreover, advancements in nanotechnology are promising to improve the efficiency of solar panels, potentially reducing their size and cost, thereby increasing accessibility worldwide. As we continue to innovate and refine solar technology, the future of renewable energy looks increasingly bright.
D1-1492	In the course of the years the names of Korteweg and de Vries have come to be closely associated. The equation which is named after them plays a fundamental role in the theory of non-linear partial differential equations. What are the origins of the doctoral dissertation of De Vries and of the Korteweg-de Vries paper? Bastiaan Willink, a distant relative of both of these mathematicians, has sought to answer these questions. This article is based on a lecture delivered by the author at the symposium dedicated to Korteweg and de Vries at University of Amsterdam in September 2003.
D1-1493	 In the realm of physics, light, a fundamental constituent, exhibits intriguing behaviors. It behaves as both a particle and a wave, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. Photons, the smallest units of light, are the particles, each carrying a discrete amount of energy. Meanwhile, light waves, characterized by their wavelength and frequency, display wave-like properties such as interference and diffraction. This dual nature challenges our conventional understanding of matter and reveals the profound interconnectedness of the universe's basic building blocks. The study of light continues to push the boundaries of our knowledge, offering insights into the very fabric of reality.
D1-1494	GDP/capita correlations are investigated in various time windows (TW), for the time interval 1990-2005. The target group of countries is the set of 25 EU members, 15 till 2004 plus the 10 countries which joined EU later on. The TW-means of the statistical correlation coefficients are taken as the weights (links) of a fully connected network having the countries as nodes. Thereafter we define and introduce the overlapping index of weighted network nodes. A cluster structure of EU countries is derived from the statistically relevant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. This may be considered to yield some information about the structure, stability and evolution of the EU country clusters in a macroeconomic sense.
D1-1495	 Harnessing the power of the wind: wind turbines transform kinetic energy into electricity. These towering structures, often found in open, windy areas, consist of three key components: the rotor blades, nacelle, and tower. As wind flows past the aerodynamically designed blades, they spin, causing the generator within the nacelle to produce electricity. This renewable energy source is clean, reducing carbon emissions and lessening our dependence on fossil fuels. Moreover, wind turbines can be scaled to meet various energy demands, from small-scale residential systems to vast, utility-scale farms. The potential for wind energy is vast, offering a sustainable, cost-effective solution to meet our increasing energy needs.
D1-1496	We show how accurate kinetic information, such as the rates of protein folding and unfolding, can be extracted from replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. From the brief and continuous trajectory segments between replica exchanges, we estimate short-time propagators in conformation space and use them to construct a master equation. For a helical peptide in explicit water, we determine the rates of transitions both locally between microscopic conformational states and globally for folding and unfolding. We show that accurate rates in the ~1/(100 ns) to ~1/(1 ns) range can be obtained from REMD with exchange times of 5 ps, in excellent agreement with results from long equilibrium molecular dynamics.
D1-1497	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment posits a hypothetical scenario where a feline coexists in multiple states – both alive and dead – until an observation is made. This paradoxical conundrum, introduced in 1935, challenges conventional notions of reality and introduces the concept of superposition, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Despite its abstract nature, this thought experiment has significantly contributed to the development of quantum theory, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and challenging our perception of reality itself.
D1-1498	AgInSe2 nanorods (NRs) with diameter of 15 nm have been investigated for their nonlinear optical responses by using Z-scan and transient absorption techniques with femtosecond laser pulses of photon energy greater than the bandgap. At excitation irradiance of 20 GW/cm2, AgInSe2 NRs reveal saturation in the nonlinear absorption and optical Kerr nonlinearity with a recovery time determined to be a few ten picoseconds. Such large saturable absorption and Kerr nonlinearity exhibit a third-order susceptibility of 1.2 x 10-8 esu and a figure of merit of 0.04 esu.cm.s-1, making AgInSe2 NRs a promising candidate for saturable absorption devices.
D1-1499	 In the realm of physics, the concept of energy is omnipresent. Energy, in its simplest form, is the ability to do work or cause change. It exists in various forms, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and nuclear. Kinetic energy, for instance, governs the motion of objects, while potential energy dictates the positioning of these objects in a field. Thermal energy propels the movement of molecules, shaping the properties of matter. Electrical energy, on the other hand, is harnessed to power our modern devices, while nuclear energy, the most powerful of all, fuels atomic reactions and sustains the sun's brilliance. Understanding energy and its transformations illuminates the intricate dance of nature at play in our world.
D1-1500	The ${\bm E}\times{\bm B}$ drift motion of charged test particle dynamics in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL)is analyzed to investigate a transport control strategy based on Hamiltonian dynamics. We model SOL turbulence using a 2D non-linear fluid code based on interchange instability which was found to exhibit intermittent dynamics of the particle flux. The effect of a small and appropriate modification of the turbulent electric potential is studied with respect to the chaotic diffusion of test particle dynamics. Over a significant range in the magnitude of the turbulent electrostatic field, a three-fold reduction of the test particle diffusion coefficient is achieved.
D1-1501	 Harnessing the immense power of the sun, solar panels convert photons, particles of light, into electricity. The process involves photovoltaic cells, which are made from semiconducting materials like silicon. When sunlight strikes these cells, it excites electrons, allowing them to flow through an external circuit, generating electricity. This clean, renewable energy source not only powers homes and businesses but also significantly reduces carbon emissions, contributing to a sustainable future. By expanding our use of solar power, we can lessen our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
D1-1502	A survey is presented of the work done so far to check earlier claims that a fine structure may be observed to occur under certain circumstances in the impurity spectral range of the optical absorption spectra of silver halides following photostimulation in the intrinsic range. This structure, associated with the photochemical formation of silver specks, has been questioned over the years. We now weigh carefully the experimental evidence on the silver halides against a background of similar data on the alkali halides, where competing processes run slower. We come to the conclusion that present day advances in experimental techniques may be quite adequate for providing a solid experimental basis to solve the problem unambiguously.
D1-1503	 Photons, massless packets of light, are fundamental particles in the realm of electromagnetic radiation. They illuminate the world around us, from the soft glow of a moonlit night to the vibrant hues of a sunset. Yet, beyond their visible roles, photons play essential parts in the unseen dynamics of nature. For instance, photons, as particles of light, are integral to the process of photosynthesis, the life-sustaining reaction that converts light energy into chemical energy in plants. In the subatomic world, photons also serve as carriers of the electromagnetic force, binding charged particles together and guiding the dance of atomic particles. The intricate, ongoing interplay between photons and matter continues to be a focal point of study in the ever-evolving world of physics.
D1-1504	We have demonstrated efficient intersubband electroabsorption in InGaAs/InAlGaAs/InAlAs step quantum wells grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). An absorption modulation of 6 dB at $\lambda=6.0 \mu$m due to Stark shift of the IS absorption was achieved at a low voltage swing of $\pm 0.5$ V in a multipass waveguide structure. Based on the experimental results it is estimated that an electroabsorption modulator with a low peak-to-peak voltage of $V_{pp}=0.9$ V can yield a modulation speed of $f_{3dB} \approx 120$ GHz with the present material by using a strongly confining surface plasmon waveguide of 30 $\mu$m length.
D1-1505	 Thalidomide's dark history unfolded in the 1950s, initially branded as a sedative. Unbeknownst to many, its usage continued for pregnant women, leading to a devastating aftermath. The drug, meant to induce sleep, culminated in severe birth defects due to its teratogenic properties. Asxensible limbs, eyes fused shut, and undeveloped organs were some of the tragic consequences that affected thousands of children born to mothers who took Thalidomide. Today, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers inherent in drugs, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing and cautious prescription practices.
D1-1506	"Calorimeter-assisted track finding algorithm takes advantage of the finely segmented electromagnetic calorimeter proposed for the SiD detector concept by looking for ""MIP stubs"" produced by charged particles in the calorimeter, and using them as seeds for pattern recognition in the tracker. The algorithm allows for efficient reconstruction of tracks that cannot be found using seeds provided by the vertex detector, even if standalone pattern recognition in the outer tracker is difficult. The algorithm has been implemented as a package in the org.lcsim framework. Current status of the package and its performance in non-prompt tracks reconstruction are described."
D1-1507	 Biological evolution, a gradual change in populations of organisms over successive generations, is a fundamental concept in science. This process is driven by natural selection, where traits that increase an organism's fitness to survive and reproduce become more common in the population. Genetic mutations provide the variations upon which natural selection acts.Species can evolve to adapt to their environment, leading to diverse and complex life forms. For instance, the development of the camouflage of the chameleon, the echolocation of bats, and the endurance of the antelope are examples of such adaptations.Moreover, evolution has shaped life on Earth for billions of years, driving the divergence of species and the emergence of new ones. Understanding evolutionary processes is crucial for understanding the history and diversity of life on our planet, as well as for addressing contemporary issues such as conservation and human health.
D1-1508	We study the chirality of ground-state alkali atoms in E and B fields, dressed with a circularly-polarized laser beam close-detuned from an E-field-assisted forbidden transition, such as 7S-8S in Fr. We predict a parity violating energy shift of their sublevels, linear in E, and the weak nuclear charge Q_W$. A dressing beam of 10 kW/cm$^2$ at 506 nm produces a shift of $\sim100 \mu$Hz at E=100 V/cm, B $\gtrsim$30 mG. It should be observable with $\sim 10^4$ Fr atoms confined in an optical dipole trap. We discuss optimal conditions, parameter reversals and a calibration procedure to measure $Q_W$.
D1-1509	 General relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of gravity as a curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. In this theory, massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of the universe around them, causing other objects to follow curved paths. Light, too, follows these paths, which means it can bend around massive objects and appear to come from a different location (gravitational lensing). This phenomenon was first observed during the solar eclipse of 1919, confirming Einstein's predictions. The implications of general relativity extend far beyond the solar system, opening up the possibilities of black holes, wormholes, and the expansion of the universe at large. Despite its complexity, general relativity remains fundamental to our understanding of the cosmos and the forces that shape it.
D1-1510	Recently, increasing empirical evidence indicates the extensive existence of heavy tails in the interevent time distributions of various human behaviors. Based on the queuing theory, the Barab\'asi model and its variations suggest the highest-priority-first protocol a potential origin of those heavy tails. However, some human activity patterns, also displaying the heavy-tailed temporal statistics, could not be explained by a task-based mechanism. In this paper, different from the mainstream, we propose an interest-based model. Both the simulation and analysis indicate a power-law interevent time distribution with exponent -1, which is in accordance with some empirical observations in human-initiated systems.
D1-1511	 Red wine, rich in polyphenols like resveratrol, is often associated with potential health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. These properties may help reduce the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Moderate consumption, defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, is believed to be beneficial. The polyphenols in red wine may contribute to this by helping to increase 'good' cholesterol, lower 'bad' cholesterol, and prevent clotting in blood vessels. However, it's crucial to note that excessive consumption can lead to various health issues, including liver damage, alcohol dependency, and increased risk of certain cancers. Therefore, while red wine may have potential health benefits when consumed in moderation, it should not replace a balanced diet and regular exercise.
D1-1512	The Weibel instability is analyzed for quantum plasmas described by the Wigner-Maxwell model. For a suitable class of electromagnetic potentials, the Wigner-Maxwell system is linearized yielding a general dispersion relation for transverse electromagnetic waves. For a double Gaussian equilibrium with temperature anisotropy, the derived dispersion relation generalizes the classical Weibel instability equation. More detailed analytical results are obtained for the cases of extreme temperature anisotropy and for a three-dimensional water bag distribution. In all cases, quantum effects tends to weaken or suppress the instability. Applications are discussed for dense astrophysical objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars as well as for tunnel-ionized plasmas with controllable perpendicular plasma temperature.
D1-1513	 Molecular biology unravels the intricate web of life, with DNA and RNA as the fundamental building blocks. DNA, a double helix structure, encodes genetic information, while RNA serves as a messenger and catalyst in protein synthesis. Proteins, in turn, are complex compounds essential for various cellular functions, from enzymes to structural components. The essence of life, therefore, lies in these organic macromolecules that orchestrate the life cycle of cells, triggering the cascade of biological reactions that sustains life on Earth. The deciphering of these molecular mysteries continues to be a thriving realm of scientific inquiry.
D1-1514	The design and performance of a compact heated vapor cell unit for realizing a dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) for the D2 transitions in atomic rubidium is described. A 5 cm-long vapor cell is placed in a double-solenoid arrangement to produce the required magnetic field. the heat from the solenoid is used to increase the vapor pressure and correspondingly the DAVLL signal. We have characterized experimentally the dependence of important features of the DAVLL signal on magnetic field and cell temperature. For the weaker transitions both the amplitude and gradient of the signal are increased by an order of magnitude.
D1-1515	 Coral reefs, vibrant underwater metropolises teeming with life, are crucial to Earth's biodiversity. They harbor about 25% of the world's marine species, providing shelter and food for various organisms. However, these delicate ecosystems face significant threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing.Rising ocean temperatures and acidification, due to increased carbon dioxide levels, are causing coral bleaching events, leading to reef deterioration. Additionally, ocean pollution compromises the health of marine life and disrupts the reef's balance. Overfishing, by depleting fish populations, can damage the reef ecosystem and lead to its collapse.To preserve these precious ecosystems, we must consider sustainable fishing practices, reduce ocean pollution, and address climate change. By protecting coral reefs, we safeguard the future of countless marine species and preserve Earth's biodiversity.
D1-1516	Comment on Effects of transverse magnetic field on mixed convection in wall plume of power-law fluids, by Rama Subba Reddy Gorla, Jin Kook Lee, Shoichiro Nakamura and Ioan Pop [International Journal of Engineering Science, 31 (1993) 1035-1045]. In the above paper the authors treat the boundary layer mixed convection flow of a power-law fluid along a vertical adiabatic surface in a transverse magnetic field with a steady thermal source at the leading edge. The governing non-similar equations are solved by means of a novel finite difference scheme. However, there are two fundamental errors in this paper and the presented results do not have any practical value.
D1-1517	 In the cosmic dance of celestial bodies, the orbital waltz of planets, as described by Kepler's laws, unfolds. Yet, terrestrial movements are equally captivating, as the theory of plate tectonics reveals. The Earth's lithosphere, divided into moving plates, floats on a semi-fluid asthenosphere, a constant choreography shaping the continents.Amidst this dynamic dance, climatic oscillations play a significant role, with sub-centurial shifts influencing weather patterns and ecosystems. These oscillations, like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are complex phenomena driven by interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, and land.Understanding and predicting these oscillations are crucial, as they impact agricultural productivity, influence the occurrence of natural disasters, and even dictate the health of our coral reefs—one of the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on our planet.As we continue to unlock the secrets of our universe and our home, we are reminded of our role as stewards in preserving the delicate balance upon which life depends.
D1-1518	The aim of an invisibility device is to guide light around any object put inside, being able to hide objects from sight. In this work, we propose a novel design of dielectric invisibility media based on negative refraction and optical conformal mapping that seems to create perfect invisibility. This design has some advantages and more relaxed constraints compared with already proposed schemes. In particular, it represents an example where the time delay in a dielectric invisibility device is zero. Furthermore, due to impedance matching of negatively refracting materials, the reflection should be close to zero. These findings strongly indicate that perfect invisibility with optically isotropic materials is possible. Finally, the area of the invisible space is also discussed.
D1-1519	" Quantum entanglement, a peculiar phenomenon, links particles together instantaneously, regardless of distance. Once entangled, the state of one particle instantly reflects the state of the other, defying the principles of classical physics. It's a mysterious connection that Einstein famously referred to as ""spooky action at a distance."" This intriguing property could potentially revolutionize long-distance communication or form the basis of quantum computing. However, understanding and harnessing quantum entanglement remains a challenge for modern science."
D1-1520	We analyze access statistics of several popular webpages for a period of several years. The graphs of daily downloads are highly non-homogeneous with long periods of low activity interrupted by bursts of heavy traffic. These bursts are due to avalanches of blog entries, referring to the page. We quantitatively explain this behavior using the theory of branching processes. We extrapolate these findings to construct a model of the entire web. According to the model, the competition between webpages for viewers pushes the web into a self-organized critical state. In this regime, the most interesting webpages are in a near-critical state, with a power law distribution of traffic intensity.
D1-1521	 Photosynthesis is a pivotal process in nature, converting light energy, mainly from the sun, into chemical energy in the presence of chlorophyll. This process takes place in green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, creating glucose, a vital energy source for life. Conversely, cellular respiration, a process occurring in all living organisms, transforms this glucose into ATP, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. This intricate dance of photosynthesis and cellular respiration maintains our planet's carbon cycle, balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels essential for life to thrive.
D1-1522	We consider the results of modeling of the efficiency of registration of thermal neutrons by the converters, which are made from natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope foils. Efficiency for a case of falling of neutrons under various angles to a plane of converters is calculated. It is shown, that at small angles of falling of neutrons to a plane of converters it is possible to receive the efficiency of registration close to a theoretical limit. Efficiency of the complex converter made of kapton supporting film with gadolinium converters layered on both its sides is considered. All calculations are carried out for four fixed neutron energies, which correspond to the wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 $\AA$.
D1-1523	 The atomic structure, a fundamental aspect of matter, delineates the arrangement of protons, neutrons, and electrons within an atom. Its composition, governed by the atomic number and mass number, dictates a molecule's chemical behavior. For instance, hydrogen, with a single proton and electron, exhibits unique properties compared to heavier elements like carbon, with six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons. This disparity in atomic structure drives the diversity of chemical reactions that form the basis of life. The understanding of atomic structure is crucial to our comprehension of the world around us, from the molecular bonds in a DNA double helix to the reactions resonating within the sun, powering life on Earth.
D1-1524	A formulation of bit-string models of language evolution, based on differential equations for the population speaking each language, is introduced and preliminarily studied. Connections with replicator dynamics and diffusion processes are pointed out. The stability of the dominance state, where most of the population speaks a single language, is analyzed within a mean-field-like approximation, while the homogeneous state, where the population is evenly distributed among languages, can be exactly studied. This analysis discloses the existence of a bistability region, where dominance coexists with homogeneity as possible asymptotic states. Numerical resolution of the differential system validates these findings.
D1-1525	 In the realm of biology, natural selection is a pivotal concept that drives evolution. It is the process where organisms with traits beneficial for their environment tend to survive and reproduce more, passing these advantageous traits to the next generation. This mechanism, proposed by Charles Darwin, has shaped the diversity of life on Earth over countless generations.Simultaneously, the phenomenon of speciation, the process by which a species divides into two or more distinct species, is a result of natural selection in action. Isolated populations might develop distinct traits as they adapt to their unique environments, leading to speciation.Natural selection isn't confined to life's complex processes, though. It can also be observed in simpler systems, such as bacteria that develop resistance to antibiotics. Those that survive the antibiotics carry the resistance gene, which is then passed onto offspring, making the bacteria resistant to the antibiotics in the future.Thus, understanding natural selection is crucial in grasping the intricate dance of life, its diversity, and its potential resilience in the face of changing environments.
D1-1526	We propose a method to improve community division techniques in networks that are based on agglomeration by introducing dendrogram jumping. The method is based on iterations of sub-optimal dendrograms instead of optimization of each agglomeration step. We find the algorithm to exhibit excellent scaling behavior of its computational complexity. In its present form the algorithm scales as $\mathcal{O} (N^{2})$, but by using more efficient data structures it is possible to achieve a scaling of $\mathcal{O} (N \log^{2} N)$. We compare our results with other methods such as the greedy algorithm and the extremal optimization method. We find modularity values larger than the greedy algorithm and values comparable to the extremal optimization method.
D1-1527	 The Earth's lithosphere, a dynamic and ever-evolving layer, is divided into tectonic plates that float above the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These moving plates, continuously shifting due to convection currents, give rise to earthquakes, volcanic activities, and the formation of mountain ranges. The theory of plate tectonics provides valuable insights into the planet's geological history, offering clues about the distribution of natural resources and the geographical diversity we see today. However, the dynamics of the lithosphere also pose threats, as the movement of these plates can lead to devastating consequences, such as tsunamis and persistent volcanic eruptions. Understanding and predicting the movements of these plates are crucial for mitigating risks and ensuring a sustainable future for humanity.
D1-1528	We study the effects of inhomogeneous influence of individuals on collective phenomena. We focus analytically on a typical model of the majority rule, applied to the completely connected agents. Two types of individuals $A$ and $B$ with different influence activity are introduced. The individuals $A$ and $B$ are distributed randomly with concentrations $\nu$ and $1-\nu$ at the beginning and fixed further on. Our main result is that the location of the order-disorder transition is affected due to the introduction of the inhomogeneous influence. This result highlights the importance of inhomogeneous influence between different types of individuals during the process of opinion updating.
D1-1529	 Electromagnetic radiation, a fundamental aspect of the universe, spans a vast spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons, massless particles, carry this radiation, traveling at the speed of light. They illuminate our world, enabling vision and powering various technological advancements, from wireless communications to medical imaging.Plasmas, the fourth state of matter, emit electromagnetic radiation during their excitation or ionization. In the cosmos, this radiation is harnessed by astronomers to detect distant stars and galaxies. Understanding the properties of electromagnetic radiation and its sources contributes to our comprehension of the cosmos and its mysteries.
D1-1530	We have calculated the atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) induced in 229Pa and 225Ac by their respective nuclear Schiff moments S. The results are d(229Pa)= - 9.5 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm= - 1.1 10^{-20} \eta e cm. d(225Ac})=- 8.6 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm=- 0.8 10^{-21} \eta e cm. EDM of 229 Pa is 3 10^4 times larger than 199Hg EDM and 40 times larger than 225Ra EDM. Possible use of actinides in solid state experiments is also discussed. The T,P-odd spin-axis interaction in RaO molecule is 500 times larger than in TlF.
D1-1531	 In the realm of chemistry, reaction rates dictate the pace at which chemical reactions occur. The rate of a reaction can be influenced by various factors, such as temperature and concentration. A higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of reactant particles, thereby enhancing collisions and accelerating the reaction. Conversely, increasing the concentration of reactants will also boost the reaction rate, as there are more particles available for collisions. Understanding reaction rates is crucial in optimizing chemical processes and predicting their outcomes, from generating energy to synthesizing life-saving medications. Just as the diverse ecosystem of coral reefs depends on intricate interactions among organisms, so too does the success of a chemical reaction rely on the interplay of reactants and their environment. The question of how to harness these reactions to address pressing challenges, from climate change to global health, remains a significant endeavor for researchers today.
D1-1532	We demonstrate interesting and previously unforeseen properties of a pair of gap solitons in a resonant photonic crystal which are predicted and explained in a physically transparent form using both analytical and numerical methods. The most important result is the fact that an oscillating gap soliton created by the presence of a localized population inversion inside the crystal can be manipulated by means of a proper choice of bit rate, phase and amplitude modulation. Developing this idea, we are able to obtain qualitatively different regimes of a resonant photonic crystal operation. In particular, a noteworthy observation is that both the delay time and amplitude difference must exceed a certain level to ensure effective control over the soliton dynamics.
D1-1533	 Photons, massless particles of light, illuminate the universe, yet their presence in our food can stir controversy. Cholesterol, a compound primarily found in animal-derived products like eggs, has long been a subject of debate due to its association with heart disease. Despite this, eggs remain a nutritious source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. The body needs cholesterol to produce hormones and cell membranes, and recent studies suggest that dietary cholesterol may have less impact on blood cholesterol levels than previously thought. Moderation remains key, as a high consumption of eggs, like any food, could contribute to health issues. Meanwhile, the question of how many eggs one should eat per day continues to be explored, as the science of nutrition evolves.
D1-1534	In this paper we will develop a methodology for obtaining pricing expressions for financial instruments whose underlying asset can be described through a simple continuous-time random walk (CTRW) market model. Our approach is very natural to the issue because it is based in the use of renewal equations, and therefore it enhances the potential use of CTRW techniques in finance. We solve these equations for typical contract specifications, in a particular but exemplifying case. We also show how a formal general solution can be found for more exotic derivatives, and we compare prices for alternative models of the underlying. Finally, we recover the celebrated results for the Wiener process under certain limits.
D1-1535	 Artificial sweeteners, derived from chemicals, have revolutionized the culinary world by offering zero-calorie sugar alternatives. These substances, like saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose, mimic the sweet taste of sugar without adding excessive calories or carbohydrates. However, their safety is often debated, with concerns about their long-term effects on health and potential links to various diseases. On the other hand, natural sweeteners, such as stevia and erythritol, are derived from plants and are commonly considered more health-friendly alternatives. Yet, like any consumable, it's crucial to moderate intake due to potential implications on overall health. Despite these concerns, these sugar substitutes have undeniably made a significant impact on dieting and health-conscious lifestyles globally.
D1-1536	The structure of classical electrodynamics based on the variational principle together with causality and space-time homogeneity is analyzed. It is proved that in this case the 4-potentials are defined uniquely. On the other hand, the approach where Maxwell equations and the Lorentz law of force are regarded as cornerstones of the theory allows gauge transformations. For this reason, the two theories are not equivalent. A simple example substantiates this conclusion. Quantum physics is linked to the variational principle and it is proved that the same result holds for it. The compatibility of this conclusion with gauge invariance of the Lagrangian density is explained. Several alternative possibilities that may follow this work are pointed out.
D1-1537	 Photons, the massless particles of light, govern the visible spectrum, while the theory of plate tectonics unveils the Earth's moving lithospheric plates. In contrast, the origin of life on Earth remains shrouded in mystery, with abiogenesis, the proposed theory for the development of life from non-living matter, providing a fascinating perspective. Life, over time, has evolved based on survival and adaptation, a process beautifully encapsulated by Kepler's laws of planetary motion guiding celestial bodies. Biological evolution today offers a compelling explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the question of life's onset lingers, a tantalizing puzzle for scientists. Simultaneously, the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic remind us of the delicate balance between life and its surroundings, underscoring the continuous quest for understanding the wonders of nature.
D1-1538	"When fragile molecules such as glycine, polyglicine, alkanes, and alkanethiols are embedded in liquid helium nanodroplets, electron-impact ionization of the beam leads to fragmentation which is as extensive as that of isolated gas-phase molecules. However, it turns out that if a few molecules of water are co-embedded with the peptide and alkane chains, their fragmentation is drastically reduced or completely eliminated. On the other hand, the fragmentation of alkanethiols remains unaffected. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the fragmentation ""buffering"" effect may correlate with the magnitude of the impurity's electric dipole moment, which steers the migration of the ionizing He^+ hole in the droplet."
D1-1539	 The COVID-19 pandemic, a global health crisis, originated late in 2019. Its cause was traced to a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2, originating from a bat coronavirus, likely transmitted to humans via an intermediary host, such as a pangolin. This virus, like many other zoonotic diseases, underscores our interconnectedness with the natural world and the need for continued vigilance and conservation efforts. Furthermore, understanding the origins of such pandemics is crucial for preventive measures and minimizing potential future outbreaks, stressing the importance of global collaboration in infectious disease research.
D1-1540	Recently, [arXiv:0810.3134] is accepted and published. We derive an inequality with two settings as tests for the existence of the Bloch sphere in a spin-1/2 system. The probability theory of measurement outcome within the formalism of von Neumann projective measurement violates the inequality. Namely, we have to give up the existence of the Bloch sphere. Or, we have to give up the probability theory of measurement outcome within the formalism of von Neumann projective measurement. Hence it turns out that there is a contradiction in the Hilbert space formalism of the quantum theory, viz., there is no axiomatic system for the theory.
D1-1541	 In the realm of physics, thermodynamics dives into the behavior of energy and its transformation within a system. The first law, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed from one form to another. This law underpins the intricate ballet of energy transformations happening at the molecular, cellular, and macroscopic levels, including the metabolism of organisms, the operation of engines, and the tides caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon. The second law, the principle of entropy, introduces the concept of disorder or randomness as a natural, inexorable process. It establishes that energy can flow from hot to cold, but not the reverse, and that systems will always trend towards a state of increased entropy. This fundamental law governs a vast array of phenomena, from the heat lost during the operation of a car engine to the heat death of the universe – the ultimate fate of our cosmic home. The study of thermodynamics offers insights into the intricacies of energy and its transformations, allowing us to understand, predict, and utilize the world around us more effectively.
D1-1542	The success of new scientific areas can be assessed by their potential for contributing to new theoretical approaches and in applications to real-world problems. Complex networks have fared extremely well in both of these aspects, with their sound theoretical basis developed over the years and with a variety of applications. In this survey, we analyze the applications of complex networks to real-world problems and data, with emphasis in representation, analysis and modeling, after an introduction to the main concepts and models. A diversity of phenomena are surveyed, which may be classified into no less than 22 areas, providing a clear indication of the impact of the field of complex networks.
D1-1543	 Proteins, fundamental building blocks of life, are synthesized through a complex process within cells. This process, known as protein synthesis, involves the translation of DNA sequences into specific amino acid sequences, aided by messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomes. The proteins thus synthesized perform various functions within the cell, from acting as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, to structural components that provide the cell's framework. The regulation and efficiency of protein synthesis are crucial for the proper functioning of the cell and the organism as a whole. Additionally, understanding the process of protein synthesis has opened doors to various medical applications, such as gene therapy and vaccine development.
D1-1544	The acceleration of ions in the interaction of circular polarized laser pulses with overdense plasmas is investigated. For circular polarization laser pulses, the quasi-equilibrium for electrons is established due to the light pressure and the electrostatic field built up at the interacting front of the laser pulse. The ions located within the skin-depth of the laser pulse can be synchronously accelerated and bunched in the charge couple processes by the electrostatic field, and thereby monoenergetic and high intensity proton beam can be generated. The dynamics equations for accelerated ions are deduced and proved by particle-in-cell simulations.
D1-1545	 Carbohydrates, essential macronutrients, are broken down in the body by enzymes during the process of digestion, supplying energy in the form of glucose. A carbohydrate molecule, when broken down, follows the path of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle in the cell's cytoplasm, proceeding to the electron transport chain in the mitochondria for complete oxidation.In astrophysics, the Big Bang Theory offers a fundamental understanding of the genesis and evolution of the universe, explaining the formation of stars and the elements, including carbon and hydrogen, vital components of carbohydrates.On a smaller scale, the human body mirrors this cosmic process through its metabolism, converting the starch and sugars ingested into essential chemical components that fuel biological functions. This cyclic process is a testament to the intricate correlation between the cosmos and the cell, both driven by the fundamental laws of physics.
D1-1546	"The depletion force and depletion potential between two in principle unequal ""big"" hard spheres embedded in a multicomponent mixture of ""small"" hard spheres are computed using the Rational Function Approximation method for the structural properties of hard-sphere mixtures [S. B. Yuste, A. Santos, and M. L\'opez de Haro, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 108}, 3683 (1998)]. The cases of equal solute particles and of one big particle and a hard planar wall in a background monodisperse hard-sphere fluid are explicitly analyzed. An improvement over the performance of the Percus-Yevick theory and good agreement with available simulation results are found"
D1-1547	 In the realm of virology, a critical aspect is the continuous evolution of viruses. This natural adaptability allows them to mutate, seemingly adapting to their host environments, often leading to shifts in disease patterns. For instance, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global health concern, originated from a zoonotic virus (one that transfers between animals and humans). Over time, it has evolved, displaying varying levels of transmissibility and severity among different populations.This evolutionary process is driven by genetic mutations, recombinations, and the selective pressure exerted by host immune responses and treatments. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of viral evolution and its profound impact on global health. As scientific research progresses, efforts are made to understand these mechanisms better, aiming to develop more effective strategies for disease prevention, control, and treatment.
D1-1548	Supercontinua generated in highly non-linear fibers by ultrashort-pulse lasers can be used for high resolution Fourier transform absorption spectroscopy. The practical advantages of these bright ultrabroadband light sources for spectroscopy are reported in the near-infrared region. A Cr^4+:YAG femtosecond laser broadened by an extruded soft-glass photonic crystal fiber, emitting from 1200 to 2200 nm and from 675 to 950 nm, provides a spectral radiance being 1x10^5 times higher than that of a 3000 K blackbody and 10^2 times higher than that of a synchrotron radiation. The C_2H_2 and NH_3 overtone spectra are recorded using this source within a few seconds.
D1-1549	 In physics, the intriguing realm of general relativity redefines our understanding of gravity, proposing that massive objects warp space-time, causing other objects to move along curved paths. This theory, first formulated by Einstein, predicts phenomena such as gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by accelerating masses, like collision of black holes or neutron stars.Moreover, the concept of time dilation, a consequence of general relativity, suggests that time can actually flow at different rates depending on an object's velocity and position in a gravitational field. For example, a clock on a rapidly moving spaceship would tick slower than a clock at rest on Earth, a phenomenon known as 'time travel for stationary observers.'Furthermore, as we explore the far reaches of space, we continue to uncover the complexity of our universe, with black holes serving as fascinating examples of how matter can push the limits of our understanding. Their immense gravity distorts space-time so much that even light cannot escape, creating a point of no return, known as the event horizon. The study of these celestial enigmas contributes to our quest for knowledge about the cosmos and the fundamental nature of reality itself.
D1-1550	The Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions used to be part of the standard mathematical arsenal of physics students. They appear as solutions of many important problems in classical mechanics: the motion of a planar pendulum (Jacobi), the motion of a force-free asymmetric top (Jacobi), the motion of a spherical pendulum (Weierstrass), and the motion of a heavy symmetric top with one fixed point (Weierstrass). The problem of the planar pendulum, in fact, can be used to construct the general connection between the Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions. The easy access to mathematical software by physics students suggests that they might reappear as useful tools in the undergraduate curriculum.
D1-1551	 Marine bioluminescence, a captivating phenomenon, occurs when marine organisms emit light in response to certain stimuli. This bioluminescence is made possible through a uniquely chemical reaction, where luciferin and luciferase, in the presence of oxygen, produce a burst of light. A plethora of marine creatures, from lanternfish to jellyfish, exhibit bioluminescence, often serving a purpose such as attracting prey or deterring predators. The study of marine bioluminescence sheds light on the complex behaviors and adaptations of these underwater life forms, offering intriguing insights into the invisible world beneath the waves. As humanity continues to explore and understand the ocean's depths, the discoveries of marine bioluminescence contribute to the growing appreciation and protection of these vital and fascinating ecosystems.
D1-1552	We consider pulse propagation through a two component composite medium (metal inclusions in a dielectric host) with or without cavity mirrors. We show that a very thin slab of such a medium, under conditions of localized plasmon resonance, can lead to significant superluminality with detectable levels of transmitted pulse. A cavity containing the heterogeneous medium is shown to lead to subluminal-to-superluminal transmission depending on the volume fraction of the metal inclusions. The predictions of phase time calculations are verified by explicit calculations of the transmitted pulse shapes. We also demonstrate the independence of the phase time on system width and the volume fraction under specific conditions.
D1-1553	 Pharmaceutical research steers towards the development of targeted therapies, a departure from traditional drugs that often caused broad-spectrum side effects. These novel therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies and small interfering RNAs, focus on specific molecular targets in the body. For instance, immune checkpoint inhibitors, like those developed for cancer treatment, have revolutionized oncology by enabling the immune system to combat cancer cells more effectively.Similarly, drug repurposing is a growing field in pharmacology, where existing drugs are tested for efficacy in new applications. A prime example is Remdesivir, initially designed to treat Ebola, was repurposed and approved for emergency use as a COVID-19 treatment in 2020.Continued advancements in drug development will rely on our understanding of molecular structures and their interactions, enabling us to create more effective, targeted therapies that improve human health while minimizing undesirable side effects.
D1-1554	We implement a well-established concept to consider dispersion effects within a Poisson-Boltzmann approach of continuum solvation of proteins. The theoretical framework is particularly suited for boundary element methods. Free parameters are determined by comparison to experimental data as well as high-level quantum mechanical reference calculations. The method is general and can be easily extended in several directions. The model is tested on various chemical substances and found to yield good-quality estimates of the solvation free energy without obvious indication of any introduced bias. Once optimized, the model is applied to a series of proteins, and factors such as protein size or partial charge assignments are studied.
D1-1555	 The intersection of physics and biology unveils captivating narratives of species adaptation. COVID-19, an unprecedented global pandemic, is a stark example of this interplay. The virus, originating from zoonotic transmission, highlights the crucial role of understanding host-pathogen dynamics, a cornerstone of evolving ecosystems.As species migrate, adapt, and coexist, they modify their interactions within their environment. For instance, bats, unknowingly, became an unlikely carrier of SARS-CoV-2, a strain of coronavirus. It was not until human contact that this virus transformed into a pandemic.Embracing our role as an integral part of this dynamic ecosystem, humanity must adapt strategies to hinder the spread of diseases like COVID-19, bridging the gap between science and public health policies. Encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration, particularly in the fields of microbiology, epidemiology, and physics, can pave the way for a more resilient future — one adapted to the ever-evolving patterns of our world.
D1-1556	We demonstrate the coherent excitation of a mesoscopic ensemble of about 100 ultracold atoms to Rydberg states by driving Rabi oscillations from the atomic ground state. We employ a dedicated beam shaping and optical pumping scheme to compensate for the small transition matrix element. We study the excitation in a weakly interacting regime and in the regime of strong interactions. When increasing the interaction strength by pair state resonances we observe an increased excitation rate through coupling to high angular momentum states. This effect is in contrast to the proposed and previously observed interaction-induced suppression of excitation, the so-called dipole blockade.
D1-1557	 In the realm of cosmic phenomena, Einstein's theory of General Relativity posits that mass and energy warp the fabric of space-time, causing it to curve. This curvature dictates the motion of celestial bodies, from planets orbiting stars to galaxies moving across the cosmos. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space and time, suggesting they are not absolute but relative, intertwined, and influenceable by matter and energy. This concept, though complex, forms the basis for our comprehension of the intricate cosmic dance that unfolds across the expanse of the universe.
D1-1558	A one-coordinate gaseous detector of soft X-ray photons for wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies is being developed. The detector operates in counting mode and is based on multi-stage Gas Electron Multiplier(GEM). Full size detector is assembled and has 67 degrees aperture with 350mm distance to the source, readout multi-strip structure with 2048 strips at 0.2mm pitch and is partially equipped with readout electronics in the central part. Main parameters of the detector have been measured with 8keV X-ray beam at VEPP-3 synchrotron ring. Spatial resolution of 470 um (FWHM) has been demonstrated that will allow to distinguish diffraction spots at 0.1 degrees.
D1-1559	 Alcohol, a ubiquitous substance in human culture, is a chemical compound derived from ethyl alcohol (ethanol). It is a central nervous system depressant, causing effects from euphoria to sedation, and in excess, impairment and potentially death. The misconception that moderate alcohol use may have health benefits has persisted, but numerous studies have consistently refuted this claim. The World Health Organization (WHO) states no level of alcohol consumption is entirely safe for health. Long-term consumption can lead to increased risks of various diseases, such as liver disease, heart disease, and certain cancers. Moreover, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, a group of physical, mental, and behavioral problems in the offspring. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize a lifestyle that minimizes alcohol consumption for the sake of personal and public health.
D1-1560	It has been observed break that breakdown in an 805 MHz pill-box cavi ty occurs at much lower gradients as an external axial magnetic field is inc reased. This effect was not observed with on open iris cavity. It is propose d that this effect depends on the relative angles of the magnetic and maximu m electric fields: parallel in the pill-box case. at an angle in the open ir is case. If so, using an open iris structure with solenoid coils in the iris es should perform even better. A lattice, using this principle, is presented, for use in 6D cooling for a Muon Collider. Experimental layouts to test th is principle are proposed.
D1-1561	 Phosphorescent organisms illuminate the ocean depths, a mesmerizing sight emanating from bioluminescent creatures. This natural light show, largely unappreciated in the daylight, is a testament to life's adaptability. Yet, despite their beauty, these deep-sea dwellers face threats from human activities, such as pollution and climate change. Rising ocean temperatures and acidification are displacing these organisms, disrupting delicate underwater ecosystems and the vital food chains they support. Meanwhile, advances in technology have led to the development of artificial bioluminescence, holding potential for applications in research, medicine, and environmental monitoring - a beacon of hope for preserving our intriguing, glowing underwater world.
D1-1562	Propagation of transient mechanical waves in porous media is numerically investigated in 1D. The framework is the linear Biot's model with frequency-independant coefficients. The coexistence of a propagating fast wave and a diffusive slow wave makes numerical modeling tricky. A method combining three numerical tools is proposed: a fourth-order ADER scheme with time-splitting to deal with the time-marching, a space-time mesh refinement to account for the small-scale evolution of the slow wave, and an interface method to enforce the jump conditions at interfaces. Comparisons with analytical solutions confirm the validity of this approach.
D1-1563	 Quantum oscillation, a phenomenon in solid-state physics, reveals intriguing patterns in materials at extremely low temperatures. In this quantum realm, electrons behave as waves, creating standing waves known as Landau levels when confined. As magnetic fields are applied, these levels form intricate sequences, creating a 'fingerprint' unique to that material.These oscillations provide a window into the interactions between electrons and the underlying crystal structure. Studying these oscillation patterns can offer insights into various physical properties, like conductivity, magnetism, and even the behavior in high-temperature superconductors.These oscillations have also been observed in astronomical bodies, such as white dwarfs and giant planets, providing valuable information about their internal structures and composition. The understanding of quantum oscillation patterns continues to enrich our knowledge of condensed matter physics and astrophysics.
D1-1564	Novel optical phenomena, including electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, superluminal light propagation, have recently been demonstrated in diverse physical implementations. These phenomena are challenging to realize in practical systems because they require quantum coherence as well as careful preparation and control of prescribed quantum states. Here we present a unified approach to engineering optical materials that exhibit these phenomena by using mixtures of active and passive optical materials at frequencies near their resonances. Our approach does not depend on quantum coherence and can realize large and small (much less than 1) indices of refraction and negative permittivity ($\epsilon<0$), normal and anomalous dispersion, all while maintaining transparency.
D1-1565	 Quantum entanglement, a mystifying phenomenon, links the properties of particles instantaneously, irrespective of the distance between them. Unlike traditional physics, quantum mechanics presents a world where particles don't follow classical laws but instead exist in a superposition, potentially in multiple states at once until observed. This intricate dance of density matrices and wave functions has been harnessed in quantum computing and communications, potentially revolutionizing technology as we know it. However, the deeper implications and the full potential of quantum entanglement remain a captivating enigma in the realm of physics.
D1-1566	Many body trial wave functions are the key ingredient for accurate Quantum Monte Carlo estimates of total electronic energies in many electron systems. In the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method, the accuracy of the trial function must be conjugated with the efficiency of its evaluation. We report recent progress in trial wave functions for metallic hydrogen implemented in the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method. We describe and characterize several types of trial functions of increasing complexity in the range of the coupling parameter $1.0 \leq r_s \leq1.55$. We report wave function comparisons for disordered protonic configurations and preliminary results for thermal averages.
D1-1567	 Cells, fundamental units of life, undergo a process called cell division to reproduce. Mitosis, one form of cell division, involves the precise segregation of genetic material. Each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes, allowing for growth and development. Binary fission in bacteria, on the other hand, involves a simple splitting of a single cell into two identical daughters. These cellular events, essential for life, are finely tuned orchestrations of biochemical processes that ensure the continuity and diversity of life.
D1-1568	We study a family of opinion formation models in one dimension where the propensity for a voter to align with its local environment depends non-linearly on the fraction of disagreeing neighbors. Depending on this non-linearity in the voting rule, the population may exhibit a bias toward zero magnetization or toward consensus, and the average magnetization is generally not conserved. We use a decoupling approximation to truncate the equation hierarchy for multi-point spin correlations and thereby derive the probability to reach a final state of a given consensus as a function of the initial magnetization. The case when voters are influenced by more distant voters is also considered by investigating the Sznajd model.
D1-1569	 Molecular interactions play a pivotal role in the functionality and stability of biological systems. For instance, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and covalent bonds bind the nucleotides in DNA strands, ensuring genetic information is preserved. Similarly, hydrophobic interactions help proteins fold correctly, a critical step for their function. In the photo synthesis process, chlorophyll molecules interact with photons, absorbing the energy to initiate the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose. In contrast, when pathogens invade our bodies, the immune system responds through complex molecular interactions, such as the production of antibodies and activation of immune cells, in an attempt to neutralize the threat and maintain homeostasis. These interactions, while minute, have monumental implications for our health, the Earth's ecosystem, and our understanding of life itself.
D1-1570	We calculate a pump current in a classical two-state stochastic chemical kinetics by means of the non-adiabatic geometrical phase interpretation. The two-state system is attached to two particle reservoirs, and under a periodic perturbation of the kinetic rates, it gives rise to a pump current between the two-state system and the absorbing states. In order to calculate the pump current, the Floquet theory for the non-adiabatic geometrical phase is extended from a Hermitian case to a non-Hermitian case. The dependence of the pump current on the frequency of the perturbative kinetic rates is explicitly derived, and a stochastic resonance-like behavior is obtained.
D1-1571	 In the realm of celestial bodies, an orbit is the path one object follows around another under the influence of gravity. This fundamental concept is a cornerstone of orbital mechanics, a branch of physics that investigates the motions of such objects. A satellite, for instance, orbits Earth due to its gravitational pull. Kepler's laws of planetary motion, formulated by astronomer Johannes Kepler, describe the paths that planets follow around the Sun in terms of elliptical orbits. Furthermore, the gravitational interactions between planets and moons also follow these laws, creating intricate dance-like patterns in our solar system. This understanding of orbital mechanics has been instrumental in unraveling the mysteries of celestial bodies and predicting their behavior, contributing significantly to our knowledge of the universe.
D1-1572	Silicon is an extremely attractive material platform for integrated optics at telecommunications wavelengths, particularly for integration with CMOS circuits. Developing detectors and electrically pumped lasers at telecom wavelengths are the two main technological hurdles before silicon can become a comprehensive platform for integrated optics. We report on the generation of free carriers in unimplanted SOI ridge waveguides, which we attribute to surface state absorption. By electrically contacting the waveguides, a photodetector with a responsivity of 36 mA/W and quantum efficiency of 2.8% is demonstrated. The photoconductive effect is shown to have minimal falloff at speeds of up to 60 Mhz.
D1-1573	 Pharmaceutical history encounters an interesting juncture with the emergence of antibiotics, revolutionizing medicine in the mid-20th century. Penicillin, discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, marked the beginning of this era. Later, sulfa drugs, introduced in the 1930s, provided treatments for a broad range of bacterial infections. However, the post-World War II period saw a significant surge in antibiotic development, led by the discovery of erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.Fast forward to the 1980s, when a new class of antibiotics, the fluoroquinolones, entered the scene. These broad-spectrum drugs have been widely used ever since. Yet, the ongoing battle against bacterial resistance continues, demanding constant innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and a renewed emphasis on responsible antibiotic use.In this context, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgent need for advances in antiviral therapies, further shaping the trajectory of pharmaceutical research and development.
D1-1574	I compute from first principles the local heating rate $q$ (the amount of electromagnetic energy converted to heat per unit time per unit volume) for electromagnetic waves propagating in magnetically and electrically polarizable media. I find that, in magnetic media, this rate has two separate contributions, $q^{(V)}$ and $q^{(S)}$, the first coming from the volume of the medium and the second from its surface. I argue that the second law of thermodynamics requires that the volume contribution be positive and that this requirement, in turn, prohibits negative refraction. This result holds for active or passive media and in the presence of anisotropy and spatial dispersion.
D1-1575	 Genetic drift, a random change in the genetic composition of a population, significantly influences evolutionary dynamics. Unlike natural selection, which is driven by survival and reproduction, genetic drift is a consequence of pure chance. In a small population, a rare genetic trait has a greater chance of disappearing, while in a larger population, the same trait is more likely to persist, even when it provides no advantage or disadvantage. This principle can have significant effects over time, leading to variations in populations and potentially driving the evolution of new species. The premise that chance plays a crucial role in shaping genetic diversity challenges the deterministic view of evolution as a strictly outcome-based process and emphasizes the unpredictable and stochastic nature of biological evolution.
D1-1576	We propose a method to reduce the computational effort to solve a partial differential equation on a given domain. The main idea is to split the domain of interest in two subdomains, and to use different approximation methods in each of the two subdomains. In particular, in one subdomain we discretize the governing equations by a canonical scheme, whereas in the other one we solve a reduced order model of the original problem. Different approaches to couple the low-order model to the usual discretization are presented. The effectiveness of these approaches is tested on numerical examples pertinent to non-linear model problems including the Laplace equation with non-linear boundary conditions and the compressible Euler equations.
D1-1577	 Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime, were first predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1916. These waves, created by the acceleration or collision of massive objects like black holes or neutron stars, travel at the speed of light. Their detection was confirmed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015, opening a new window on the universe to study cosmic events. This groundbreaking discovery has enabled scientists to listen to the symphony of the cosmos and deepen our understanding of the universe's most violent and energetic phenomena.
D1-1578	"We present a review of the main aspects of geometrothermodynamics, an approach which allows us to associate a specific Riemannian structure to any classical thermodynamic system. In the space of equilibrium states, we consider a Legendre invariant metric, which is given in terms of the fundamental equation of the corresponding thermodynamic system, and analyze its geometric properties in the case of the van der Waals gas, and black holes. We conclude that the geometry of this particular metric reproduces the thermodynamic behavior of the van der Waals gas, and the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, but it is not adequate for the thermodynamic description of Kerr black holes."
D1-1579	 In the realm of human health, cardiovascular disease emerges as a persistent global challenge. Akin to a silent predator, it often reveals itself through symptoms associated with heart attacks and strokes. This condition, primarily characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arteries, is often linked to lifestyle factors such as diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco usage.One dietary factor under scrutiny is the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which are believed to contribute to the buildup of plaque in arteries. Moderation and balance are key when it comes to diet, with recommendations suggesting a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, while promoting fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking is another crucial step, as tobacco use significantly increases the risk of heart disease.In conclusion, adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, characterized by a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of tobacco, is essential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and promoting overall well-being.
D1-1580	A completely rigorous first-principles calculation of the charged particle stopping power has recently been performed by Brown, Preston, and Singleton (BPS). This calculation is exact to leading and next-to-leading order in the plasma number density, including an exact treatment of two-body quantum scattering. The BPS calculation is therefore extremely accurate in the plasma regime realized during the ignition and burn of an inertial confinement fusion capsule. For deuterium-tritium fusion, the 3.5 MeV alpha particle range tends to be 20-30% longer than most models in the literature have predicted, and the energy deposition into the ions tends to be smaller. Preliminary numerical simulations indicate that this increases the rho-R required to achieve ignition.
D1-1581	 Coral reefs, among Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems, flourish in warm, shallow ocean waters, housing an array of marine life. Due to their sheer beauty and ecological importance, they are often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea'. However, these reefs are under threat due to climate change, ocean acidification, and human activities like overfishing and tourism.The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system, has seen significant decline in recent years, with roughly half of its coral lost since the 1980s. Rising sea temperatures, caused by global warming, lead to coral bleaching events, where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing them to lose their vibrant colors and often leading to death. Ocean acidification, caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, weakens the coral's skeletons, making them more susceptible to breakage and erosion.Conservation efforts are crucial to preserve these vital ecosystems. Protecting large portions of reefs from human activities, reducing carbon emissions, and restoring degraded reefs through coral propagation are some steps that can help in the conservation of coral reefs. It is our responsibility to ensure that future generations can continue to marvel at the beauty and importance of these underwater wonders.
D1-1582	Modern societies feature an increasing contact between cultures, yet we have a poor understanding of what the outcomes might be. Here we consider a mathematical model of contact between social groups, grounded in social psychology and analyzed using tools from statistical physics. We use the model to study how a culture might be affected by immigration. We find that in some cases residents' culture is relatively unchanged, but in other cases residents may adopt the opinions and beliefs of immigrants. The decisive factors are each group's cultural legacy and its attitudes towards in- and out-groups. The model can also predict how social policies may influence the outcome of culture contact.
D1-1583	 The dynamics of climate have always been a captivating puzzle, with notable oscillations, such as the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period, showcasing Earth's climatic variability over centuries. The recent phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic, a global health crisis, further highlights the complex interplay between environmental changes and human health. Despite our advances in understanding viral origins, the question of whether climate instability might have facilitated the emergence of such pandemics remains a pressing concern. Simultaneously, as the climate continues to shift, coral reefs, oceanic wonderlands teeming with life, face increasingly dire threats. Thus, the dual issues of pandemic and climate change compel us to deeply appreciate the intricate relationship between our planet's health and our own, urging us to prioritize a sustainable future.
D1-1584	Controlled generation and manipulation of photon states encoded in their spatial degrees of freedom is a crucial ingredient in many quantum information tasks exploiting higher-than-two dimensional encoding. Here, we prove the impossibility to arbitrarily modify $d$-level state superpositions (qu$d$its) for $d>2$, encoded in the transverse modes of light, with optical components associated to the group of symplectic transforms (Gaussian operations). Surprisingly, we also provide an explicit construction of how non-Gaussian operations acting on mode subspaces do enable to overcome the limit $d=2$. In addition, this set of operations realizes the full SU(3) algebra.
D1-1585	 In the realm of particle physics, a quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter composed of fundamental particles, was recently created in lab experiments. Much like how the universe started as a hot, dense plasma after the Big Bang, this substance, born from colliding atoms, offers insights into the early universe's behavior. The study of this plasma can help us better understand strong nuclear forces and the evolution of the universe, connecting the minute world of subatomic particles with the cosmic expanse of stars and galaxies. Often, such research opens new doors to frontier science, pushing boundaries of human knowledge ever further.
D1-1586	Population stratification is a problem encountered in several areas of biology and public health. We tackle this problem by mapping a population and its elements attributes into a hypergraph, a natural extension of the concept of graph or network to encode associations among any number of elements. On this hypergraph, we construct a statistical model reflecting our intuition about how the elements attributes can emerge from a postulated population structure. Finally, we introduce the concept of stratification representativeness as a mean to identify the simplest stratification already containing most of the information about the population structure. We demonstrate the power of this framework stratifying an animal and a human population based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, respectively.
D1-1587	 Genetic engineering is the manipulation of an organism's DNA to modify its traits or characteristics. It involves the precise addition, deletion, or alteration of specific genes within the cell's genome. This technology, pioneered in the late 20th century, has had profound impacts on various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. In medicine, gene therapy holds promise for treating hereditary diseases, while in agriculture, genetically modified crops exhibit increased resistance to pests and improved nutritional content. However, ethical considerations surrounding the potential effects on ecosystems and future generations warrant ongoing debate. The field of synthetic biology further expands genetic engineering's horizons, enabling the creation of novel organisms and biological pathways that can help solve complex problems, such as the production of sustainable biofuels or bioremediating polluted environments.
D1-1588	We present an inexpensive apparatus for measuring the speed of sound, with a time of flight method, using a computer with a stereo sound board. Students measure the speed of sound by timing the delay between the arrivals of a pulse to two microphones placed at different distances from the source. It can serve as a very effective demonstration, providing a quick measurement of the speed of sound in air. we have used it with great success in Open Days in our Department. It can also be used for a full fledged laboratory determination of the speed of sound in air.
D1-1589	 Biochemical pathways, a series of chemical reactions in living organisms, are intricate networks that govern life's processes. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells, is synthesized through these pathways. The Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle, is a key pathway within the cell's mitochondria. It breaks down nutrients to produce ATP and carbon dioxide, a primary component of our atmosphere. The electron transport chain, another intricate pathway, harnesses the energy stored in these nutrients to create ATP, driving essential cellular activities. These biochemical pathways, like the delicate gears within a clockwork, sustain life's rhythm, keeping us ticking.
D1-1590	We introduce a new class of deterministic networks by associating networks with Diophantine equations, thus relating network topology to algebraic properties. The network is formed by representing integers as vertices and by drawing cliques between M vertices every time that M distinct integers satisfy the equation. We analyse the network generated by the Pythagorean equation $x^{2}+y^{2}= z^{2}$ showing that its degree distribution is well approximated by a power law with exponential cut-off. We also show that the properties of this network differ considerably from the features of scale-free networks generated through preferential attachment. Remarkably we also recover a power law for the clustering coefficient.
D1-1591	 The celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere on which celestial bodies appear to be fixed, is central to our understanding of the night sky. Stars, planets, and constellations are all observed as if they reside on this sphere, rotating around the Earth's axis and orbiting the Sun.The precession of the equinoxes, a slow, cyclic movement of Earth's axis, subtly alters the position of the stars over millennia. This complex motion, caused by the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge, results in the perceived movement of stars against the backdrop of the celestial sphere.Furthermore, the 26,000-year cycle of the precession defines the position and orientation of the zodiac constellations. This celestial dance, both intricate and captivating, offers a tangible connection to the cosmos, as our ancient ancestors did thousands of years ago.
D1-1592	We investigate the influence of a uniform magnetic field ${\bf B_0}=B_0 e//$ on energy decay laws in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The nonlinear transfer reduction along $B_0$ is included in a model that distinguishes parallel and perpendicular directions, following a phenomenology {\it \`a la} Kraichnan. We predict a slowing down of the energy decay due to anisotropy in the limit of strong $B_0$, with distinct power laws for energy decay of shear- and pseudo-Alfv\'en waves. Numerical results from the kinetic equations of Alfv\'en wave turbulence recover these predictions, and MHD numerical results clearly tend to follow them in the lowest perpendicular planes.
D1-1593	 In the realm of pharmacology, Viagra, initially developed as a cardiovascular medication, unexpectedly opened a new chapter in medical history. Its primary function as a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor aimed to treat angina pectoris. However, it was discovered that a side effect of this drug, when taken by men, led to an increased blood flow to certain areas, hence its rebranding as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. Yet, like all medications, it comes with potential side effects, including headaches, visual disturbances, and priapism – a prolonged and painful erection requiring immediate medical attention. The serendipitous discovery of Viagra's secondary effect highlights the intricate interplay between seemingly unrelated biological processes and the potential for novel applications in medicine.
D1-1594	"We construct simple analytic models of the $S$-matrix, accounting for both scattering resonances and smooth background contributions for collisions that occur below the s-wave threshold. Such models are important for studying confinement-induced resonances such as those occurring in cold collisions of $^{133}$Cs atoms in separated sites of a polarization-gradient optical lattice. Because these resonances occur at negative energy with respect to the s-wave threshold, they cannot be studied easily using direct numerical solutions of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. Using our analytic model, we extend previous studies of negative-energy scattering to the multichannel case, accounting for the interplay of Feshbach resonances, large background scattering lengths, and inelastic processes."
D1-1595	 Biological evolution continues to shape life on Earth, as species adapt and respond to their environment, often over extended periods. This process, driven by natural selection, allows the fittest organisms to survive and produce offspring, passing on advantageous traits. On the cosmic scale, exoplanets and their potential for hosting life remain a fascinating mystery, with astronomers searching for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of their stars. Their discoveries expand our understanding of the universe and the conditions necessary for life to evolve. As we explore these realms, the quest for understanding the origins of life, the evolutionary trajectories of planets, and the diversity of life throughout the universe, continues to captivate scientists, philosophers, and thinkers alike.
D1-1596	CREME96 and GEANT4 are two well known particle transport codes through matter in space science. We present a comparison between the proton fluxes outgoing from an aluminium target, obtained by using both tools. The primary proton flux is obtained by CREME96 only, covering an energy range from MeV to hundreds GeV with the same result in both cases. We studied different thickness targets and two different GEANT4 physics lists in order to show how the spectra of the outgoing proton fluxes are modified. Our findings show consistent agreement of simulation data by each tool, with regards both GEANT4 physics lists and every thickness target analysed.
D1-1597	 In the realm of relativistic physics, the speed of light maintains a constant, irrespective of the observer's frame of reference. This fundamental property, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of relativity, challenges our notion of absolute space and time. As an object approaches the speed of light, its length contracts and time slows down relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon, known as Lorentz contraction and time dilation, respectively, challenges our understanding of space and time. Additionally, Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, E=mc², encapsulates the intimate connection between mass and energy, revealing that even a small amount of mass can release a significant amount of energy. These concepts, groundbreaking in their time, continue to shape our understanding of the universe and its fundamental mechanisms.
D1-1598	We have developed prototypes of GEM-like detectors with resistive electrodes to be used as RICH photodetectors equipped with CsI photocathodes. The main advantages of these detectors are their intrinsic spark protection and possibility to operate at high gain (~10E5) in many gases including poorly quenched ones, allowing for the adoption of windowless configurations in which the radiator gas is also used in the chamber. Results of systematic studies of the resistive GEMs combined with CsI photocathodes are presented: its quantum efficiency, rate characteristics, long-term stability, etc. On the basis of the obtained results, we believe that the new detector will be a promising candidate for upgrading the ALICE RICH detector
D1-1599	 Wine, a celebrated beverage with a rich history, is fermented grape juice. It contains ethanol, flavonoids, and resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound. Resveratrol, acting as an antioxidant, may help lower the risk of heart disease, lessen the damaging effects of LDL cholesterol, and offer potential benefits against cancer and aging. The production of wine is rooted in fermentation, a process crucial to numerous industries and daily life, being the foundation for bread, beer, and cheese production. The craft of winemaking continues to evolve, with technological advancements and innovative practices contributing to the expansion and preservation of this ancient artistry.
D1-1600	The radiation damage of the positron source target for the International Linear Collider (ILC) has been studied. The displacement damage in target material due to multi-MeV photons has been calculated by combining FLUKA simulations for secondary particle production, SPECTER data for neutron displacement cross-sections and the Lindhard model for estimations of displacement damage by ions. The radiation damage of a stationary Ti6Al4V target in units of displacements per atom (dpa) has been estimated for photons from an undulator with strength 0.92 and period 1.15 cm. The calculated damage is 7 dpa. Approximately 12.5% of displacement damage result from neutrons.
D1-1601	 Proteins, essential biological macromolecules, are composed of amino acids, organized in complex structures. They serve diverse functions, from enzymes catalyzing chemical reactions to hemoglobin transporting oxygen in blood. DNA, the genetic material, is made up of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. It stores and transmits the hereditary information critical for living organisms. Photosynthesis, the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy, employs chlorophyll - a pigment that absorbs light and carbon dioxide to create glucose and oxygen. These biochemical compounds underlie the intricate web of life on our planet, exemplifying the intricate beauty of science.
D1-1602	The effect of conducting pipes on the equilibrium of intense nonaxisymmetric continuous beams of charged particles is investigated. For a cylindrical pipe and an elliptical beam, we obtain an exact closed form analytical expression for the electrostatic potential. Using a variational principle, we then explore the distortions that equilibrium beams suffer due to the conducting channel. Finally, we present an exact proof that despite the nonlinear forces acting on beams of arbitrary cross section inside conducting pipes of arbitrary shape, the density of these beams remains homogeneous and their cross sectional area remains the sa me as the one in free-space.
D1-1603	 The genesis of the Earth, over four billion years ago, saw the birth of innumerable celestial events, including the emergence of the sun, a star of immense mass, and its resultant solar radiation. This radiation, a myriad of photons, fueled the chemical reactions that led to the formation of Earth's earliest molecules, the building blocks of life. Over eons, these reactions gave rise to an intricate dance of planetary motion, governed by Kepler's laws, with Earth orbiting the sun in a harmonious, elliptical dance. The Earth's crust, in turn, evolved through the theory of plate tectonics, forming continents and oceans, and shaping the diverse landscape we know today. This inherent dynamism allowed for the development of life as we know it, setting the stage for the intricate web of biological evolution that continues to unfold. The COVID-19 pandemic, a recent reminder of the unpredictable and interconnected nature of our world, underscores the ongoing story of Earth's evolution, a tale that continues to be written in the cosmic radioactive clock of radioactive isotopes and the intricate dance of planetary motion.
D1-1604	We present results on simulations of a stock market with heterogeneous, cumulative information setup. We find a non-monotonic behaviour of traders' returns as a function of their information level. Particularly, the average informed agents underperform random traders. only the most informed agents are able to beat the market. We also study the effect of a strategy updating mechanism, when traders have the possibility of using other pieces of information than the fundamental value. These results corroborate the latter ones: it is only for the most informed player that it is rewarding to stay fundamentalist. The simulations reproduce some stylized facts of tick-by-tick stock-exchange data and globally show informational efficiency.
D1-1605	 Molecular biology uncovers the intricate machinations of viral infections, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 possess a simple, yet robust structure, replicating with alarming speed within host cells. This rapid replication, coupled with high mutation rates, enables these viruses to adapt quickly to their environment and outsmart the immune system.Understanding viral behavior is a critical step towards developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. Molecular biology tools, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), facilitate the detection and characterization of viruses, while proteomics and structural biology elucidate details about viral proteins and their interactions with host cells. By advancing our knowledge of viral infections, we can better prepare for future outbreaks and mitigate their impact on global health.
D1-1606	We experimentally study the turbulent flow between two coaxial and independently rotating cylinders. We determined the scaling of the torque with Reynolds numbers at various angular velocity ratios (Rotation numbers), and the behaviour of the wall shear stress when varying the Rotation number at high Reynolds numbers. We compare the curves with PIV analysis of the mean flow and show the peculiar role of perfect counterrotation for the emergence of organised large scale structures in the mean part of this very turbulent flow that appear in a smooth and continuous way: the transition resembles a supercritical bifurcation of the secondary mean flow.
D1-1607	 Photon particles, fundamental carriers of light, are integral to the intricate dance of energy in the universe. Their behavior, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like properties, encapsulates the mystifying realm of quantum physics. Beyond illuminating our world, these massless entities also penetrate deeper, offering insight into the core structure of stars and galaxies through their role in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. As we unravel the enigmatic tapestry of photon behavior, we continue to expand our knowledge of the cosmos, shedding light on the very essence of the universe itself.
D1-1608	We investigate the use of Kelly's strategy in the construction of an optimal portfolio of assets. For lognormally distributed asset returns, we derive approximate analytical results for the optimal investment fractions in various settings. We show that when mean returns and volatilities of the assets are small and there is no risk-free asset, the Kelly-optimal portfolio lies on Markowitz Efficient Frontier. Since in the investigated case the Kelly approach forbids short positions and borrowing, often only a small fraction of the available assets is included in the Kelly-optimal portfolio. This phenomenon, that we call condensation, is studied analytically in various model scenarios.
D1-1609	 Photons, weightless particles of light, shape the visible world around us. Meanwhile, the Earth's crust is placidly deceptive, masking the dynamic plates beneath, driven by the fluid asthenosphere. Thalidomide, once thought a gentle remedy, has a sinister past, linked to mass birth defects in the 1950s and 60s. A dark chapter in pharmaceutical history, it serves as a stark reminder of unforeseen consequences in scientific advancement. Kepler's laws illuminate planetary motion, while biological evolution provides the backbone of science's understanding of life's journey. Stoichiometry, the mathematical mapping of chemical reactions, offers a quantitative understanding of the world's composition. Yet, the question of daily egg consumption remains debated, while alcohol's health risks are well documented. Artificial sweeteners provide sugar alternatives, but their long-term effects remain uncertain. Coral reefs, vibrant underwater metropolises, are threatened by human activities. As we grapple with the origin of life on Earth, we also face the emergence of new challenges, like the COVID-19 pandemic, a global health crisis demanding our collective attention and scientific ingenuity.
D1-1610	Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) have recently been recognized as an important future technique for microelectronics. Such SPPs have been studied using classical theory. However, current state-of-the-art experiments are rapidly approaching nanoscales, and quantum effects can then become important. Here we study the properties of quantum SPPs at the interface between an electron quantum plasma and a dielectric material. It is shown that the effect of quantum broadening of the transition layer is most important. In particular, the damping of SPPs does not vanish even in the absence of collisional dissipation, thus posing a fundamental size limit for plasmonic devices. Consequences and applications of our results are pointed out.
D1-1611	 Biological evolution, a continuous process shaping the diversity of life, is the gradual change in populations of organisms over generations. This transformation arises from genetic variation and natural selection, where traits advantageous for survival and reproduction become more prevalent.Just as Darwin's finches demonstrated adaptation to varied environments on the Galapagos islands, so do bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance in response to drug exposure, posing ongoing challenges for healthcare.Similarly, the development of cancer cells within organisms can be seen as an accelerated evolutionary process, where cells gain mutations that allow them to proliferate unchecked and evade the body's immune system.Moreover, CRISPR gene editing, a powerful tool borrowed from the bacteria's own adaptive responses, has revolutionized our ability to influence and manipulate the course of evolution, holding exciting possibilities for future generations.
D1-1612	Experimental program review in our field may benefit from a more quantitative framework within which to quantitatively discuss the scientific merit of a proposed program of research, and to assess the scientific merit of a particular experimental result. This article proposes explicitly such a quantitative framework. Examples of the use of this framework in assessing the scientific merit of particular avenues of research at the energy frontier in many cases provide results in stark contradiction to accepted wisdom. The experimental scientific figure of merit proposed here has the potential for informing future choices of research direction in our field, and in other subfields of the physical sciences.
D1-1613	 General relativity, a theory developed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the universe. It postulates that massive objects, like planets and stars, cause a distortion in spacetime, affecting the path of other celestial objects. This fabric-like structure, where the geometry and the presence of matter are intertwined, is the foundation for the movement of galaxies, black holes, and even light itself. Today, general relativity forms a cornerstone in our exploration of the cosmos, as we continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe and our place within it.
D1-1614	On the micro- and nanoscale, classical hydrodynamic boundary conditions such as the no-slip condition no longer apply. Instead, the flow profiles exhibit ``slip`` at the surface, which is characterized by a finite slip length (partial slip). We present a new, systematic way of implementing partial-slip boundary conditions with arbitrary slip length in coarse-grained computer simulations. The main idea is to represent the complex microscopic interface structure by a spatially varying effective viscous force. An analytical equation for the resulting slip length can be derived for planar and for curved surfaces. The comparison with computer simulations of a DPD (dissipative particle dynamics) fluid shows that this expression is valid from full-slip to no-slip.
D1-1615	 Red wine, rich in polyphenols, particularly resveratrol, is frequently associated with potential health benefits. Studies suggest that moderate consumption may contribute to heart health by improving blood flow, reducing LDL cholesterol, and preventing blood clots. However, excessive intake can lead to alcohol-related issues.Resveratrol, a antioxidant found in red wine, is thought to combat oxidative stress and inflammation, which are contributing factors in heart disease and aging. Yet, more research is needed to fully understand these benefits and to clarify the optimum amount for consumption.It's also important to note that other factors, such as diet, exercise, and genetic predisposition, play a significant role in heart health. Moderate consumption of red wine, when combined with a balanced lifestyle, may offer additional heart health benefits, but it should not be seen as a substitute for a healthy lifestyle.
D1-1616	"Functionalization of carbon nanotubes with hydrosoluble porphyrins (TPPS) is achieved by ""$\pi$-stacking"". The porphyrin/nanotube interaction is studied by means of optical absorption, photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopies. The main absorption line of the porphyrins adsorbed on nanotubes exhibits a 120 meV red shift, which we ascribe to a flattening of the molecule in order to optimize $\pi-\pi$ interactions. The porphyrin-nanotube complex shows a strong quenching of the TPPS emission while the photoluminescence intensity of the nanotubes is enhanced when the excitation laser is in resonance with the porphyrin absorption band. This reveals an efficient excitation transfer from the TPPS to the carbon nanotube."
D1-1617	 Molecules of life, the building blocks of all biological organisms, are intricate structures that perform a myriad of functions. DNA, the genetic material, is a helix of nucleotides, each containing a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base. Proteins, the workhorses of the cell, are chains of amino acids, each with a unique atomic structure. Water, a universal solvent, is essential for biochemical reactions, maintaining cellular structure, and regulating body temperature. These three compounds, DNA, proteins, and water, form the basis for all life on Earth, serving as the molecular foundation for the intricate dance of life.
D1-1618	We show that nuclear motion of Rydberg atoms can be induced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions that trigger the energy transfer between two energetically close Rydberg states. How and if the atoms move depends on their initial arrangement as well as on the initial electronic excitation. Using a mixed quantum/classical propagation scheme we obtain the trajectories and kinetic energies of atoms, initially arranged in a regular chain and prepared in excitonic eigenstates. The influence of off-diagonal disorder on the motion of the atoms is examined and it is shown that irregularity in the arrangement of the atoms can lead to an acceleration of the nuclear dynamics.
D1-1619	 Coral reefs, akin to vibrant underwater metropolises, teem with an array of life forms, making them the most biodiverse marine environments. They harbor up to 30% of all marine species, providing shelter and sustenance to countless organisms. Yet, these intricate ecosystems face an imminent threat: climate change. Warmer ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, leading to the expulsion of symbiotic algae and the eventual death of the coral. Increased acidity due to carbon dioxide absorption weakens coral structures, further exacerbating the situation. Consequently, the loss of coral reefs would disrupt the livelihoods of millions who rely on them for food, income, and protective coastal barriers. To protect these vital ecosystems, it's crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices for a future where corals continue to flourish.
D1-1620	When one deals with data drawn from continuous variables, a histogram is often inadequate to display their probability density. It deals inefficiently with statistical noise, and binsizes are free parameters. In contrast to that, the empirical cumulative distribution function (obtained after sorting the data) is parameter free. But it is a step function, so that its differentiation does not give a smooth probability density. Based on Fourier series expansion and Kolmogorov tests, we introduce a simple method, which overcomes this problem. Error bars on the estimated probability density are calculated using a jackknife method. We give several examples and provide computer code reproducing them. You may want to look at the corresponding figures 4 to 9 first.
D1-1621	 The Sun's photons relentlessly stream across the cosmos, their journeys playing a pivotal role in the formation and evolution of diverse stellar systems. Meanwhile, planet Earth endures its own tumultuous dance, shaped by the Earth-Sun system's gravitational interplay and the cyclic rhythm of climatic oscillations. These sub-centurial shifts, akin to the Sun's heartbeat, dictate the global climate's intricate ebb and flow, influencing both the slow and swift transformations experienced by our planet's various ecosystems.One such ecosystem, the coral reef, thrives at the edge of the oceanic abyss, showcasing a breathtaking parade of life. Yet, these vibrant underwater gardens face unprecedented challenges from the mercurial climate. As the planet's temperature fluctuates due to these oscillations, coral reefs, which depend on specific water temperatures, are susceptible to bleaching events that can lead to their demise.The pulsating dance of our planet with the Sun, coupled with the rhythmic shifts of climatic oscillations, paints a complex portrait of our existence. This intricate dance, while inviting awe, also underscores the need for vigilance and understanding, as our planet's delicate balance hangs in the balance.
D1-1622	Tabrizi et al. [physics/0701342] discuss the feasibility of an electron-based crystal undulator (e-CU) by planar channeling of 50 GeV electrons through a periodically bent crystal. We show that their scheme is not feasible. First, their undulator parameter is K >> 1 always, which destroys photon interference. Second, they overestimate the electron dechanneling length in e-CU by an order of magnitude, which shortens the number N of e-CU periods from 5-15 (as they hope) to just 1-2. This kills their e-CU concept again. We made first simulation of electron channeling in undulated crystal and conclude that an electron-based crystal wiggler is feasible with wiggler strength K=10 and number of periods N=2.
D1-1623	 Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where particles become interconnected and actions on one instantly affect the other, regardless of distance, is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics. This **spooky action at a distance** challenges our classical understanding of the world. A quantum bit, or qubit, is the fundamental unit of quantum information, capable of existing in multiple states at once, thanks to a property known as superposition. This quantum property allows for exponentially more processing power compared to classical bits. However, maintaining multiple states simultaneously introduces challenges in quantum computation, leading to the need for advanced error correction techniques. The study of quantum mechanics continues to challenge our perception of reality and promises revolutionary advancements in technology.
D1-1624	A toy detector has been designed to simulate central detectors in reactor neutrino experiments in the paper. The electron samples from the Monte-Carlo simulation of the toy detector have been reconstructed by the method of Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and the standard algorithm, a maximum likelihood method (MLD), respectively. The result of the event reconstruction using BNN has been compared with the one using MLD. Compared to MLD, the uncertainties of the electron vertex are not improved, but the energy resolutions are significantly improved using BNN. And the improvement is more obvious for the high energy electrons than the low energy ones.
D1-1625	 Photosynthesis is a process harnessed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converting light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process occurs within chloroplasts, with carbon dioxide and water as primary raw materials. It is essential for life on Earth, as it fuels the food chain and releases oxygen, a key component beneficial for most aerobic organisms. However, the extent of photosynthesis efficiency and its influence on global climate remain topics of ongoing research, as an increase in photosynthetic productivity might mitigate the effects of climate change, while decreased efficiency could exacerbate it.
D1-1626	We demonstrate an all-optical bump-on-tail instability by considering the nonlinear interaction of two partially-coherent spatial beams. For weak wave coupling, we observe momentum transfer with no variation in intensity. For strong wave coupling, modulations appear in intensity and evidence appears for wave (Langmuir) collapse at large scales. Borrowing plasma language, these limits represent regimes of weak and strong spatial optical turbulence. In both limits, the internal spectral energy redistribution is observed by recording and reconstructing a hologram of the evolving dynamics. The results are universal and can appear in any wave-kinetic system with short-wave/long-wave coupling.
D1-1627	 Atoms, the building blocks of matter, are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside at the nucleus, while electrons whirl around it in defined energy levels. The atomic structure determines the element's chemical behavior. For instance, hydrogen, with just one proton in its nucleus and one electron orbiting, behaves very differently from carbon, which has six protons and up to six electrons in its outermost energy level. These differences in atomic structure allow for the wide variety of chemical reactions that form the basis of life. Understanding these intricacies continues to drive scientific discovery and technological advancement.
D1-1628	Many difficult computational problems involve the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple constraints which are individually easy to satisfy. Such problems occur in diffractive imaging, protein folding, constrained optimization (e.g., spin glasses), and satisfiability testing. We present a simple geometric framework to express and solve such problems and apply it to two benchmarks. In the first application (3SAT, a boolean satisfaction problem), the resulting method exhibits similar performance scaling as a leading context-specific algorithm (walksat). In the second application (sphere packing), the method allowed us to find improved solutions to some old and well-studied optimization problems. Based upon its simplicity and observed efficiency, we argue that this framework provides a competitive alternative to stochastic methods such as simulated annealing.
D1-1629	 In the intricate tapestry of life, natural selection emerges as the guiding force, shaping the evolution of species over time. It's the mechanism whereby organisms with advantageous traits pass these traits onto their offspring, while those with less advantageous traits are slowly phased out. This process, responsible for the breathtaking diversity of life on Earth, has its roots deeply embedded in the distant past and continues to shape the world we inhabit today.On a cosmic scale, light's fundamental particle, the photon, troves through the universe, unaltered by its journey, untouched by the passage of time. Yet, when it interacts with matter, it triggers a cascade of effects, much like natural selection, shaping the very fabric of our existence.In the midst of this cosmic dance, the Earth's plates drift apart, a stark reminder of the constant change that pervades our planet. The theory of plate tectonics, much like natural selection, provides a framework to understand and interpret the dynamic processes that shape our world.So, while the dance of photons and the drift of tectonic plates may seem unrelated, they are but two expressions of the underlying law of change that governs the universe, a law mirrored in the process of natural selection that molds life on Earth.
D1-1630	"We consider words as a network of interacting letters, and approximate the probability distribution of states taken on by this network. Despite the intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial (and arbitrary), we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the full statistics of four letter words, capturing ~92% of the multi-information among letters and even ""discovering"" real words that were not represented in the data from which the pairwise correlations were estimated. The maximum entropy model defines an energy landscape on the space of possible words, and local minima in this landscape account for nearly two-thirds of words used in written English."
D1-1631	 The Earth's lithosphere, its outer solid layer, is a dynamic and vital component of our planet. It houses tectonic plates, colossal slabs of rock, that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath. These plates constantly move, albeit slowly, causing seismic activity and fostering the formation of mountains, valleys, and oceanic trenches. This process, known as plate tectonics, significantly impacts Earth's geography, climate, and even its biology. For instance, the collision of tectonic plates led to the emergence of the Himalayan mountain range and the formation of the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean, a seismically active region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Understanding the movement and interactions of these tectonic plates is crucial for predicting natural disasters and gaining insights into the Earth's past and future.
D1-1632	The loop quantum theory, which constitutes a very small discontinuous space, as new method is applied to biology. The model of protein folding and lungs is proposed. In the model, some known results are used, and four approximate conclusions are obtained: their structures are quantized, their space regions are finite, various singularities correspond to folding and crossed points, and different types of catastrophe exist. Further, based on the inseparability and correlativity of the biological systems, the nonlinear whole biology is proposed, and four basic hypotheses are formed. It may unify reductionism and holism, structuralism and functionalism. Finally, the medical meaning of the theory is discussed briefly.
D1-1633	 Electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon manifesting in waves of varying frequencies, permeates the universe. Ranging from radio waves to gamma rays, this energy transfers information and carries heat. The photon, a fundamental particle, embodies this radiation. It is massless and travels at the speed of light, propagating through space and time in a manner independent of any material medium. The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation plays a crucial role in our daily lives, from powering wireless communication to illuminating our homes, and even holding clues to the cosmic origins of the universe.
D1-1634	A 1-D linear gyrokinetic code called AWECS is developed to study the kinetic excitation of Alfvenic instabilities in a high-beta tokamak plasma, with beta being the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. It is designed to describe physics associated with a broad range of frequencies and wavelengths. For example, AWECS is capable of simulating kinetic ballooning modes, Alfvenic ion-temperature-gradient-driven modes, as well as Alfven instabilities due to energetic particles. In addition, AWECS may be used to study drift-Alfven instabilities in the low-beta regime. Here, the layout of the code and the numerical methods used are described. AWECS is benchmarked against other codes and a convergence study is carried out.
D1-1635	 In the realm of physics and chemistry, reaction rates reign supreme as a fundamental concept. These rates dictate the speed at which chemical reactions occur, vital for myriad processes in our world. For instance, the combustion of fuel in a car engine, the decomposition of atmospheric ozone, or the fermentation of grapes for wine-making – all are dictated by reaction rates. The factors influencing these rates, such as temperature, concentration, and catalyst presence, significantly impact countless natural and industrial processes. Moreover, understanding these rates is paramount for optimizing the efficiency of reactions, thereby reducing waste and energy consumption, and fostering sustainable practices.
D1-1636	The surface roughness of a recently exhumed strikeslip fault plane has been measured by three independent 3D portable laser scanners. Digital elevation models of several fault surface areas, from 1 m2 to 600 m2, have been measured at a resolution ranging from 5 mm to 80 mm. Out of plane height fluctuations are described by non-Gaussian distribution with exponential long range tails. Statistical scaling analyses show that the striated fault surface exhibits self-affine scaling invariance with a small but significant directional morphological anisotropy that can be described by two scaling roughness exponents, H1 = 0.7 in the direction of slip and H2 = 0.8 perpendicular to the direction of slip.
D1-1637	 Photons, the massless particles of light, illuminate our world, yet the debate persists on another kind of light - cholesterol. Consumed primarily in food, their excess is a health concern. This lipid molecule is crucial for cell membranes, hormone production, and vitamin absorption, yet its overconsumption can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, potentially causing heart disease.Evolution, like a grand cosmic dance, has shaped life on Earth, yet the transformation in our diets, fueled by agriculture and industry, has led to an imbalance. The question of how many eggs one should eat daily remains debated, as the cholesterol content raises concerns for some, while others believe it's a necessary part of a balanced diet for its various benefits. The scientific community continues to study the nuances of cholesterol, seeking answers to alleviate this ongoing debate.On the other hand, the origin of life on Earth, an age-old question, remains shrouded in mystery. In the interim, life continues to evolve, and our understanding of it deepens. As we unravel the threads of life's history, perhaps we will find answers to the questions that surround us - including the cholesterol conundrum.
D1-1638	We present a method to distinguish the high harmonics generated in individual half-cycle of the driving laser pulse by mixing a weak ultraviolet pulse, enabling one to observe the cutoff of each half-cycle harmonic. We show that the detail information of the driving laser pulse, including the laser intensity, pulse duration and carrier-envelope phase, can be {\it in situ} retrieved from the harmonic spectrogram. In addition, our results show that this method also distinguishes the half-cycle high harmonics for a pulse longer than 10 fs, suggesting a potential to extend the CEP measurement to the multi-cycle regime.
D1-1639	 Artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and sucralose, are non-nutritive alternatives to sugar, providing sweetness without the calories. They are derived from various chemical compounds, with saccharin being one of the oldest, first synthesized in 1879. These substitutes are widely used in food and beverage industries to cater to health-conscious consumers. However, despite being low in calories, their long-term health effects are not yet fully understood. More research is needed to determine the potential impacts of these substances on metabolism, gut microbiota, and overall health. Meanwhile, moderation in their use is advised to ensure a balanced diet.
D1-1640	An acoustic field is used to increase the critical heat flux (CHF) of a flat-boiling-heat-transfer surface. The increase is a result of the acoustic effects on the vapor bubbles. Experiments are performed to explore the effects of an acoustic field on vapor bubbles in the vicinity of a rigid-heated wall. Work includes the construction of a novel heater used to produce a single vapor bubble of a prescribed size and at a prescribed location on a flatboiling surface for better study of an individual vapor bubble's reaction to the acoustic field. Work also includes application of the results from the single-bubble heater to a calibrated-copper heater used for quantifying the improvements in CHF.
D1-1641	 Phosphorescent bioluminescence, a spectacle of nature, occurs when certain organisms emit light, showcasing the fascinating interplay between chemistry and physics. This light emission, driven by chemical reactions, hints at the intriguing possibility of early life forms utilizing similar processes during abiogenesis – the spontaneous formation of life from non-living matter. Theories suggest that such reactions could have harnessed energy from the sun via photons, much like how modern-day photosynthesis does. These photons, the mass-less particles of light, may have played a pivotal role in shaping the earliest stages of life on our planet. Yet, abiogenesis remains one of science's enduring mysteries, as understanding its intricacies could unveil the cosmic origins of life itself, opening doors to exploring extraterrestrial life forms and the potential for life beyond Earth.
D1-1642	"We present a simple, two dimensional example of a ""cat"" -- a body with zero angular momentum that can rotate itself with no external forces. This model is used to explain why this problem is known to be a gauge theory and to illustrate the importance of non-commutative operators. We will also show a comparison between the free-space ""cat"" in Newtonian mechanics and the same problem in Aristotelian mechanics at low Reynolds number. this simple example shows the analogy between (angular) momentum in Newtonian mechanics and (torque) force in Aristotelian mechanics. We will end by pointing out a topological invariant common to our model in free space and at low Reynolds number."
D1-1643	 The COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis, emerged in late 2019, originating in Wuhan, China. Its cause? A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, a member of the larger coronavirus family that often infect animals before jumping to humans. Known as zoonotic transmission, it's a regular occurrence but one that's particularly challenging to predict. The virus exploited an opportunity to spread rapidly due to the growing urbanization, air travel, and human population density. This pandemic underscores the urgent need for continued research and preparedness, not just for SARS-CoV-2, but for future zoonotic diseases as well. Therefore, understanding the interface between humans, animals, and their environments remains a crucial aspect of managing pandemics and maintaining global health security.
D1-1644	In this investigation, the numerical simulation of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) ion-drag micropumps with micropillar electrode geometries have been performed. The effect of micropillar height and electrode spacing on the performance of the micropumps was investigated. The performance of the EHD micropump improved with increased applied voltage and decreased electrode spacing. The optimum micropillar height for the micropump with electrode spacing of 40$\mu$m and channel height of 100$\mu$m at 200V was 40$\mu$m, where a maximum mass flow rate of 0.18g/min was predicted. Compared to that of planar electrodes, the 3D micropillar electrode geometry enhanced the overall performance of the EHD micropumps.
D1-1645	 In thermodynamics, the second law governs the transfer of heat between systems, establishing that energy tends to dissipate and become unavailable for work. This law helps explain the inevitable increase in entropy, or disorder, within a closed system. For instance, the burning of fossil fuels, like coal or oil, releases energy in the form of heat, yet much of this energy is wasted as the system moves towards a state of maximum entropy. This process is the basis for understanding climate change, as the release of greenhouse gases from human activities raises the Earth's temperature, leading to far-reaching environmental and ecological consequences. Thus, understanding thermodynamics is crucial for addressing global climate concerns, as we strive to develop sustainable energy solutions that minimize waste and entropy increase.
D1-1646	We demonstrate the capabilities of a high temperature measurement set-up recently developed at our institute. It is dedicated to the characterization of semiconductor devices and test structures in the temperature range from room temperature up to 500 degrees C and higher. A detailed description of the experimental aquipment is given. Its practical use is demonstrated by measuring temperature-dependent charcteristics of silicon VDMOSFET and IGBT devices as well as SiC-diodes. For the silicon devices, numerical simulations based on recently developed high temperature physical models were also performed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the measured data, together with a revalidation of the model parameters.
D1-1647	 Protein synthesis is a crucial biological process, the machinery of life, constructing essential protein molecules from amino acids. It's a complex dance of three interconnected stages: transcription, translation, and post-translational modification. In transcription, DNA serves as a template, RNA polymerase creating a messenger RNA (mRNA) copy. During translation, the mRNA moves into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes decode the sequence, stringing together amino acids in the order specified, forming a polypeptide, or protein. Post-translational modifications further shape and activate the protein, equipping it for its specific role within the cell. Understanding this process is key to unlocking numerous biological mysteries, from disease mechanisms to the fundamentals of life itself.
D1-1648	"The flexible profile approach proposed earlier to create CTM (compact or reduced order thermal models) is extended to cover the area of conjugate heat transfer. The flexible profile approach is a methodology that allows building a highly boundary conditions independent CTM, with any desired degree of accuracy, that may adequately replace detailed 3D models for the whole spectrum of applications in which the modeled object may be used. The extension to conjugate problems radically solves the problem of interfacing two different domains. Each domain, fluid or solid, can be ""compacted"" independently creating two CTM that can be joined together to produce reliable results for any arbitrary set of external boundary conditions."
D1-1649	 Carbohydrates, a primary energy source, undergo breakdown through a series of metabolic processes. Glycolysis, occurring in the cell's cytoplasm, splits glucose molecules into pyruvate, yielding ATP and NADH. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria, where it is further oxidized and generates more ATP, carbon dioxide, and reduced coenzymes. This intricate chain of reactions efficiently harnesses the energy stored in carbohydrates for cellular purposes. Understanding these processes is crucial in various fields, from nutrition to biotechnology, as it offers insight into the inner workings of life at a cellular level.
D1-1650	From a scale analysis of hydrodynamic phenomena having a significant action on the drift of an object in coastal ocean waters, we deduce equations modeling the associated hydrodynamic fields over a time period of several weeks. These models are essentially non linear hyperbolic systems of PDE involving a small parameter. Then from the models we extract a simplified and nevertheless typical one for which we prove that its classical solution exists on a time interval which is independent of the small parameter. We then show that the solution weak-* converges as the small parameter goes to zero and we characterize the equation satisfied by the weak-* limit
D1-1651	 In the realm of virology, a virus is a nanometer-sized infectious agent that replicates inside living cells. In comparison to cells, viruses are acellular and do not possess the mechanism for self-replication, instead hijacking the host cell's machinery to produce more viral particles.Viral evolution plays a crucial role in their survival and adaptation. Through processes like mutation, recombination, and natural selection, viruses can change over time to evade host defenses, become more transmissible, or develop resistance to antiviral drugs.This evolution can lead to viral outbreaks, as seen in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for this pandemic, originated in bats and then jumped to humans, sparking a global health crisis.As we continue to study viruses, understanding their evolution and the factors that drive it can help us better predict and respond to future outbreaks, ultimately protecting human health and well-being.
D1-1652	A generalization of non-perturbative QED model for high harmonic generation is developed for the multi-mode optical field case. By introducing classical-field-dressed quantized Volkov states analytically, a formula to calculate HHG for hydrogen-like atom in ultrashort intense laser pulse is obtained, which has a simple intuitive interpretation. The dressed state QED model indicates a new perspective to understand HHG, for example, the presence of the weak even-order harmonic photons, which has been verified by both theoretical analysis and numerical computation. Long wavelength approximation and strong field approximation are involved in the development of the formalism.
D1-1653	 In the realm of physics, Einstein's theory of General Relativity revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos. This revolutionary theory described gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. This means that a massive object like the Sun warps the space around it, causing planets to move along curved paths, a concept beautifully illustrated in Kepler's laws of planetary motion.On a smaller scale, this warping of space-time also has profound effects on light. As light travels through space, it follows the curvature of space-time, causing it to bend or 'bend around' massive objects, an effect known as gravitational lensing. This phenomenon has been used to study distant galaxies and black holes, shedding light on the mysterious corners of the universe.Thus, Einstein's theory of General Relativity continues to shape our understanding of the universe, offering a profound insight into the interconnectedness of all things. It serves as a testament to the power of human curiosity and the transformative potential of scientific discovery.
D1-1654	A detailed analysis of the most relevant sources of phase noise in an atomic interferometer is carried out, both theoretically and experimentally. Even a short interrogation time of 100 ms allows our cold atom gravimeter to reach an excellent short term sensitivity to acceleration of $1.4\times 10^{-8}$g at 1s. This result relies on the combination of a low phase noise laser system, efficient detection scheme and good shielding from vibrations. In particular, we describe a simple and robust technique of vibration compensation, which is based on correcting the interferometer signal by using the AC acceleration signal measured by a low noise seismometer.
D1-1655	 Marine bioluminescence, a mesmerizing spectacle in the depths of the ocean, occurs when certain marine creatures emit light in response to stimuli. Bioluminescence is a result of a chemical reaction involving the enzyme luciferin and an oxygen molecule in the presence of a luciferase enzyme. The flash of light can serve various purposes, such as attracting prey, deterring predators, or communicating with other organisms. The fascinating world of marine bioluminescence opens doors to understanding the complexity and adaptability of life under the sea. Exploring this phenomenon further could lead to new insights into biochemical processes, potential applications in medicine, and conservation efforts aimed at preserving the mystery and beauty of our oceans.
D1-1656	In this paper we employ all-electron time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to calculate the long range dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of alkali-metal atoms Li, Na, K, alkali-metal atom dimers Li$_{2}$, Na$_{2}$, K$_{2}$ and sodium clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms. The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder expression which relates it to the frequency dependent linear polarizabilty at imaginary frequencies. The frequency dependent polarizabilities are calculated by employing TDDFT--based complete sum-over-states expressions for the atoms, and direct TDDFT linear response theory for the closed shell dimers and clusters.
D1-1657	 Drug development, often a delicate dance between science and humanity, aims to create medications that alleviate suffering and extend lives. This process involves the discovery, testing, and approval of new pharmaceutical substances, such as aspirin derived from willow bark, penicillin discovered in mold, or the antiviral remdesivir, initially developed to combat Ebola. The development of novel drugs like these requires understanding molecular structures, their interactions with biological systems, and the intricate dance of trial and error. However, the journey from lab bench to pharmacy is long, challenging, and fraught with uncertainty due to factors like potential side effects, the need for clinical trials, and regulatory hurdles. Despite these challenges, the relentless pursuit of new drugs continues, as we strive to conquer diseases and improve the quality of human life.
D1-1658	We analyze the multifractal spectra of daily foreign exchange rates for Japan, Hong-Kong, Korea, and Thailand with respect to the United States Dollar from 1991 to 2005. We find that the return time series show multifractal spectrum features for all four cases. To observe the effect of the Asian currency crisis, we also estimate the multifractal spectra of limited series before and after the crisis. We find that the Korean and Thai foreign exchange markets experienced a significant increase in multifractality compared to Hong-Kong and Japan. We also show that the multifractality is stronge related to the presence of high values of returns in the series.
D1-1659	 The dynamic realm of evolution, a process shaping life over time, reveals intriguing adaptations among species. For instance, penguins, initially flightless birds, developed waterproof feathers to thrive in icy Antarctic seas. Similarly, the hooded seal, once a carnivore, has now adapted to consume squid and crab oils found in vast polar oceans.Climate change, a significant oscillation on a sub-centurial scale, has pushed many species to evolve or relocate to survive. The polar bear, for example, faces habitat loss due to melting ice caps. As a result, some bears have been observed venturing farther from their traditional habitats in search of food.The COVID-19 pandemic, of recent origin, serves as a stark reminder of our interconnectedness with nature. Zoonotic diseases, like COVID-19, often originate from animals and can spread to humans when there's close contact. Understanding these connections and promoting biodiversity conservation could help mitigate similar future outbreaks.In the grand tapestry of life, species adaptations and the factors driving them, such as climate change and pandemics, unravel the intricate story of nature's resilience and our role in it.
D1-1660	Most infrastructure networks evolve and operate in a decentralized fashion, which may adversely impact the allocation of resources across the system. Here we investigate this question by focusing on the relation between capacity and load in various such networks. We find that, due to network traffic fluctuations, real systems tend to have larger unoccupied portions of the capacities--smaller load-to-capacity ratios--on network elements with smaller capacities, which contrasts with key assumptions involved in previous studies. This finding suggests that infrastructure networks have evolved to minimize local failures but not necessarily large-scale failures that can be caused by the cascading spread of local damage.
D1-1661	 In the vast expanse of cosmos, Einstein's theory of general relativity postulates that massive objects, such as stars and planets, curve the fabric of space-time. This curvature, in turn, affects the path of any other object moving near it. This phenomenon, known as gravitation, is the attractive force that governs the movement of celestial bodies. In essence, it's like a stretched rubber sheet, where a heavy ball creates a dip that directs lighter balls towards it. It's a dance of dynamics between matter and space-time, a celestial ballet of epic proportions. This theory, a testament to the interconnectedness of our universe, continues to shape our understanding of the cosmos, from the birth of stars to the journey of black holes.
D1-1662	We compare the experimental data of the first measurement of a temperature dependence of the Casimir-Polder force by Obrecht et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 063201 (2007)] with the theory taking into account small, but physically real, static conductivity of the dielectric substrate. The theory is found to be inconsistent with the data. The conclusion is drawn that the conductivity of dielectric materials should not be included in the model of the dielectric response in the Lifshitz theory. This conclusion obtained from the long separation measurement is consistent with related but different results obtained for semiconductors and metals at short separations.
D1-1663	 The photon, a massless particle of light, illuminates our world, enabling sight and powering countless technologies. Meanwhile, the science of general relativity, proposed by Einstein, unveils the intricate dance of celestial bodies, including the Sun and planets, in their gravitational ballet. Yet, amidst this cosmic spectacle, a darker issue emerges: alcohol, a substance deeply interwoven in human culture. No level of alcohol consumption is entirely safe for health, as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). Instead, it's a risk that impacts both individuals and societies, fueling a complex web of health concerns, including cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis, and an increased risk of various types of cancers. As we continue to explore the universe and unlock its secrets, we also vie for a world where human health takes center stage.
D1-1664	"Few-cycle pulses of intense 800 nm light are used to probe ionization and dissociation of carbon disulfide in the intensity and temporal regime where rescattering is expected to dominate the laser-molecule interaction. The wavepacket of the rescattered electron destructively interferes with the anti-bonding $\pi$-orbital of CS$_2^+$ such that rescattering is effectively ""switched off"". Direct signature of enhanced ionization being ""switched off"" in the ultrashort domain is also obtained. Consequently, dissociation becomes an almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used, with only long-lived singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the mass spectrum. Few-cycle optical pulses help reveal that quantum-mechanically determined molecular symmetry contributes to strong field molecular ionization."
D1-1665	 Electromagnetic waves, pulsating through the cosmos, transmit information crucial for life on Earth - from radio waves guiding navigation to visible light enabling photosynthesis. Yet, human activities are disrupting this delicate balance. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise, known as global warming. This environmental shift is accelerating melting ice caps, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. Climate change also affects the delicate equilibrium of coral reefs, leading to coral bleaching and biodiversity loss, dismantling the intricate ecosystems that support marine life. Thus, harnessing renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical to preserving our planet for future generations.
D1-1666	The elementary structures of turbulence, i.e., vortex tubes, are studied using velocity data obtained in laboratory experiments for boundary layers and duct flows at microscale Reynolds numbers 332-1934. While past experimental studies focused on intense vortex tubes, the present study focuses on all vortex tubes with various intensities. We obtain the mean velocity profile. The radius scales with the Kolmogorov length. The circulation velocity scales with the Kolmogorov velocity, in contrast to the case of intense vortex tubes alone where the circulation velocity scales with the rms velocity fluctuation. Since these scaling laws are independent of the configuration for turbulence production, they appear to be universal at high Reynolds numbers.
D1-1667	 Photons, the massless particles of light, travel at the speed of light and exhibit wave-particle duality, forming the basis of electromagnetic radiation. In the cosmic arena, these particles contribute to oscillation patterns, such as the pulsars' regular pulses or the light fluctuations in quasars. On a larger scale, the theory of plate tectonics posits that the Earth's lithosphere is in a constant state of motion, with tectonic plates shifting and colliding, resulting in seismic activity and mountain-building over millions of years. This is an excellent example of long-term oscillation patterns on our planet. Similarly, biological evolution introduces oscillations in species populations, as they adapt and change over time, resulting in biodiversity cycles. On a smaller scale, the study of biology reveals intricate oscillation patterns in cellular processes, such as the cell cycle that governs cell growth and division. Ultimately, understanding these oscillation patterns can help us comprehend the intricate dance of energy, matter, and life on our planet and beyond.
D1-1668	A painting consists of objects which are arranged in specific ways. The art of painting is drawing the objects, which can be considered as known trends, in an expressive manner. Detrended methods are suitable for characterizing the artistic works of the painter by eliminating trends. It means that we study the paintings, regardless of its apparent purpose, as a stochastic process. We apply multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the statistical properties of Mona Lisa, as an instance, to exhibit the fractality of the painting. Our results show that Mona Lisa is long range correlated and almost behaves similar in various scales.
D1-1669	 Quantum entanglement, a fascinating phenomenon, links particles instantaneously, irrespective of distance. Two or more particles become entangled, their states interconnected, such that the measurement of one particle's state instantly determines the state of the others. This defies classical notions of causality and has significant implications for quantum computing and cryptography.For instance, imagine entangled photons, particles of light, each encoding a bit of information. Separated by vast distances, measuring one photon would instantaneously reveal the state of the other, enabling super-fast communication or secure quantum computing.Furthermore, this entanglement persists, even when particles are light-years apart, challenging our understanding of space, time, and the very fabric of reality. This mysterious bond could potentially revolutionize our technologies, paving the way for a new era of innovation in quantum science.
D1-1670	We investigate directly at the microscale the morphology of the electrowetting induced transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states for a water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. Our experiments demonstrate that the transition originates in a very narrow annular region near the macroscopic contact line, which is first invaded by water and causes a thin film of air to be entrapped below. At high applied voltages, a growing fraction of microscopic air-pockets collapse, resulting in a partialWenzel state. Modulations in the intensity of the light reflected from individual micro-menisci clarify that the local contact angles near the filling transition are close to the usual advancing values for contact lines on smooth surfaces.
D1-1671	 The dynamic process of cell division, known as mitosis, underpins growth and reproduction in all living organisms. This intricate dance of chromosomes and dividing cytoplasm forms the foundation for the emergence of new cells, a pivotal aspect in our bodies' health and development. Each cell, born from this meticulous process, carries within it a blueprint of genetic information that shapes its destiny, echoing the cosmic principles that govern the universe in the form of photons, particles of light. It's a mesmerizing interplay of biology and physics, a testament to the intricate and interconnected nature of life and the universe.
D1-1672	The peculiarity of the distribution and geometry of metallic ions in enzymes pushed us to set the hypothesis that metallic ions in active-site act like tiny antennas able to pick up very feeble e.m. signals. Enzymatic activity of Cu2+, Zn2+ Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) and Fe2+ Xanthine Oxidase (XO) has been studied, following in vitro generation and removal of free radicals. We observed that Superoxide radicals generation by XO is increased by a weak field having the Larmor frequency fL of Fe2+ while the SOD1 kinetics is sensibly reduced by exposure to a weak field having the frequency fL of Cu2+ ion.
D1-1673	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, engage in intricate dances of interaction to form the intricate tapestry of chemistry. This interplay of atoms determines the properties of materials, from the stiff structure of a diamond to the fluidity of water. Bonds formed between molecules can be covalent, ionic, hydrogen, or van der Waals, each with its unique strength and character. In biology, these interactions govern the function of proteins and DNA, the building blocks of life, and determine the behavior of cells and organisms. The study of these interactions, known as molecular biology, sheds light on the inner workings of life and offers potential avenues for medical breakthroughs.
D1-1674	The study deals with a rotor-stator contact inducing vibration in rotating machinery. A numerical rotor-stator system, including a non-linear bearing with Hertz contact and clearance is considered. To determine the non-linear responses of this system, non-linear dynamic equations can be integrated numerically. However, this procedure is both time consuming and costly to perform. The aim of this Note is to apply the Alternate Frequency/Time Method and the 'path following continuation' in order to obtain the non-linear responses to this problem. Then the orbits of rotor and stator responses at various speeds are investigated.
D1-1675	 Orbiting celestial bodies intrigue us, their movements dictated by the laws of Kepler and Newton. Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of orbital mechanics, describing the motion of planets, moons, and artificial satellites in our solar system. These laws allow us to predict the paths of objects in space, enabling complex missions like landing rovers on Mars and probes on distant comets. Yet, the vastness and intricacy of the cosmos leave us questioning the possibilities of life beyond our planet, fueling ongoing investigations in astrobiology. As we unravel celestial mysteries, we also grapple with another paradox: the fragility of Earth's only known habitable environment, as evidenced in the devastating effects of climate change and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the pursuit of understanding orbital mechanics melds with the search for life and the struggle to protect our home planet.
D1-1676	In the perspective of the outstanding developments of high-precision measurements of fundamental constants using polar molecules related to ultimate checks of fundamental theories, we investigate the possibly counterproductive role of black-body radiation on a series of diatomic molecules which would be trapped and observed for long durations. We show that the absorption of black-body radiation at room temperature may indeed limit the lifetime of trapped molecules prepared in a well-defined quantum state. Several examples are treated, corresponding to pure rotational absorption, pure vibrational absorption or both. We also investigate the role of a black-body radiation-induced energy shift on molecular levels and how it could affect high-precision frequency measurements.
D1-1677	 Pharmaceutical evolution has seen the emergence of revolutionary treatments, such as penicillin, discovered by Fleming in the 1920s. Later, sulfa drugs, developed in the 1930s, marked a major milestone in antibiotic history. Fast forward to the 1950s, and we have the infamous Thalidomide tragedy, a sleeping pill linked to birth defects, highlighting the need for rigorous testing before drug approval. The 90s brought us SSRIs, like Prozac, revolutionizing mental health treatment. Today, mRNA technology, pioneered by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, is redefining vaccination efforts, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the pharmaceutical landscape continues to evolve, with researchers constantly striving to address unmet medical needs and improve global health outcomes.
D1-1678	We present fully empirical exchange-correlation functionals to be used within reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT). These are of the popular J-K form, where the function of the occupation numbers that multiplies the Fock orbital term is written as a Pade approximant. The coefficients of the Pade are optimized for a testset of eight molecules, and then refined for a larger set of 35 molecules. Two different approaches were tried, either keeping the self-interaction terms, or by removing them explicitly from the functional. The functionals thus obtained involve very few parameters, but are able to outperform other RDMFT functionals, yielding correlation energies that are, on average, even slightly better than Moeller-Plesset MP2 theory.
D1-1679	 Genetic drift, a random change in the frequency of an allele within a population, plays a crucial role in evolution. Unlike natural selection, which is directional, genetic drift is random and can cause more rapid changes, particularly in small populations. This phenomenon was effectively demonstrated by the Svalbard reindeer, where hunting and predation drastically reduced their numbers, leading to significant genetic shifts. As a population's size decreases, even slight changes in allele frequencies can have a substantial impact, potentially driving the extinction of entire genetic lineages. Conversely, when population sizes increase, genetic diversity can be restored through genetic drift, contributing to a population's adaptability and resilience. This delicate balance between random genetic drift and natural selection shapes the evolution of species over time.
D1-1680	We study the dynamic behavior of ultracold neutral atoms in a macroscopic ac electric trap. Confinement in such a trap is achieved by switching between two saddle-point configurations of the electric field. The gradual formation of a stably trapped cloud is observed and the trap performance is studied versus the switching frequency and the symmetry of the switching cycle. Additionally, the electric field in the trap is mapped out by imaging the atom cloud while the fields are still on. Finally, the phase-space acceptance of the trap is probed by introducing a modified switching cycle. The experimental results are reproduced using full three-dimensional trajectory calculations.
D1-1681	 Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, were first directly detected in 2015. These waves propagate at the speed of light and are produced by accelerating masses, such as colliding neutron stars or black holes. They offer a new way to observe the universe, providing insights into cataclysmic events that were previously invisible. The detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized astronomy, opening a new chapter in our understanding of the cosmos. Meanwhile, the debate about the optimal intake of eggs continues, with concerns over cholesterol levels, while the origin of life on Earth remains one of science's greatest mysteries.
D1-1682	Assembly/Disassembly (A/D) simulations using haptic devices are facing difficulties while simulating insertion/extraction operations such as removing cylinders from holes. In order to address this configuration as well as others, an approach based on contact identification between components is presented in this paper. This approach can efficiently contribute either to a new A/D simulation preparation process relying on two types of shape representations (mesh and CAD NURBS models), or directly to the real time simulation process when it is performed with 6D haptic devices. The model processing pipeline is described and illustrated to show how information can be propagated and used for contact detection. Then, the contact identification process is introduced and illustrated through an example
D1-1683	" Cardiac physics delves into the mechanics of the heart, a vital organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. The heart's rhythm is regulated by electrical impulses, creating a relevant link to the biological evolution of complex organisms.At the cellular level, the myocardium, heart muscle tissue, contracts due to the influx and outflow of ions, similar to how a photon's behavior is determined by the interaction of particles and fields in the quantum realm.Heart disease, often referred to as the ""silent killer,"" is a significant global health concern. Plaque buildup in coronary arteries, caused by factors like high cholesterol, can lead to heart attacks. This highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise to reduce the risk.General relativity, Einstein's theory of gravitation, explains the force that keeps our planet spinning and maintains the gravitational pull necessary for circulatory systems to function. This interconnectedness between the cosmic and the cardiac underscores the beauty and complexity of physics in our daily lives."
D1-1684	We use the asymmetric simple exclusion process for describing vehicular traffic flow at the intersection of two streets. No traffic lights control the traffic flow. The approaching cars to the intersection point yield to each other to avoid collision. This yielding dynamics is model by implementing exclusion process to the intersection point of the two streets. Closed boundary condition is applied to the streets. We utilize both mean-field approach and extensive simulations to find the model characteristics. In particular, we obtain the fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of interaction between chains can be regarded as a dynamic impurity at the intersection point.
D1-1685	 Coral reefs, often dubbed as the 'rainforests of the sea,' are intricate, vibrant ecosystems teeming with an array of marine life. They provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for countless species, while also protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Yet, coral reefs are under threat, with climate change, overfishing, and pollution posing significant challenges. Rising ocean temperatures due to global warming cause coral bleaching, a phenomenon that devastates reefs worldwide. Moreover, increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to ocean acidification, hampering the ability of corals to build their skeletons. Conservation efforts, therefore, are essential to preserve these biodiverse treasures for future generations. By supporting sustainable fishing practices, reducing carbon emissions, and implementing reef restoration programs, we can foster a healthier and resilient coral reef ecosystem.
D1-1686	"We study the properties of arbitrary micro-swimmers towing a passive load through a viscous liquid. The simple close-form expression for the dragging efficiency of a general micro-swimmer dragging a distant load is found, and the leading order approximation for finite mutual separation is derived. We show that, while swimmer can be arbitrarily efficient, dragging efficiency is always bounded from above. It is also demonstrated, that opposite to Purcell's assumption, the hydrodynamic coupling can ''help"" the swimmer to drag the load. We support our conclusions by rigorous numerical calculations for the ""necklace-shaped"" swimmer, towing a spherical cargo positioned at a finite distance."
D1-1687	 Photons, pulsating waves of light, travel at the speed of light with no mass, ruling the electromagnetic realm. On a larger scale, Earth's geological dance continues with the theory of plate tectonics, as the lithosphere fragments into vast, drifting plates floating atop the semi-fluid asthenosphere. However, these natural rhythms are now intertwined with human-induced oscillations. Climate variability, accelerated by human activities, has introduced an unprecedented rhythm in Earth's systems, with critical implications for coral reefs, biodiversity hotspots teetering at the brink. The question of how to mitigate this human-induced tempo and preserve these ecosystems remains a pressing concern in our quest for planetary harmony.
D1-1688	In this paper the Landscape potential is considered as an environment for system: trajectory-environment (TE). The trajectory is generating a measure on the landscape. The entropy of this dynamic measure is a power factor for trajectory. This dynamics leads to a memory appearance and produces a non-singular measure practically independently from initial conditions. It is shown that measure is dual to the metrics and its evolution may be considered as the landscape deformations: production-destruction of attractors-vacua. It seems like the renormalization process with phase transitions: renormgroup quantization. It is shown what the entropy of this global landscape measure acts on the trajectory alike a dark energy.
D1-1689	 In the vast cosmos, particles of light, or photons, travel at the speed of light, their constant motion a testament to their massless nature. Yet, in the subatomic realm, these same photons, when entangled, can exponentially influence each other despite vast distances, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. This interconnectivity, seemingly defying classical physics, hints at a deeper, intertwined universe. Meanwhile, the Higgs boson, a particle yet to be fully understood, is thought to bestow mass upon other particles, further unraveling the mysteries of existence. As we probe deeper into the microcosm, we expand our understanding of the cosmos, its origins, and the fundamental nature of reality.
D1-1690	Recent rsearches have shown that the lengths of the chemical bonds, whether completely or partially covalent or ionic, are sums of the radii of the adjacent atoms and/or ions. On investigating the bond length data for the molecular components of nucleic acids, all were found (for the first time) to be effectively the sums of the covalent radii of the adjacent atoms. This work shows that the bond lengths in caffeine and related molecules are likewise sums of the covalent radii of C, N, O and H. This has enabled arriving at the atomic structures of these molecules, also for the first time.
D1-1691	 In the intricate dance of life, the cellular machinery pulsates with dynamic energy. The kinetochore, a protein complex, orchestrates the tidal forces of chromosomes during cell division, driving the mitotic process. This dance of chromosomes, essential for cell growth and reproduction, is a microcosm of life's perpetual cycle.Remarkably, photons, the massless particles of light, are intimately connected to this cellular life, crucially implicated in the process of cell signaling. These electromagnetic messengers, invisible yet omnipresent, transmit essential instructions that govern cell behavior and interaction.Yet, our Earth, a colossal entity compared to the microscopic cells, also bears testament to these minuscule players. The geological wonders formed by the slow dance of tectonic plates, each piece teeming with life, reflect the intricate interplay of fundamental particles and grand natural forces.In the grand cosmic ballet, life, from the smallest cell to the vastness of the universe, dances to the rhythm of photons and other fundamental particles. The extraordinary complexity derived from such simplicity, the harmonious dance between the microscopic and the macroscopic, is a testament to the beauty of the natural world.
D1-1692	A damping strategy for blisks (integrally bladed disks) of turbomachinery involving a friction ring is investigated. These rings, located in grooves underside the wheel of the blisks, are held in contact by centrifugal loads and the energy is dissipated when relative motions between the ring and the disk occur. A representative lumped parameter model of the system is introduced and the steady-state nonlinear response is derived using a multi-harmonic balance method combined with an AFT procedure where the friction force is calculated in the time domain. Numerical simulations are presented for several damper characteristics and several excitation configurations. From these results, the performance of this damping strategy is discussed and some design guidelines are given.
D1-1693	 Molecules within living cells undergo complex biochemical pathways to perform vital functions. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency for all life, is synthesized via cellular respiration, a series of processes involving glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. During these pathways, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are broken down to release energy, yielding ATP. Simultaneously, oxidation reactions generate reactive oxygen species, which, if unregulated, can cause cellular damage. Antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase neutralize these harmful species, maintaining cellular health. This intricate network of biochemical pathways within cells is essential for life as we know it, underpinning growth, metabolism, and reproduction.
D1-1694	We present a new theory that the molecular high order harmonic generation in an intense laser field is determined by molecular internal symmetry and momentum distribution of the tunneling-ionized electron. The molecular internal symmetry determines the quantum interference form of the returning electron inside the molecule. The electron momentum distribution determines the relative interference strength of each individual electron de Broglie wave. All individual electron de Broglie wave interferences add together to collectively modulate the molecular high harmonic generation. We specifically discuss the suppression of the generation on adjacent harmonic orders and the dependence of molecular high harmonic generation on laser intensities and molecular axis alignment. Our theoretical results are in good consistency with the experimental observations.
D1-1695	 Celestial bodies, such as stars and planets, traverse the cosmos in an intricate dance dictated by celestial mechanics. Gravity, a fundamental force, is the maestro leading this symphony, pulling celestial bodies towards each other, and shaping the cosmic ballet. Orbits, ellipses, and revolutions form the choreography of this grand cosmic spectacle, with each body executing complex movements that can span millions of years. This celestial motion, though vastly different in scale from the cell cycle or the tectonic plates of Earth, is governed by the same elegant principles of physics, demonstrating the unity and harmony of the cosmos.
D1-1696	UV photoinduced fragmentation of protonated aromatics amino acids have emerged the last few years, coming from a situation where nothing was known to what we think a good understanding of the optical properties. We will mainly focus this review on the tryptophan case. Three groups have mostly done spectroscopic studies and one has mainly been involved in dynamics studies of the excited states in the femtosecond/picosecond range and also in the fragmentation kinetics from nanosecond to millisecond. All these data, along with high level ab initio calculations, have shed light on the role of the different electronic states of the protonated molecules upon the fragmentation mechanisms.
D1-1697	 The phenomenon of quantum entanglement, a peculiar bond between particles that maintains a connection, regardless of distance, is a captivating aspect of modern physics. These intertwined particles can instantaneously affect each other, seemingly defying the laws of space and time. However, this intriguing property is not without its challenges. For instance, any change to one entangled particle can unpredictably alter the state of the other, leading to unintended consequences in sensitive applications, such as quantum computing. Thus, understanding and harnessing this enigma requires a deep dive into the peculiarities of quantum mechanics and careful management of its potential side effects.
D1-1698	Many musical instruments, as for example woodwind instruments, flute or violins, are self-sustained oscillating systems, i.e. musician enacts as a continuous energy source to drive an oscillation in the passive resonator, the body of the instrument, by means of a nonlinear coupling. For single reed instruments like clarinet, there exists a minimal value of mouth pressure beyond which sound can appear. This paper deals with the analysis of this oscillation threshold, calculated using a modal decomposition of the resonator, in order to have a better comprehension of how reed characteristics, such as its strength and its damping, may influence the attack transient of notes.
D1-1699	 Evolutionary biology sheds light on the development of life forms through natural selection and adaptation. Darwin's theory proposes that species evolve over time from common ancestors as they adapt to their environments. This process results in diversity of life, with species becoming better suited to survive and reproduce.Modern synthesis further expanded on Darwin's ideas, integrating genetics into the theory. It explains how genetic variations arise and are passed down through generations, leading to changes in traits that can increase an organism's fitness.This theory has been supported by various lines of evidence, including the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and molecular genetics. The discovery of DNA and the establishment of the central dogma of molecular biology provided further insights into evolution, such as the role of mutations in producing genetic variation.Today, evolutionary biology continues to be a vital field of study, with applications in areas such as medicine, conservation, and forensics. Its principles help us understand the diversity of life on Earth and how organisms have adapted to their environments over time.
D1-1700	We explore stimulated photo-association in the context of attosecond pump-probe schemes of atomic matter. An attosecond pulse -- the probe -- is used to induce photo-association of an electronic wave packet which had been created before, typically with an attosecond pump pulse at an atomic center different from the one of photo-association. We will show that the electron absorption is maximal for a certain delay between the pulses. Two ways of enhancing and controlling stimulated photo-association are proposed, namely using an additional infrared pulse to steer the electronic wave packet and using a train of attosecond pulses instead of a single pair. A direct application of ultrafast stimulated photo-association is the measurement of atomic distances.
D1-1701	 In the realm of relativistic physics, a photon, the massless particle of light, defies all conventional notions of matter, exhibiting a intriguing duality as both a particle and a wave. Einstein's theory of relativity, revolving around the concepts of space and time, drastically alters our perception of these fundamental entities, proposing that they are not absolute but intertwined, known as spacetime. This theory also predicts time dilation, length contraction, and the speed limit of 299,792 kilometers per second for all objects, including photons, as they traverse this flexible fabric of the universe. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of this fabric, we unravel the cosmic dance of stars, galaxies, and even the expansion of the universe itself.
D1-1702	We report measurement of inelastic loss in dense and cold metastable ytterbium (Yb[$^3P_2$]). Use of an optical far-off-resonance trap enables us to trap atoms in all magnetic sublevels, removing multichannel collisional trap loss from the system. Trapped samples of Yb[$^3P_2$] are produced at a density of 2$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperature of 2 $\mu$K. We observe rapid two-body trap loss of Yb[$^3P_2$] and measure the inelastic collision rate constant 1.0(3)$\times10^{-11}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. The existence of the fine-structure changing collisions between atoms in the $^3P_2$ state is strongly suggested.
D1-1703	 Wine, a fermented beverage from grapes, carries intriguing physics and biology connections. Grapes, rich in sugars and yeast, undergo fermentation where yeast convert sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol, showcasing a biochemical reaction. The carbon dioxide adds tiny bubbles, making sparkling wines.The color of red wine comes from grape skin pigments, anthocyanins, which interact with ethanol and acids during processing. This interaction shifts anthocyanin's spectral properties, giving wine its vibrant hues.Red wine consumption has also been linked to health benefits due to polyphenols, such as resveratrol, found in grape skins. Polyphenols act as antioxidants, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and some cancers. However, moderation is key, as excessive drinking can lead to harmful health effects.So, a glass of wine, while social and enjoyable, offers an intriguing glimpse into the realms of physics, chemistry, and biology, while also potentially benefiting our health.
D1-1704	Slow-light enhanced absorption in liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals has recently been proposed as a route to compensate for the reduced optical path in typical lab-on-a-chip systems for bio-chemical sensing applications. A simple perturbative expression has been applied to ideal structures composed of lossless dielectrics. In this work we study the enhancement in structures composed of lossy dielectrics such as a polymer. For this particular sensing application we find that the material loss has an unexpected limited drawback and surprisingly, it may even add to increase the bandwidth for low-index contrast systems such as polymer devices.
D1-1705	 Molecules, the fundamental units of chemistry, play pivotal roles in shaping life's intricacies. Proteins, for instance, are complex chains of amino acids that perform various functions within cells, including enzymatic catalysis and structural support. DNA, the hereditary material, is a double helix of nucleotides encoding the instructions for all organisms. These biomolecules interact in complex ways to maintain life's delicate balance, driving growth, adaptation, and evolution.On the other hand, enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. They work by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, thus facilitating it more efficiently. Some enzymes are vital for sustaining life, like those involved in digestion, respiration, and DNA replication.In the realm of medicine, we find antibiotics, compounds produced by microorganisms that kill or inhibit the growth of other bacteria. These substances play a crucial role in preventing and treating bacterial infections. However, misuse can lead to antibiotic resistance, a growing global health concern.Understanding these biological compounds at the molecular level is essential for advancing our knowledge of life processes, developing new medicines, and combating emerging health threats like antibiotic resistance and pandemics.
D1-1706	We investigate the effect of nonlinearity in a system described by an adiabatically evolving Hamiltonian. Experiments are conducted in a three-core waveguide structure that is adiabatically varying with distance, in analogy to the STIRAP process in atomic physics. In the linear regime, the system exhibits an adiabatic power transfer between two waveguides which are not directly coupled, with negligible power recorded in the intermediate coupling waveguide. In the presence of nonlinearity the behavior of this configuration is drastically altered and the adiabatic light passage is found to critically depend on the excitation power. We show how this effect is related to the destruction of the dark state formed in the STIRAP configuration.
D1-1707	 In the cosmic dance of origins, light's fundamental particle, the photon, illuminated the vast darkness, setting the stage for the birth of celestial bodies. Among these, a unique terrestrial sphere formed, with a molten iron core, a silicate mantle, and a crystalline crust - the structure of a planet we call Earth.The Earth's crust is the theater for tectonic plates, seemingly moving entities that, in their convergence and divergence, have sculpted the continents and mountains over eons. A testament to the dynamic forces that shape our world.As time unfolded, these tectonic plates nurtured the creation of life, ushering in an astonishing era of biological evolution. Organisms adapted, thrived, and diversified, shaping the intricate web of life that blankets our planet today.Fast forward to the modern age, and the dance of the planets continues to fascinate us. The laws of motion, as postulated by the legendary Kepler, offer insights into their balletic orbits around the sun. The question of life beyond Earth, however, remains a captivating enigma, hinting at a cosmic symphony yet to be fully deciphered.Meanwhile, our planet, ever-changing and resilient, faces the challenges of the present, from the impacts of human activity to the emergence of global pandemics like COVID-19. As we continue to dance within these cosmic rhythms, the Earth's tapestry of life awaits our gentle touch, urging us to tread lightly and cherish its beauty as we celebrate the grand spectacle of its origins.
D1-1708	We explore the effect of discounting and experimentation in a simple model of interacting adaptive agents. Agents belong to either of two types and each has to decide whether to participate a game or not, the game being profitable when there is an excess of players of the other type. We find the emergence of large fluctuations as a result of the onset of a dynamical instability which may arise discontinuously (increasing the discount factor) or continuously (decreasing the experimentation rate). The phase diagram is characterized in detail and noise amplification close to a bifurcation point is identified as the physical mechanism behind the instability.
D1-1709	 Disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are complex phenomena that intertwine biology, society, and technology. They can be triggered by emergent pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, which are capable of transmitting efficiently among humans. The spread of these pathogens is influenced by numerous factors, including population density, travel patterns, and environmental conditions. The study of epidemiology and infectious diseases helps us understand and combat outbreaks, with strategies like vaccination, public health measures, and antiviral therapies being crucial in preventing and managing their impact. However, the ongoing emergence of new pathogens calls for constant vigilance and investment in research to stay ahead of this global health challenge.
D1-1710	In previous papers, we have presented hyperbolic governing equations and jump conditions for barotropic fluid mixtures. Now we extend our results to the most general case of two-fluid conservative mixtures taking into account the entropies of components. We obtain governing equations for each component of the medium. This is not a system of conservation laws. Nevertheless, using Hamilton's principle we are able to obtain a complete set of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. In particular, for the gas dynamics they coincide with classical jump conditions of conservation of momentum and energy. For the two-fluid case, the jump relations do not involve the conservation of the total momentum and the total energy.
D1-1711	 Photon particles, fundamental to light and electromagnetic radiation, have no mass and travel at the speed of light. They are the carriers of energy in electromagnetic waves, making them essential in various phenomena, from visible light to X-rays and radio waves. Photons play a crucial role in understanding and harnessing energy, such as solar power, and in the functioning of devices like lasers and semiconductors. However, their properties, such as simultaneously exhibiting both wave and particle behavior, remain fascinating mysteries of quantum mechanics. Engaging with these tiny, yet powerful, particles drives the advancements in technology and science, shaping our understanding of the universe.
D1-1712	Despite being the most popular methods of data analysis, Fourier-based techniques suffer from the problem of static resolution that is currently believed to be a fundamental limitation of the Fourier Transform. Although alternative solutions overcome this limitation, none provide the simplicity, versatility, and convenience of the Fourier analysis. The lack of convenience often prevents these alternatives from replacing classical spectral methods - even in applications that suffer from the limitation of static resolution.   This work demonstrates that, contrary to the generally accepted belief, the Fourier Transform can be generalized to the case of adaptive resolution. The generalized transform provides backward compatibility with classical spectral techniques and introduces minimal computational overhead.
D1-1713	 Thalidomide, initially designed as a sedative in the 1950s, was tragically associated with severe birth defects when administered to pregnant women. This devastating drug, though lightweight in substance, left an indelible mark in medical history due to its disastrous effects on unborn children, leading to the loss of limbs and other malformations. Today, its use is strictly regulated, serving as a stark reminder of the unforeseen consequences of human intervention in nature's intricate biological processes. Meanwhile, the pandemic we face today, COVID-19, originating from zoonotic transmission, highlights the delicate balance between human health, animal welfare, and the environment. This dual narrative underscores the need for caution and understanding in our interaction with both drugs and nature.
D1-1714	We investigate a network model based on an infinite regular square lattice embedded in the Euclidean plane where the node connection probability is given by the geometrical distance of nodes. We show that the degree distribution in the basic model is sharply peaked around its mean value. Since the model was originally developed to mimic the social network of acquaintances, to broaden the degree distribution we propose its generalization. We show that when heterogeneity is introduced to the model, it is possible to obtain fat tails of the degree distribution. Meanwhile, the small-world phenomenon present in the basic model is not affected. To support our claims, both analytical and numerical results are obtained.
D1-1715	 Biological evolution, a cornerstone of science, posits that species and populations of organisms undergo change over time. This shift, driven by natural selection, mutation, gene flow, and genetic drift, has resulted in the diverse biodiversity we see today. For instance, the various breeds of dogs can be traced back to the domestication of wolves thousands of years ago.This process, continuous and gradual, has shaped life forms across millions of years. From the simplest single-celled organisms to complex, multicellular entities, every species carries the imprint of its evolutionary history. This ongoing journey of adaptation and survival is echoed in the development of complex systems, such as the intricate web of coral reef ecosystems.Understanding evolutionary processes is crucial in addressing modern challenges, like the emergence of new diseases, such as COVID-19, and the impact of climate change on biodiversity. By studying the past, we can predict and prepare for the future, ensuring the survival and growth of life on our planet.
D1-1716	"We employ an evolutionary algorithm to investigate the optimal design of composite protectors using one-dimensional granular chains composed of beads of various sizes, masses, and stiffnesses. We define a fitness function using the maximum force transmitted from the protector to a ""wall"" that represents the body to be protected and accordingly optimize the {topology} (arrangement), {size}, and {material} of the chain. We obtain optimally randomized granular protectors characterized by high-energy equipartition and the transformation of incident waves into interacting solitary pulses. We consistently observe that the pulses traveling to the wall combine to form an extended (long-wavelength), small-amplitude pulse."
D1-1717	 General relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of gravity. It describes gravity not as a force but as a distortion of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This four-dimensional view of the universe, where space and time are woven together, reshaped our perception of the cosmos. It predicted phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves, concepts that have since been observed empirically, further validating this groundbreaking theory. Yet, despite its success, there are still unanswered questions regarding its behavior at small scales and its reconciliation with quantum mechanics, making it a subject of ongoing research in modern physics.
D1-1718	We investigated financial market data to determine which factors affect information flow between stocks. Two factors, the time dependency and the degree of efficiency, were considered in the analysis of Korean, the Japanese, the Taiwanese, the Canadian, and US market data. We found that the frequency of the significant information decreases as the time interval increases. However, no significant information flow was observed in the time series from which the temporal time correlation was removed. These results indicated that the information flow between stocks evidences time-dependency properties. Furthermore, we discovered that the difference in the degree of efficiency performs a crucial function in determining the direction of the significant information flow.
D1-1719	 Red wine, specifically, is often associated with the 'French Paradox,' a phenomenon where French people have a lower rate of heart disease despite a diet high in saturated fats. This can be partly attributed to the antioxidants present in red wine, primarily flavonoids and resveratrol. These compounds may help reduce LDL cholesterol and decrease blood clotting, thus offering potential heart health benefits. However, it's essential to note that moderation is key. excessive consumption can lead to alcohol-related health problems. As a fun fact, the dark red color of wine comes from the grape skin, rich in these heart-healthy antioxidants. Yet, more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential risks associated with regular red wine consumption.
D1-1720	We demonstrate a hard x-ray probe of laser-aligned small molecules. To align small molecules with optical lasers, high intensities at nonresonant wavelengths are necessary. We use 95 ps pulses focused to 40 mum from an 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser at a peak intensity of 10^12 W/cm^2 to create an ensemble of aligned bromotrifluoromethane (CF3Br) molecules. Linearly polarized, 120 ps x-ray pulses, focused to 10 mum, tuned to the Br 1s --> sigma* pre-edge resonance at 13.476 keV, probe the ensemble of laser-aligned molecules. The demonstrated methodology has a variety of applications and can enable ultrafast imaging of laser-controlled molecular motions with Angstrom-level resolution.
D1-1721	 Life's essential building blocks, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, form complex biomolecules intricately linked in a dance of chemistries. These compounds, born from simple molecules like carbon dioxide, water, and various minerals, unfold in intricate ways to create the intricate systems we know as life. This, the chemistry of life, is the realm of biochemistry, where the laws of chemistry and physics meet in a harmonious dance, orchestrating the life we know. From the intricate structure of DNA to the pulsating rhythm of ATP, the energy currency of life, every functionality revolves around these fundamental laws. Life's essence lies in this chemistry, a testament to the power and beauty of science.
D1-1722	We show that a simple and intuitive three-parameter equation fits remarkably well the evolution of the gross domestic product (GDP) in current and constant dollars of many countries during times of recession and recovery. We then argue that this equation is the response function of the economy to isolated shocks, hence that it can be used to detect large and small shocks, including those which do not lead to a recession. we also discuss its predictive power. Finally, a two-sector toy model of recession and recovery illustrates how the severity and length of recession depends on the dynamics of transfer rate between the growing and failing parts of the economy.
D1-1723	 Coral reefs, vibrant underwater metropolises teeming with diverse marine life, are Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems. These colorful cities are formed over centuries by tiny polyps that secrete calcium carbonate, creating intricate structures. However, these reefs face myriad threats, including climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, turning them ghostly white and vulnerable to death. Rapid climatic oscillations exacerbate this problem, as they disrupt the delicate balance necessary for reef sustainability. To protect coral reefs, efforts must focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and implementing effective conservation strategies to ensure the survival of these vital ecosystems.
D1-1724	The equilibrium statistical properties of DNA denaturation bubbles are examined in detail within the framework of the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. Bubble formation in homogeneous DNA is found to depend crucially on the presence of nonlinear base-stacking interactions. Small bubbles extending over less than 10 base pairs are associated with much larger free energies of formation per site than larger bubbles. As the critical temperature is approached, the free energy associated with further bubble growth becomes vanishingly small. An analysis of average displacement profiles of bubbles of varying sizes at different temperatures reveals almost identical scaled shapes in the absence of nonlinear stacking. nonlinear stacking leads to distinct scaled shapes of large and small bubbles.
D1-1725	 In the vast expanse of our universe, the Earth, encased within the enigma of plate tectonics, is a dynamic orb, its lithosphere divided into drifting plates that float on the semi-fluid astral sea. These titanic shifts sculpt our planet's landscapes, creating valleys and mountains, and influencing climate zones. Yet, these same environmental alterations, known as climatic oscillations, occurring on sub-centurial scales, are a source of continuous change, inspiring the evolution of life forms over millennia.Coral reefs, teeming with diversity, thrive in these temperate waters, serving as vital nurseries for marine life. However, these fragile ecosystems face the brunt of global warming and coral bleaching, mounting symptoms of a planet in transition. The origins of these climate shifts, much like the birth of life on Earth, remain shrouded in mystery, a puzzle that science continually strives to unravel. The interconnected web of climate, life, and geophysics forms the complex and ever-evolving narrative of our planet's history.
D1-1726	For partial wetting, motion of the triple liquid-gas-solid contact line is influenced by heterogeneities of the solid surface. This influence can be strong in the case of inertial (e.g. oscillation) flows where the line can be pinned or move intermittently. A model that takes into account both surface defects and fluid inertia is proposed. The viscous dissipation in the bulk of the fluid is assumed to be negligible as compared to the dissipation in the vicinity of the contact line. The equations of motion and the boundary condition at the contact line are derived from Hamilton's principle. The rapid capillary rise along a vertical inhomogeneous wall is treated as an example.
D1-1727	 Quantum physics delves into the microscopic realm, revealing the intricate dance of particles that form the fabric of our universe. Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon occurring when pairs or groups of particles interact in ways that defy traditional physics, has baffled scientists for decades. This mysterious connection allows two particles to instantaneously affect each other's state, no matter the distance between them.Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, proposed in 1935, demonstrates the perplexing nature of the quantum world. In this hypothetical scenario, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive atom are placed in a sealed box. Until the box is opened, both the cat's life and death exist in a superposition. Only upon observation does the cat's state become definite—either alive or dead.This enigmatic behavior continues to challenge our understanding of reality, challenging classical notions of causality and certainty. Still, as scientists probe further into the quantum realm, they uncover its potential for innovative technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, which may revolutionize modern information processing and communication.
D1-1728	Many networks extent in space, may it be metric (e.g. geographic) or non-metric (ordinal). Spatial network growth, which depends on the distance between nodes, can generate a wide range of topologies from small-world to linear scale-free networks. However, networks often lacked multiple clusters or communities. Multiple clusters can be generated, however, if there are time windows during development. Time windows ensure that regions of the network develop connections at different points in time. This novel approach could generate small-world but not scale-free networks. The resulting topology depended critically on the overlap of time windows as well as on the position of pioneer nodes.
D1-1729	 Photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose, is a vital process essential for life on Earth. This biochemical reaction happens in cellular organelles known as chloroplasts. Carbon dioxide and water are the primary raw materials, with light being the catalyst. Oxygen is also a byproduct, contributing to our atmosphere. This intricate dance of light, water, and carbon dioxide sustains the web of life, forming the basis of the food chain. However, climate change and other environmental factors threaten this delicate balance, raising concern about the future of photosynthesis and life as we know it.
D1-1730	In self-gravitating stars, two dimensional or geophysical flows and in plasmas, long range interactions imply a lack of additivity for the energy. as a consequence, the usual thermodynamic limit is not appropriate. However, by contrast with many claims, the equilibrium statistical mechanics of such systems is a well understood subject. In this proceeding, we explain briefly the classical approach to equilibrium and non equilibrium statistical mechanics for these systems, starting from first principles. We emphasize recent and new results, mainly a classification of equilibrium phase transitions, new unobserved equilibrium phase transition, and out of equilibrium phase transitions. We briefly discuss what we consider as challenges in this field.
D1-1731	 Atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it. The number of protons in an element defines its atomic number, while the total number of protons and neutrons determines the atom's mass number. Atoms can combine or separate to form various substances, a fundamental principle underlying chemistry. Atoms also play a crucial role in nuclear reactions, providing the energy source for the sun and nuclear power plants. The atomic structure, therefore, lies at the heart of our understanding of the universe and the chemistry that shapes our world.
D1-1732	The paper presents a new stiffness modelling method for overconstrained parallel manipulators, which is applied to 3-d.o.f. translational mechanisms. It is based on a multidimensional lumped-parameter model that replaces the link flexibility by localized 6-d.o.f. virtual springs. In contrast to other works, the method includes a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations, which allows computing the stiffness matrix for the overconstrained architectures and for the singular manipulator postures. The advantages of the developed technique are confirmed by application examples, which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two translational parallel manipulators.
D1-1733	 The process of natural selection, first proposed by Charles Darwin, is a key mechanism driving evolution and adaptation within species. This mechanism favoring certain traits over others is vital in the survival and propagation of life forms. In the realm of biology, natural selection operates by selectively passing advantageous traits to offspring, leading to changes in populations over time.Analogous to this, the concept of evolution by natural selection can be found in the realm of physics, where the constant interaction of particles governs the behavior and development of matter. For instance, atoms collide and merge, leading to the formation of various elements over time. This process can be likened to the survival of the fittest in the biological world.Moreover, natural selection plays a significant role in the process of ecological succession, where communities of organisms gradually replace each other as environmental conditions change over time. Similarly, in the cosmos, celestial bodies undergo dramatic changes and transformations due to various forces, such as gravitational interaction and stellar evolution, mirroring the adaptive process found in biological entities.In essence, the universal principle of natural selection shapes the development and transformation of both biological and physical systems, providing a fundamental lens through which we can better understand the world around us.
D1-1734	Isotope effects in reactions between Mg+ in the 3p 2P3/2 excited state and molecular hydrogen at thermal energies are studied through single reaction events. From only ~250 reactions with HD, the branching ratio between formation of MgD+ and MgH+ is found to be larger than 5. From additional 65 reactions with H2 and D2 we find that the overall decay probability of the intermediate MgH2+, MgHD+ or MgD2+ complexes is the same. Our study shows that few single ion reactions can provide quantitative information on ion-neutral reactions. Hence, the method is well-suited for reaction studies involving rare species, e.g., rare isotopes or short-lived unstable elements.
D1-1735	 The Earth's lithosphere, its outermost solid layer, is a dynamic structure, comprising several moving tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These plates, constantly in motion, shape the Earth's surface, forming mountains, valleys, and ocean floors through processes like plate convergence, divergence, and transformations. Volcanic activities, earthquakes, and mountain building are some of the visible effects of these plate movements. The theory of plate tectonics not only helps us understand the Earth's geological evolution but also aids in predicting seismic and volcanic activities. This intricate dance of plates plays a crucial role in shaping our planet's landscapes and climate, making it an exciting field of study in the realm of physics and Earth sciences.
D1-1736	Following the recent surge of interest in n-doped strontium titanate as a possible blue light emitter, a time-resolved photoluminescence analysis was performed on nominally pure, Nb-doped and oxygen-deficient single-crystal SrTiO3 samples. The doping-effects on both the electronic states involved in the transition and the decay mechanism are respectively analyzed by comparing the spectral and dynamic features and the yields of the emission. Our time-resolved analysis, besides shedding some light on the basic recombination mechanisms acting in these materials, sets the intrinsic bandwidth limit of the proposed blue light emitting optoelectronic devices made of Ti-based perovskites heterostructures in the GHz range.
D1-1737	 Electromagnetic waves, like photons, traverse the universe, carrying energy across vast distances. These waves, spanning frequencies from radio waves to gamma rays, impact various aspects of our world. For instance, radio waves power our wireless communications, while visible light illuminates our surroundings. Infrared waves warm objects, while ultraviolet rays can cause skin damage. X-rays and gamma rays are utilized in medical imaging and treatment, while cosmic rays, the highest-energy electromagnetic radiation, offer insights into the universe's most distant phenomena. Understanding electromagnetic radiation plays a crucial role in advancing technologies and unlocking secrets hidden within the cosmos.
D1-1738	Current concerns over reforming engineering education have focused attention on helping students develop skills and an adaptive expertise. Phenomenological guidelines for instruction along these lines can be understood as arising out of an emerging theory of thinking and learning built on results in the neural, cognitive, and behavioral sciences. We outline this framework and consider some of its implications for one example: developing a more detailed understanding of the specific skill of using mathematics in modeling physical situations. This approach provides theoretical underpinnings for some best-practice instructional methods designed to help students develop this skill and providesguidance for further research in the area.
D1-1739	 The reaction rates in chemical processes are pivotal to understanding the pace at which substances transform. These rates can be influenced by temperature, pressure, and concentrations, as described by the Arrhenius equation. Faster reaction rates lead to quicker product formation, such as the accelerated decay of radioactive isotopes, while slower rates cause reactions to proceed at a snail's pace, as seen in the gradual erosion of mountain ranges over thousands of years.On a cosmic scale, these reaction rates dictate the formation and evolution of celestial bodies. For instance, the Big Bang initiated the rapid expansion of the universe, while the formation of stars and planets progressed over millions to billions of years due to slower chemical reactions within cosmic clouds.However, in our day-to-day lives, these reaction rates impact us in more subtle ways. For example, the rate at which a slice of bread browns during toasting is directly linked to the chemical reactions involving sugars and amino acids. A faster reaction yields a toastier, crispier piece of bread, while a slower reaction produces a softer, less browned result.Understanding reaction rates provides us with a valuable tool to control and predict various chemical processes, from cooking to industry and beyond.
D1-1740	The purpose of this communication is to discuss the simulation of a free surface compressible flow between two fluids, typically air and water. We use a two fluid model with the same velocity, pressure and temperature for both phases. In such a numerical model, the free surface becomes a thin three dimensional zone. The present method has at least three advantages: (i) the free-surface treatment is completely implicit. (ii) it can naturally handle wave breaking and other topological changes in the flow. (iii) one can easily vary the Equation of States (EOS) of each fluid (in principle, one can even consider tabulated EOS). Moreover, our model is unconditionally hyperbolic for reasonable EOS.
D1-1741	 In the realm of physics, cholesterol's role in the human body is intriguingly mirrored by the behavior of gold in astrophysics. Just as cholesterol molecules form complex structures in cell membranes, regulating permeability and functionality, gold nanoparticles in space exhibit unique electromagnetic properties, influencing the behavior of light and other electromagnetic radiation.The debate over cholesterol levels and their impact on heart health parallels the ongoing argument about the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. Both issues are marked by a need for continuous monitoring, with new research providing valuable insights that help refine our understanding and inform decisions.However, unlike Earth's plates, the ideal cholesterol levels for an individual are not static but dynamic, influenced by factors such as age, genetics, diet, and lifestyle. As with the theory of plate tectonics that keeps evolving to accommodate new data, our understanding of cholesterol and its effects on health continues to grow and adapt.Reminiscent of the mysteries surrounding the origin of life on Earth, the question of cholesterol's optimal intake and its impact on cardiovascular health remains one of the great challenges in the field of human health and nutrition. Yet, much like the ongoing search for the roots of life on our planet, persistence and collaboration will undoubtedly lead to breakthroughs, paving the way for a healthier future.
D1-1742	A model is proposed to explain the observed correlation between monthly fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures. The model relies on the oceans being in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with the atmosphere. When temperature changes, the system attempts to restore the equilibrium, with a time constant constrained by the dynamic fluxes between the two. The model is used to reconstruct both the historic evolution of CO2 concentrations since 1885, as well as the monthly fluctuations since 1959. The best fit is obtained with the southern hemisphere sea surface temperature data. In this new picture, human emissions play no role in the build-up of atmospheric CO2, but do contribute to the fluxes that restore the equilibrium.
D1-1743	 Artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and sucralose, have gained popularity as zero-calorie alternatives to sugar, making them a ubiquitous presence in modern diets. Originally created from organic compounds, these sweeteners mimic the taste of sugar while offering a lower caloric impact. However, the long-term effects of artificial sweeteners on human health are still a subject of debate among scientists. While they are generally considered safe for consumption, there is ongoing research into potential links between these sweeteners and health issues such as diabetes, obesity, and various gut-related disorders. As the use of artificial sweeteners continues to rise, understanding their impact on our health becomes increasingly critical.
D1-1744	While nonlinear optical spectroscopy is becoming more commonly used to study the excited states of nonlinear-optical systems, a general theory of inhomogeneous broadening is rarely applied in lieu of either a simple Lorentzian or Gaussian model. In this work, we generalize all the important linear and second-order nonlinear susceptibility expressions obtained with sum-over state quantum calculations to include Gaussian and stretched Gaussian distributions of Lorentzians. We show that using the correct model to analyze experiments that probe a limited wavelength range can be critical and that this theory is better able to fit the subtle spectral features - such as the shoulder region of a resonance - when both models produce qualitatively similar responses.
D1-1745	 Photons, the massless particles of light, illuminate our world, a testament to the intricacies of quantum physics. Meanwhile, the Earth's surface unveils a constant dance as tectonic plates, like curious children, shift, crumble, and collide, sculpting our world's topography.Yet, life, a mystery in itself, is the most captivating manifestation. Abiogenesis, the theory postulating the origin of life from non-living matter, remains a fascinating enigma. While sciency minds theorize on the perfect brew of chemicals giving rise to the first microorganisms, life as we know it unfolded, evolving through the intricate dance of natural selection.However, life's path is not without pitfalls. The pandemic, for example, is a stark reminder of the delicate balance that sustains life on our planet, a balance that can be disrupted by the slightest inclination.On the other hand, the debate on daily egg consumption or the effects of alcohol paint a complex picture of how human knowledge evolves as we strive to balance our health, our tastes, and our understanding of the world. Ultimately, science continues to shed light on our path, leading us to countless questions, and, in turn, more enlightenment.
D1-1746	We solve the (2+1)D nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH) for input beams that collapse in the simpler NLS model. Thereby, we provide the first ever numerical evidence that nonparaxiality and backscattering can arrest the collapse. We also solve the (1+1)D NLH and show that solitons with radius of only half the wavelength can propagate over forty diffraction lengths with no distortions. In both cases we calculate the backscattered field, which has not been done previously. Finally, we compute the dynamics of counter-propagating solitons using the NLH model, which is more comprehensive than the previously used coupled NLS model.
D1-1747	 The COVID-19 pandemic, a global crisis unprecedented in recent decades, originated from a zoonotic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This virus, originating from bats, is believed to have been transmitted to humans via an intermediary host, likely pangolins. The pandemic underscores the delicate balance between human health, animal health, and the environment. As human activities encroach on natural habitats, the likelihood of zoonotic spillover events, such as this one, increases. Understanding and mitigating these risks is crucial in preventing future pandemics. The pandemic has also accelerated research and development in the field of vaccines and therapeutics, demonstrating the rapid advancement of science in times of crisis.
D1-1748	"We propose a new method to obtain approximate solutions for the Schr\""{o}dinger equation with an arbitrary potential that possesses bound states. This method, relying on the auxiliary field technique, allows in many cases to find analytical solutions. It offers a convenient way to study the qualitative features of the energy spectrum of bound states in any potential. In particular, we illustrate our method by solving the case of central potentials with power-law form and with logarithmic form. For these types of potentials, we propose very accurate analytical energy formulae which improve a lot the corresponding formulae that can be found in literature."
D1-1749	 In the realm of physics, the concept of thermodynamics offers insights into the behavior of energy in a system. A key principle is the first law, also known as the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. This law governs the efficiency of engines and the transfer of heat in various systems.Within our world, the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy, stands as a fundamental point. Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness, tends to increase over time within a closed system, leading to a natural decay of organized structures. This law has profound implications in our understanding of the universe's expansion and the irreversibility of processes like the melting of ice or the aging of organisms.The third law of thermodynamics provides a boundary to the second law by stating that as a system approaches absolute zero, its entropy approaches a constant value. This establishes a universal minimum level of disorder, further emphasizing the interconnectedness and inherent order found in the universe.
D1-1750	We study the dynamics of epidemic and reaction-diffusion processes in metapopulation models with heterogeneous connectivity pattern. In SIR-like processes, along with the standard local epidemic threshold, the system exhibits a global invasion threshold. We provide an explicit expression of the threshold that sets a critical value of the diffusion/mobility rate below which the epidemic is not able to spread to a macroscopic fraction of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is found to be affected by the topological fluctuations of the metapopulation network. The presented results provide a general framework for the understanding of the effect of travel restrictions in epidemic containment.
D1-1751	 Protein synthesis is a fundamental process in cells, where a sequence of amino acids links together to form a protein based on instructions from DNA. This intricate dance of macromolecules, catalyzed by the ribosome and transfer RNA, is the foundation of life, dictating the structure and function of all proteins within an organism. In simple terms, protein synthesis is like a cell's unique orchestra, crafting the interactive proteins that enable cellular growth, maintenance, and reproduction, each playing their part in the human body's symphony of life.
D1-1752	In this paper we investigate x-ray and $\gamma$-ray propagation in crystals having a constant strain gradient and flat or cylindrical surfaces. When a displacement field is present, we solve the Takagi-Taupin equations either by the Riemann-Green method or by a numerical method. We apply the results to study the operation of a double-crystal Laue-Laue diffractometer having a flat collimating crystal followed by a bent analyzer crystal. In particular, we examine the effect of the analyzer strain on the location of the diffraction peaks in the dispersive and non-dispersive setup, thus confirming our previously reported peak-location as being set only by the diffracting plane spacing on the analyzer entrance surface.
D1-1753	 Carbohydrates, fundamental organic molecules that provide essential energy, undergo glycolysis and cellular respiration for their breakdown. Glycolysis, a process occurring in the cytoplasm, breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules, yielding ATP and NADH. In cellular respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion, followed by the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, generating more ATP and water, while releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product. This intricate biochemical dance powers most living organisms, from the smallest microbe to the largest mammals, making it a fundamental aspect of life on Earth.
D1-1754	Energy dissipation rate is an important parameter for nearly every experiment on turbulent flow. Mathematically precise relationships between energy dissipation rate and other measurable statistics for the case of anisotropic turbulence are useful to experimentalists. Such relationships are obtained for which the measurable statistics are the 3rd-order and 2nd-order velocity structure functions as well as the acceleration-velocity structure function. The relationships are derived using the Navier-Stokes equation without approximation. Approximate versions are obtained on the basis of local stationarity and local homogeneity. The latter are valid for arbitrary Reynolds numbers for the case of stationary, homogeneous turbulence. Precise use of the mathematics requires care noted in the Discussion section.
D1-1755	 In the realm of virology, a single virus particle, or virion, is the agent of infectious disease. Virions are not alive, yet can replicate by hijacking host cells. The coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, have enveloped spike proteins that facilitate attachment to human cells, initiating infection.Viral evolution occurs when genetic mutations, recombinations, or horizontal gene transfers result in altered virus behavior. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe has been partly attributed to its high mutation rate and ability to evade host immune responses.These adaptions and modifications contribute to the ongoing issues in controlling viral epidemics, making it essential to monitor viral evolution and develop preventive measures accordingly. Understanding the complexities of viral behavior and evolution will be crucial in combating current and future pandemics.
D1-1756	Fifty years ago, John von Neumann compared the architecture of the brain with that of computers that he invented and which is still in use today. In those days, the organisation of computers was based on concepts of brain organisation. Here, we give an update on current results on the global organisation of neural systems. For neural systems, we outline how the spatial and topological architecture of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of self-organization for such architectures. After all, the organization of the brain might again inspire computer architecture.
D1-1757	 In the realm of physics, Einstein's theory of general relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity. This theory posits that massive objects, such as planets and stars, can warp the fabric of space-time around them, causing nearby objects to move along curved paths. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, allows us to observe distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden from view.Moreover, general relativity predicts that time may run slower near a massive object. This effect, known as time dilation, has been confirmed in experiments involving atomic clocks. This means that a clock on Earth would tick slower compared to an identical clock in space, far from any large mass.As we continue to explore the universe and refine our understanding of gravity, the mysteries of space-time keep scientists intrigued, pushing the boundaries of what we know about our cosmos.
D1-1758	A technique is proposed to generate attosecond pulse trains of radiation from a Free-Electron Laser amplifier. The optics-free technique synthesises a comb of longitudinal modes by applying a series of spatio-temporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and electron bunch in the FEL. The modes may be phase-locked by modulating the electron beam energy at the mode spacing frequency. Three-dimensional simulations demonstrate the generation of a train of 400as pulses at giga-watt power levels evenly spaced by 2.5fs at a wavelength of 124 Angstrom. In the X-ray at wavelength 1.5 Angstrom, trains of 23as pulses evenly spaced by 150as and of peak power up to 6GW are predicted.
D1-1759	 Marine bioluminescence, a captivating phenomenon, illuminates the depths of countless oceans. Bioluminescent organisms, such as jellyfish and deep-sea fish, generate their light through a chemical reaction called chemiluminescence. This process involves the oxidation of a chemical called luciferin, in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, producing a burst of blue-green or yellowish light. This fascinating spectacle serves multiple purposes, such as attracting prey, signaling, camouflaging, and deterring predators. The study of marine bioluminescence continues to unveil the wonders of the ocean, challenging our understanding of life's adaptations and evolutions in these unique environments.
D1-1760	In this work, Pseudo-Random Bit Generation (PRBG) based on 2D chaotic mappings of logistic type is considered. The sequences generated with two Pseudorandom Bit Generators (PRBGs) of this type are statistically tested and the computational effectiveness of the generators is estimated. The role played by the symmetry and the geometrical properties of the underlying chaotic attractors is also explored. Considering these PRBGs valid for cryptography, the size of the available key spaces are calculated. Additionally, a novel mechanism called 'symmetry-swap' is introduced in order to enhance the PRBG algorithm. It is shown that it can increase the degrees of freedom of the key space, while maintaining the speed and performance in the PRBG.
D1-1761	 In the realm of modern medicine, drug development is a meticulous process that involves the design, testing, and production of pharmaceuticals to combat various diseases. A notable example is mRNA technology, which has revolutionized vaccine production, such as in the case of COVID-19 vaccines. This technology works by delivering a piece of the virus's genetic code to cells, instructing them to produce the antigen, stimulating an immune response without causing the actual disease.While drug development is indispensable for improving human health, it is not without its challenges. The process can be lengthy, expensive, and fraught with uncertainties due to the complexity of the human body and the diverse responses to treatment. However, advancements in technology, such as AI and machine learning, are being employed to streamline and expedite the process, potentially saving lives and alleviating suffering more efficiently.Just as the photon, a fundamental particle of light, traverses the universe without impediment, the pursuit of better medications continues, propelled by the indomitable spirit of human ingenuity and compassion.
D1-1762	The paper is devoted to elaboration of a novel specific indicator based on the modified Holder exponents. This indicator has been used for forecasting critical points of financial time series and crashes of the USA stock market. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis, which claims that before market critical points occur the dynamics of financial time series radically changes, namely time series become smoother. The approach has been tested on the stylized data and real USA stock market data. It has been shown that it is possible to forecast such critical points of financial time series as large upward and downward movements and trend changes. On this basis a new trading strategy has been elaborated and tested.
D1-1763	 The process of species adaptation is a dynamic response to changes in their environment, a natural phenomenon that has shaped life on Earth. For instance, the peppered moth (Biston betularia) in Britain adapted during the industrial revolution. As the industrialization darkened trees, a darker form of the moth emerged, blending in and surviving predator detection more effectively. This is an example of phenotypic plasticity and microevolution.In the face of global climate change, species are now adapting at an unprecedented scale. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are shifting their feeding habits to include more fish, as sea ice continues to melt and seals become scarce. Similarly, some birds are altering their migratory patterns to avoid extreme temperatures and altered food availability.Evolution is not just a story of the past. it is an ongoing process that determines the resilience and survival of species in a rapidly changing world. The ability of organisms to evolve and adapt will be crucial in ensuring biodiversity preservation in the face of human-induced environmental alterations.
D1-1764	The base is the Lagrangian of symmetry and its dynamical breaking or Higgs breaking. When the soliton-like solutions of the scalar field equations are substituted into the spinor field equations, in the approximation of non-relativity we derive the Morse-type potential, whose energy spectrum is the GMO mass formula and its modified accurate mass formula. According to the symmetry of s-c quarks, the heavy flavor hadrons which made of u,d and c quarks may be classified by SU(3) octet and decuplet. Then some simple mass formulas are obtained, from this we predict some masses of unknown hadrons.
D1-1765	 In the realm of physics, the concept of space-time curvature sheds light on the intricate dance of matter and energy. This theory, popularized by Albert Einstein, proposes that massive objects, like stars or planets, warp the fabric of space-time around them. This curvature, in turn, influences the path of other objects moving within it, effectively shaping the cosmos we inhabit. The concept of space-time further suggests that gravity arises from this curvature, not from a pulling force as previously thought. It's a captivating interplay of mass, space, and time that continues to unfold as we delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe.
D1-1766	Angular momentum densities of electromagnetic beams are connected to helicity (circular polarization) and topological charge (azimuthal phase shift and vorticity). Computing the electromagnetic fields emitted by a circular antenna array, analytic expressions are found for the densities of energy, linear and angular momentum in terms of helicity and vorticity. It is found that the angular momentum density can be separated into spin and orbital parts, a result that is known to be true in a beam geometry. The results are of importance for information-rich radio astronomy and space physics as well as novel radio, radar, and wireless communication concepts.
D1-1767	 Alcohol, primarily ethanol, is a psychoactive substance derived from fermented fruits, grains, or sugars. It alters brain function, temporarily impairing judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Long-term consumption can lead to a range of health issues, including liver disease, heart problems, and increased risk of certain cancers. Alcohol is also implicated in causing accidents and violent behavior. Moderation is key, as the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that no level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. On the brighter side, alcohol has historical and cultural significance, contributing to social gatherings, traditions, and even medicine in some societies. It's a fascinating study, where science and culture intersect, with its impacts on human health, behavior, and society being a continuous area of exploration.
D1-1768	We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .
D1-1769	 Phosphorescent algae illuminate the ocean's depths, their bioluminescence a spectacle of nature. This phenomenon is a result of energy stored within their molecules, a manifestation of quantum physics at work. As sea levels rise, these algae could potentially relocate coral reefs, a crucial biodiverse ecosystem, to less hospitable environments. Carbon emissions from human activities contribute to this rise, disrupting delicate marine ecosystems. The rapid change in oceanic conditions could lead to the extinction of various marine species, threatening the global food chain. Thus, understanding and mitigating our impact on the ocean becomes pivotal in preserving its rich ecosystems and the services they provide.
D1-1770	We propose a promising scheme to decelerate a cw filtering out molecular beam using a red-detuned quasi-cw semi-Gaussian laser beam. By using Monte-Carlo simulation method, we demonstrate this optical Stark deceleration scheme, and study its decelerated dynamic process for a cw ND3 molecular beam as well as the dependence of the deceleration effect on the border width of the semi-Gaussian beam. Our study shows that the proposed scheme can be used to efficiently slow a cw ND3 molecular beam, and obtain a relative average kinetic-energy loss of 9.33% by using a single semi-Gaussian beam with a well depth of 7.3 mK.
D1-1771	 Quantum oscillations in condensed matter physics reveal intriguing behaviors at low temperatures. These oscillations, appearing in materials like metals and semiconductors, stem from the quantum mechanical nature of electrons and their cyclic motion in a magnetic field. They offer insights into the electronic properties of materials and can potentially lead to advancements in technology, such as superconductivity and spintronics.However, even these oscillations aren't fixed in time. Natural oscillation patterns vary over various timescales, with some lasting hundreds of years. The study of these long-term patterns in both quantum systems and geophysical phenomena, like climate and plate tectonics, can help us predict future events and deepen our understanding of the universe's intricate rhythms. This interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic scales showcases the interconnectedness and harmony within nature.
D1-1772	We propose a model of random diffusion to investigate flow fluctuations in complex networks. We derive an analytical law showing that the dependence of fluctuations with the mean traffic in a network is ruled by the delicate interplay of three factors, respectively of dynamical, topological and statistical nature. In particular, we demonstrate that the existence of a power-law scaling characterizing the flow fluctuations at every node in the network can not be claimed for. We show the validity of this scaling breakdown under quite general topological and dynamical situations by means of different traffic algorithms and by analyzing real data.
D1-1773	 Quantum entanglement, a peculiar phenomenon, links particles not just in space but also in time, a concept beyond conventional understanding. Entangled particles, once interacted, remain connected irrespective of distance, exhibiting instantaneous correlations upon measurement. This intricate connection defies the classical notion of causality, challenging the very foundations of Einstein's relativistic space-time. The mysteries of quantum entanglement, thus, continue to fascinate physicists, offering glimpses into a world where particles seemingly dance to a rhythm beyond the observable universe.
D1-1774	We report the observation of imaging beyond the diffraction limit due to bound surface states in negative refraction photonic crystals. We achieve an effective negative index figure-of-merit [-Re(n)/Im(n)] of at least 380, ~125x improvement over recent efforts in the near-infrared, with a 0.4 THz bandwidth. Supported by numerical and theoretical analyses, the observed near-field resolution is 0.47 lambda, clearly smaller than the diffraction limit of 0.61 lambda. Importantly, we show this sub-diffraction imaging is due to the resonant excitation of surface slab modes, allowing refocusing of non-propagating evanescent waves.
D1-1775	 In the realm of microscopic life, cell division is the engine propelling growth and reproduction. This process, akin to a mechanical duplicator, dissects a single cell into two, each containing a replica of the original's genetic blueprint. As cells duplicate, they form tissues and organs, building the complex structures we call life. Yet, its intricate dance is not without flaw. errors in cell division can lead to diseases like cancer, reminding us of the delicate balance that maintains our lives. As we explore the mysteries of life and its origin, understanding cell division stands as a key to deciphering the code of life itself.
D1-1776	This paper provides a concise summary of the current status of the research and future perspectives discussed in the Mini-Conference on Angular Momentum Transport in Laboratory and Nature. This Mini-conference, sponsored by the Topical Group on Plasma Astrophysics, was held as part of the American Physical Society's Division of Plasma Physics 2007 Annual Meeting (November 12--16, 2007). This Mini-conference covers a wide range of phenomena happening in fluids and plasmas, either in laboratory or in nature. The purpose of this paper is not to comprehensively review these phenomena, but to provide a starting point for interested readers to refer to related research in areas other than their own.
D1-1777	 Molecules, the microscopic building blocks of matter, engage in intricate dances of attraction and repulsion, forming the basis of chemical reactions. These interactions govern the behavior of substances at a molecular level, facilitating processes such as combustion, metabolism, and synthesis. In biology, molecular interactions within cells drive growth, reproduction, and the complex mechanisms of life. Interestingly, these interactions can also initiate disease—as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to human receptors, triggering an immune response that can lead to devastating effects. Understanding these molecular interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments and mitigating future pandemics.
D1-1778	When moving from one arbitrary location at another, a parallel manipulator may change its assembly-mode without crossing a singularity. Because the non-singular change of assembly-mode cannot be simply detected, the actual assembly-mode during motion is difficult to track. This paper proposes a global explanatory approach to help better understand non-singular assembly-mode changing motions for 3-RPR planar parallel manipulators. The approach consists in fixing one of the actuated joints and analyzing the configuration-space as a surface in a 3-dimensional space. Such a global description makes it possible to display all possible non-singular assembly-mode changing trajectories.
D1-1779	 Orbiting celestial bodies obey intricate laws of motion, as elucidated by Kepler's and Newton's principles. These laws govern the dance of planets, moons, and satellites around their parent stars, describing their paths, speeds, and the magical balance that keeps them from crashing. Astronomers utilize this understanding to predict the future positions of celestial objects, enabling space exploration and our expanding cosmic knowledge.Also, the intriguing realm of orbital mechanics extends beyond our solar system to the fascinating realms of binary stars, galaxy clusters, and the colossal cosmic dance of galaxies. Thus, orbital mechanics, a vital branch of physics, offers insights into the wonders of the cosmos and the mysterious forces that shape our universe.
D1-1780	The Universe, far to be homogenous, expands in large empty bubbles of the large-scale structure, but not in mass concentrations like galaxies, so that the Robertson-Walker solution does not fit. We suggest that a symmetry breaking occurred in a distant past, during the radiation-dominated era. Before, the three-dimensional hypersurface was invariant under the action of O(3) and the Robertson-Walker metric could be used. But this obliges the so-called constants and physics, length and time scale factors to be involved through a generalized gauge process, which is built. The subsequent variation of the speed of light solves the horizon problem, while the Planck barrier disappears
D1-1781	 Pharmaceutical advancements throughout history have significantly influenced medical practices. Antibiotics, for instance, revolutionized the treatment of infections in the early 20th century. Penicillin, discovered by Alexander Fleming, is a prime example. Meanwhile, the vaccine for smallpox, created by Edward Jenner in 1796, eradicated one of the most devastating diseases in human history.More recently, the human genome project, completed in 2003, has opened doors to personalized medicine. This era of precision medicine, custom-tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, promises to transform healthcare.However, not all pharmaceutical developments have been positive. Thalidomide, a sedative and anti-nauseant drug, tragically led to thousands of birth defects in children born to mothers who used the drug during pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s. This terrible event underscores the importance of rigorous testing and ethical guidelines in the pharmaceutical industry.The ongoing pandemic underscores the continued need for cutting-edge medical research and the development of effective treatments and vaccines. The rapid creation of vaccines for COVID-19, though a remarkable achievement, also serves as a reminder of the potential risks and rewards in the ever-evolving field of pharmaceuticals.
D1-1782	A new analysis and new Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the measurements of the mobility $\mu_{i}$ of O$_{2}^{-} $ ions in dense supercritical Ar gas are reported. $\mu_{i}$ shows a marked dependence on the distance from the critical temperature $T_{c}.$ A mobility defect appears as a function of the gas density and its maximum value occurs below the critical density. The locus of points of maximum mobility defect in the $P-T$ plane appears on the extrapolation of the coexistence curve into the single-phase region. MD simulations quantitatively reproduce the mobility defect near $T_{c}.$
D1-1783	" Genetic drift refers to the random changes in the frequencies of alleles (versions of a gene) in a population over generations. This process occurs when genetic variation is lost by chance, rather than natural selection. It can significantly impact the genetic diversity and eventually, the evolution of a species.For instance, in a small, isolated population, the death of an individual carrying a particular allele can lead to its disappearance from the population, despite its potential advantage in survival. Conversely, an allele present in few individuals may increase dramatically in frequency due to chance events. This disproportionate impact of rare and common alleles, known as the ""founder effect,"" is a form of genetic drift.The principle of genetic drift can be observed in various contexts, such as the evolution of a bacterial population resistant to antibiotics in a hospital setting. The random survival and reproduction of resistant bacteria can lead to a rapid increase in their frequency, challenging antibiotic treatment strategies. Understanding the role of genetic drift is crucial in managing conservation efforts, disease control, and genetic engineering projects."
D1-1784	Plagiarism is a crime against academy. It deceives readers, hurts plagiarized authors, and gets the plagiarist undeserved benefits. However, even though these arguments do show that copying other people's intellectual contribution is wrong, they do not apply to the copying of words. Copying a few sentences that contain no original idea (e.g. in the introduction) is of marginal importance compared to stealing the ideas of others. The two must be clearly distinguished, and the 'plagiarism' label should not be used for deeds which are very different in nature and importance.   Keywords: academic dishonesty. academic integrity. academic misconduct. cheating. copyright infringement. ethics. intellectual property. research misconduct
D1-1785	 Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime, were first predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1916. They were observed directly for the first time in 2015 by the LIGO and Virgo observatories, marking a monumental breakthrough in astronomy. These waves are produced by the acceleration of massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars when they collide. Their detection opens a new window into the universe, allowing us to study phenomena that were previously inaccessible, deepening our understanding of the cosmos and its complex history. Like the cell cycle, the Big Bang, and the movement of the celestial bodies, gravitational waves are a testament to the fascinating, interconnected stories and intricate mechanisms that underlie the universe we inhabit.
D1-1786	Dispersive Fourier transformation is a powerful technique in which spectral information is mapped into the time domain using chromatic dispersion. It replaces a spectrometer with an electronic digitizer, and enables real-time spectroscopy. The fundamental problem in this technique is the trade-off between the detection sensitivity and spectral resolution, a limitation set by the digitizer's bandwidth. This predicament is caused by the power loss associated with optical dispersion. We overcome this limitation using Raman amplified spectrum-to-time transformation. An extraordinary loss-less -11.76 ns/nm dispersive device is used to demonstrate single-shot gas absorption spectroscopy with 950 MHz resolution--a record in real-time spectroscopy.
D1-1787	" Heart disease, a major global health concern, is primarily triggered by factors like high cholesterol, hypertension, and obesity. Atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries, is a key culprit. This process begins when low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol, collect within the arterial walls, potentially leading to plaque formation.Regular physical exercise, a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy body weight can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. Notably, choosing foods low in saturated fats and trans fats, and rich in fiber, can help manage cholesterol levels.Medical advancements have led to various treatments for heart disease, including medications to lower cholesterol, control blood pressure, and inhibit blood clots. Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and managing stress, also play crucial roles in heart health management.Understanding heart disease and taking proactive steps toward heart health remains essential, given that heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide."
D1-1788	Grooves were etched in a conductive layer of a conductive, transparent glass, and a nanoporous TiO2 film was deposited on both the conductive and nonconductive area. The width of the grooves was 100 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m. A transparent TiO2 film was dye-sensitized, covered with an electrolyte, and sandwiched with a cover glass. The conductivity of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film permeated with electrolyte was studied in the dark and under illumination, and was observed to be dependent on light intensity, wavelength and applied voltage. This study shows that dye-sensitized nanoporous films can be used as a wavelength dependent photoconductor.
D1-1789	 Coral reefs, nature's vibrant underwater metropolis, teem with diverse marine life, making them among Earth's most biodiverse and vital ecosystems. Yet, they face dire threats due to global warming, ocean acidification, and pollution. The mass bleaching events, triggered by rising sea temperatures, are a significant concern.General relativity, a theory by Einstein, explains the large-scale structure of the universe, but its application to coral reefs can help us understand the forces driving their degradation, potentially leading to more effective conservation strategies.Artificial sweeteners, while appearing harmless, have an impact on marine life. They enter the ocean through wastewater and can alter the microbial communities in coral reefs, potentially affecting the reef's overall health and resilience.The question of how to preserve these precious underwater edifices is a pressing one. It involves addressing the root causes of their destruction and finding ways to mitigate human impacts. Just as the theory of general relativity rearranged our understanding of the universe, so too must our approach to coral reef conservation resemble a paradigm shift if we are to ensure their survival for future generations.
D1-1790	The wave function was proposed for description of quantum phenomena on the atomic level. But now it is well known that quantum phenomena are observed not only on atomic level and the wave function is used for description of macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. The essence of the wave function on level elementary particles was and is the subject of heated argument among founders of quantum mechanics and other physicists. This essence seems more clear in superconductor. But impossibility of probabilistic interpretation of wave function in this case results to obvious contradiction of quantum principles with some fundamental principles of physics.
D1-1791	 In the realm of climate science, the concept of the Milankovitch cycles offers a compelling explanation for significant climatic oscillations over thousands of years. These cycles, stemming from changes in Earth's orbit, axial tilt, and the tilt of its wobbling axis, are responsible for periodic shifts in solar radiation received by the planet, thereby influencing glaciation and climatic patterns.Currently, we are in a geological era known as the Holocene, characterized by comparatively stable and hospitable conditions. However, climate variability, driven by natural and human-induced factors, threatens these conditions. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects an increase in global temperature, sea level rise, and extreme weather events due to greenhouse gas emissions, also known as anthropogenic climate change.As we grapple with the implications of these shifts, it is crucial to adopt sustainable practices, invest in renewable energy, and promote global cooperation to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and ensure a stable and resilient planet for future generations.
D1-1792	We show the formation of bright and dark slow optical solitons based on intersubband transitions in a semiconductor quantum well (SQW). Using the coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell approach, we provide both analytical and numerical results. Such a nonlinear optical process may be used for the control technology of optical delay lines and optical buffers in the SQW solid-state system. With appropriate parameters, we also show the generation of a large cross-phase modulation (XPM). Since the the intersubband energy level can be easily tuned by an external bias voltage, the present investigation may open the possibility for electrically controlled phase modulator in the solid-state system.
D1-1793	 In the realm of particle physics, the Higgs boson, colloquially known as the 'God particle,' is a fundamental, elementary particle in the Standard Model of physics. It was hypothesized to give other particles their mass, and its discovery in 2012 confirmed the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. However, its interactions remain complex and not yet fully understood, sparking ongoing research and discussions within the scientific community.
D1-1794	A theory describing above-threshold ionization of atoms and ions in a strong electromagnetic field is presented. It is based on the widely known strong field approximation and incorporates the Coulomb interaction between the photoelectron and the nucleus using the method of complex classical trajectories. A central result of the theory is the Coulomb-corrected ionization amplitude whose evaluation requires little extra numerical effort. By comparing our predictions with the results of ab initio numerical solutions for two examples we show that the new theory provides a significant improvement of the Coulomb-free strong field approximation. For the case of above-threshold ionization in elliptically polarized fields a comparison with available experimental data is also presented.
D1-1795	 Mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. This process, called cellular respiration, involves a series of complex chemical reactions. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell, is produced during this process. Mitochondria are unique in that they have their own DNA, separate from the nucleus, suggesting an origin separate from the rest of the cell. This organelle's evolution and role in energy production have been crucial to the complexity and survival of eukaryotic cells. The intricate dance of cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, continues to astound scientists, offering insights into evolution, energy, and life itself.
D1-1796	In recent years, two important techniques for geometric numerical discretization have been developed. In computational electromagnetics, spatial discretization has been improved by the use of mixed finite elements and discrete differential forms. Simultaneously, the dynamical systems and mechanics communities have developed structure-preserving time integrators, notably variational integrators that are constructed from a Lagrangian action principle. Here, we discuss how to combine these two frameworks to develop variational spacetime integrators for Maxwell's equations. Extending our previous work, which first introduced this variational perspective for Maxwell's equations without sources, we also show here how to incorporate free sources of charge and current.
D1-1797	 Molecular biology delves into the intricate world of biochemical pathways that govern cellular functions. These pathways are intricate networks of biochemical reactions, regulated by enzymes, that facilitate growth, reproduction, and energy production within cells. For instance, the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a fundamental pathway involved in cellular respiration, generating energy in the form of ATP. Another critical pathway is the glycolysis process, which breaks down glucose to produce energy, even without oxygen. These pathways are interconnected, forming a complex web of biochemical interactions that sustain life within cells. However, disruptions in these pathways can lead to various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and metabolic disorders, highlighting their importance in maintaining cellular health. The ongoing exploration of these pathways continues to unravel the mysteries of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-1798	We extend the theory for laser cooling in a near-resonant optical lattice to include multiple excited hyperfine states. Simulations are performed treating the external degrees of freedom of the atom, i.e., position and momentum, classically, while the internal atomic states are treated quantum mechanically, allowing for arbitrary superpositions. Whereas theoretical treatments including only a single excited hyperfine state predict that the temperature should be a function of lattice depth only, except close to resonance, experiments have shown that the minimum temperature achieved depends also on the detuning from resonance of the lattice light. Our results resolve this discrepancy.
D1-1799	 Celestial bodies, such as planets and stars, follow intricate paths dictated by gravitational forces and the laws of motion. Kepler's laws, for instance, describe the elliptical orbits of these celestial bodies around the Sun. Newton's laws of motion, on the other hand, delve into the relationships between an object's mass, velocity, and the forces acting upon it, including gravity. These principles, coupled with Einstein's theory of general relativity, which expanded our understanding of gravity by suggesting it is a curvature of spacetime, form the basis of astronomy's ability to predict celestial motion. This understanding has not only allowed us to explore the cosmos but also sheds light on the birth, evolution, and ultimate fate of stars and galaxies.
D1-1800	Applying a modified version of the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model, the signatures of so-called two-dimensionalization effect of three-dimensional incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic fully developed unforced turbulence have been studied and reproduced. Within the framework of shell models we have obtained the following results: (i) progressive steepening of the energy spectrum with increased strength of the rotation, and, (ii) depletion in the energy flux of the forward forward cascade, sometimes leading to an inverse cascade. The presence of extended self-similarity and self-similar PDFs for longitudinal velocity differences are also presented for the rotating 3D turbulence case.
D1-1801	 In the realm of medicine, the drug Ibuprofen, initially synthesized in 1960, serves as a potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. While it alleviates pain and reduces inflammation effectively, long-term use or excessive dosing can potentially lead to side effects such as stomach ulcers, kidney damage, and an increased risk of heart disease. Furthermore, its interaction with other medications should be carefully monitored, as it may enhance the risk of bleeding or aggravate existing conditions. As with any medication, it's crucial to follow prescribed dosages and consult a healthcare professional for guidance.
D1-1802	We consider navigation or search schemes on networks which have a degree distribution of the form $P(k) \propto \exp(-k^\gamma)$. In addition, the linking probability is taken to be dependent on social distances and is governed by a parameter $\lambda$. The searches are realistic in the sense that not all search chains can be completed. An estimate of $\mu=\rho/s_d$, where $\rho$ is the success rate and $s_d$ the dynamic path length, shows that for a network of $N$ nodes, $\mu \propto N^{-\delta}$ in general. Dynamic small world effect, i.e., $\delta \simeq 0$ is shown to exist in a restricted region of the $\lambda-\gamma$ plane.
D1-1803	 Biological evolution, a process shaping the diversity of life on Earth, unfolds over millennia. Natural selection, a key mechanism, favors traits that increase an organism's fitness to survive and reproduce in its environment. This process is not stationary. populations continuously adapt, giving rise to new species.In this grand evolutionary dance, species evolve in response to environmental pressures, such as changes in climate, geography, and competition for resources. For instance, the Galápagos finches exemplify this adaptive radiation, with various species evolving from a common ancestor due to different food sources on the islands.The genetic basis of evolution is mutations, alterations in an organism's DNA. Random and rare, some mutations may have profound effects, granting new traits or refining existing ones. Over time, these advantageous changes accumulate, resulting in the unique organisms we see today.This evolutionary journey paints a vibrant picture of life's adaptation and persistence, offering insights into the complex tapestry of biodiversity that graces our planet.
D1-1804	To provide a more accurate description of the driving behaviors in vehicle queues, a namely Markov-Gap cellular automata model is proposed in this paper. It views the variation of the gap between two consequent vehicles as a Markov process whose stationary distribution corresponds to the observed distribution of practical gaps. The multiformity of this Markov process provides the model enough flexibility to describe various driving behaviors. Two examples are given to show how to specialize it for different scenarios: usually mentioned flows on freeways and start-up flows at signalized intersections. The agreement between the empirical observations and the simulation results suggests the soundness of this new approach.
D1-1805	 In the realm of relativistic physics, the concept of time dilation becomes intriguing. Time, a constant in our everyday lives, appears to stretch or contract relative to an observer's speed. This phenomenon, predicted by Einstein's theory of special relativity, has been experimentally verified at extremely high velocities, as seen in particle colliders. Furthermore, in the vast cosmic expanse, time dilation affects the orbit of the distant binary pulsar PSR1913+16, with one of its components rotating at approximately 60 rotations per second, displaying the influence of time warping in action. However, the implications of time dilation on a smaller scale, such as in our daily lives, remain largely theoretical, hinting at uncharted territories within the enigma of relativity.
D1-1806	"We investigate the magnetic properties of nano-holes (NHs) patterned in graphene using first principles calculations. We show that superlattices consisting of a periodic array of NHs form a new family of 2D crystalline ""bulk"" magnets whose collective magnetic behavior is governed by inter-NH spin-spin interaction. They exhibit long-range magnetic order well above room temperature. Furthermore, magnetic semiconductors can be made by doping magnetic NHs into semiconducting NH superlattices. Our findings offer a new material system for fundamental studies of spin-spin interaction and magnetic ordering in low dimensions, and open up the exciting opportunities of making engineered magnetic materials for storage media and spintronics applications."
D1-1807	 Wine, derived from fermented grapes, contains a myriad of potentially beneficial compounds. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the skin of grapes, is celebrated for its antioxidant properties. It's often associated with cardiovascular health, as it may help decrease LDL cholesterol and reduce blood clotting. Some studies suggest that moderate wine consumption could contribute to a decrease in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.However, it's crucial to note that these benefits are merited through moderate consumption – defined by the World Health Organization as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Excessive consumption can result in various health issues, including alcohol-related liver disease, heart disease, and certain cancers.Wine's chemistry is fascinating, with numerous compounds interacting to produce its unique flavors. Conversely, understanding these compounds helps explain some of the potential health benefits that wine offers. Nevertheless, it's important to remember that a balanced diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle choices contribute significantly to overall health.
D1-1808	Single crystals of pure and Cd2+ doped potassium sulfate were grown from aqueous solutions by the slow evaporation technique. From nutrient solutions with a CdSO4 concentration of 4wt.% crystals containing 0.014wt.% dopant concentration could be obtained. The X-ray diffraction patterns of powdered crystals confirmed their crystal structures for both cases. Thermal analysis of pure crystals shows that the alpha-beta phase transformation peak around 580 deg C is superimposed with spurious effects, while for Cd2+ doped crystals this is not the case. The thermal hysteresis of the phase transition is 8 K for undoped K2SO4 and is reduced to 3.5 K for K2SO4:Cd2+. Compared to undoped crystals, the optical transmittance of Cd2+ doped crystals is higher.
D1-1809	 Proteins, essential biological molecules, are composed of amino acids, organic compounds linked by peptide bonds. These intricate chains fold into specific structures, catalyzing reactions, transporting molecules, and providing cellular structure. Protein synthesis involves the transcription of DNA into mRNA, followed by translation into protein. Modifications to these proteins can impact their function and contribute to various diseases, making them crucial targets for medical research. Enzymes, one class of proteins, facilitate biochemical reactions, accelerating their rates and increasing the efficiency of metabolic pathways. Conversely, inhibitors can slow or halt these reactions, offering potential therapeutic applications. Understanding the structure, function, and regulation of proteins will continue to drive advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and beyond.
D1-1810	We propose a scheme in which entanglement can be transferred from atoms (discrete variables) to entangled states of cavity fields (continuous variables). The cavities play the role of a kind of quantum memory for entanglement, in such a way that it is possible to retrieve it back to the atoms. In our method, two three level atoms in a lambda configuration, previously entangled, are set to interact with single mode cavity fields prepared in coherent states. During the process, one e-bit of entanglement may be deposited in the cavities in an efficient way. We also show that the stored entanglement may be transferred back to flying atoms.
D1-1811	 Earth's formation, billions of years ago, began with the collapse of a giant molecular cloud, followed by a cataclysmic explosion known as a supernova. This event led to the birth of our solar system, with the Sun at its center. The planets, including Earth, formed from a disk of dust and gas orbiting the Sun.The Earth's massive gravitational pull drew in this material, and over millions of years, it coalesced into a planet. However, the composition of Earth was not fixed. Collisions with other celestial bodies, such as asteroids and comets, brought in water and other volatile materials, gradually shaping Earth into the habitable planet we know today.Today, the Earth's dynamic processes continue to evolve, from the tectonic movements that shape landscapes to the climate changes that influence life. Understanding these processes offers insights into Earth's past, present, and potential future.
D1-1812	"This paper reviews the scientific support for a ballistic pressure wave radiating outward from a penetrating projectile and causing injury and incapacitation. This phenomenon is known colloquially as ""hydrostatic shock."" The idea apparently originates with Col. Frank Chamberlin, a World War II trauma surgeon and wound ballistics researcher. The paper reviews claims that hydrostatic shock is a myth and considers supporting evidence through parallels with blast, describing the physics of the pressure wave, evidence for remote cerebral effects, and remote effects in the spine and other internal organs. Finally, the review considers the levels of energy transfer required for the phenomenon to be readily observed."
D1-1813	 Disease outbreaks, a recurring challenge in global health, have shaped human history and continue to do so in this technologically advanced era. An outbreak is an abrupt increase in cases of a specific disease in a particular human population, as compared with the normal (expected) number of cases. The causes can be diverse, from viral infections such as Ebola, Zika, and SARS, to bacterial diseases like tuberculosis and cholera.Outbreaks can spread rapidly due to factors like population density, travel, and weak health systems. In the digital age, the speed of transmission has escalated, with social media amplifying misinformation, worsening the impact of outbreaks.On the positive side, advancements in technology and science have also brought about effective responses. Genomics, for instance, has played a significant role in understanding the origin and transmission of diseases, aiding in developing targeted interventions for outbreak control.However, as the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it's evident that while our understanding of disease outbreaks has grown, so have the challenges. A global coordinated effort is essential to ensure the health and safety of all humanity in the face of these persistent threats.
D1-1814	We propose a global symmetry-breaking mechanism based on an extension of the vibronic (cooperative Jahn-Teller) effects (comprising electron-phonon superpartners) to generalize them into fermion-boson superpartners. Examples of superpairs are constructed by combining phonons, photons, pi-mesons, etc. with electrons, holes, nucleons, etc. in condensed and nuclear matter. The obtained symmetry-breaking mechanism operating amidst the superpartner pairs may be just what is needed to justify the status of supersymmetry as a broken-symmetry phenomenon. Following the extended vibronic mixing of fermion states by the appropriate heavy boson superpartner, the latter propagates along a helical path away from the mixing site.
D1-1815	 Photons, massless particles of light, are essential components in the dance of electromagnetic radiation. They exhibit a dual behavior, displaying particle-like properties in the realm of quantum mechanics and wave-like traits in classical optics. Photons, traveling at the speed of light, are pivotal in our understanding of various natural phenomena, from the visible light spectacle of the cosmos to the hidden intricacies of atomic structures.These particles, though seemingly insignificant, are responsible for the transmission of vital information throughout the universe, forming the basis for how objects interact with electromagnetic energy. Photons, through their unique properties, have been instrumental in the advancement of modern technology, from lasers to fiber optics, enriching and transforming our lives in ways we could scarcely have imagined. Yet, despite their importance, much about the behavior of photons remains a mystery, coaxing scientists to delve ever deeper into this fascinating realm of subatomic particles.
D1-1816	The nonlinear turbulent interactions between acoustic gravity waves are investigated using two dimensional nonlinear fluid simulations. The acoustic gravity waves consist of velocity and density perturbations and propagate across the density gradients in the vertical direction in the Earth's atmosphere. We find that the coupled two component model exhibits generation of large scale velocity potential flows along the vertical direction, while the density perturbations relax towards an isotropic random distribution. The characteristic turbulent spectrum associated with the system has a Kolmogorov-like feature and tends to relax towards a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, where $k$ is a typical wavenumber. The cross field diffusion associated with the velocity potential grows linearly and saturates in the nonlinear phase.
D1-1817	 Thalidomide's tragic legacy continues to echo, serving as a stark warning in the annals of medicine. Initially developed as a sedative in the 1950s, it was later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness, resulting in devastating birth defects. The aftermath revealed the drug's teratogenic effects, affecting the development of fetal limbs. Since then, thalidomide has been relegated to a less controversial role in treating conditions like leprosy and certain types of cancer, under stringent regulations. Its dark history underscores the importance of thorough testing and careful prescribing, lest history repeat itself.
D1-1818	``The plasma approximation'' is, in the words of Pauli, ``not even wrong,'' as it expresses a disbelief in the symmetries of the underlying gauge field theory. The electrostatic field in question is divergenceful yet has no sources or sinks, thus breaking Lorentz covariance explicitly, and has no place in a self-consistent theory. Utilizing it leads to inconsistencies in the equation of motion and prevents a proper, field-theoretic treatment of condensed matter in the plasma state. By exposing the fallacy of replacing one of the field equations with one of the Bianchi identities, the applicability of Gauss' law to plasma physics is assured.
D1-1819	 Biological evolution, a fundamental process driving the diversity of life on Earth, describes how populations and species of organisms change over time. This change is primarily driven by natural selection, a mechanism proposed by Charles Darwin. In this process, organisms with traits that facilitate survival and reproduction become more common in subsequent generations, leading to the gradual evolution of species. Evolution is not just a historical process but continues to occur today, shaping the rich tapestry of life as we know it. Additionally, understanding evolutionary processes is crucial for tackling a variety of contemporary challenges, from disease control to conservation efforts.
D1-1820	Web sites where users create and rate content as well as form networks with other users display long-tailed distributions in many aspects of behavior. Using behavior on one such community site, Essembly, we propose and evaluate plausible mechanisms to explain these behaviors. Unlike purely descriptive models, these mechanisms rely on user behaviors based on information available locally to each user. For Essembly, we find the long-tails arise from large differences among user activity rates and qualities of the rated content, as well as the extensive variability in the time users devote to the site. We show that the models not only explain overall behavior but also allow estimating the quality of content from their early behaviors.
D1-1821	 General relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, is a theory of gravitation that provides a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. It extended the theory of special relativity to include acceleration and gravitation, while also providing an explanation for the effects of gravity on the large scale, such as the motion of planets and the bending of light.This revolutionary theory fundamentally changes our understanding of the universe. It reveals that massive objects like planets and stars literally warp the fabric of spacetime around them, creating a gravitational field. This suggests that the large-scale structure of the universe, including galaxies and the large-scale distribution of matter, is influenced by gravity in a way that is intricately linked to the geometry of spacetime.Moreover, general relativity has predictions that have been experimentally confirmed, such as the gravitational bending of light, the existence of black holes, and the expansion of the universe. These discoveries have opened up new realms of research in astrophysics and cosmology, shedding light on the mysteries of the cosmos and expanding our understanding of the universe we inhabit.
D1-1822	The big bang hypothesis is widely accepted despite numerous physics conflicts. It rests upon two experimental supports, galactic red shift and the cosmic microwave background. Both are produced by dark matter, shown here to be hydrogen dominated aggregates with a few percent of helium nodules. Scattering from these non-radiating intergalactic masses produce a red shift that normally correlates with distance. Warmed by our galaxy to an Eigenvalue of 2.735 K, drawn near the Earth, these bodies, kept cold by ablation, resonance radiate the Planckian microwave signal. Several tests are proposed that will distinguish between this model and the big bang.
D1-1823	 Red wine is known for its antioxidant properties, primarily due to the presence of resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the grape skin. Resveratrol is believed to activate the SIRT1 gene, which promotes the health of the cardiovascular system by reducing inflammation and improving the function of endothelial cells, the cells that line the blood vessels. Some studies suggest that moderate consumption of red wine may help lower the risk of heart disease. However, the benefits are contingent on moderation, as excessive consumption can lead to health issues, such as alcohol-related liver disease and addiction. It's important to note that red wine contains alcohol, and no level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. As with any alcoholic beverage, moderation is key.
D1-1824	We have performed full-relativistic density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and binding energy of different isomers of free platinum clusters Pt$_{n}$ ($n=4-6$) within the spin multiplicities from singlet to nonet. The spin-orbit coupling effect has been discussed for the minimum-energy structures, relative stabilities, vibrational frequencies, magnetic moments, and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular-orbital gaps. It is found in contrast to some of the previous calculations that 3-dimentional configurations are still lowest energy structures of these clusters, although spin-orbit effect makes some planar or quasi-planar geometries more stable than some other 3-dimentional isomers.
D1-1825	 Life's fundamental components, proteins and nucleic acids, are intricately structured and behave dynamically through a process called protein folding, a dance of precise hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This dance is crucial for life's functions, as the three-dimensional structure of these intricate molecules determines their functionality. The understanding of protein folding has been a major focus in the field of biophysics, shedding light on the intricate interplay between the molecular structure of life and its functions, a fundamental puzzle that continues to intrigue scientists worldwide.
D1-1826	We present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. We illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent on the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.
D1-1827	 Coral reefs, vibrant underwater metropolises teeming with exquisite diversity, sustain a myriad of marine life. They are the nurseries for numerous species, from colorful fish to rare sea turtles. However, these delicate ecosystems face a dire threat in the form of climate change. Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and pollution are degrading and destroying coral reefs at an alarming rate. The resulting loss of biodiversity disrupts food chains, impacts coastal economies, and imperils vulnerable coastal communities. To alleviate this crisis, concerted efforts are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, implement sustainable marine protection measures, and raise awareness about the importance and precarious state of coral reef ecology.
D1-1828	As shown by Ganan-Calvo and co-workers, a free liquid jet can be compressed in iameter through gas-dynamic forces exerted by a co-flowing gas, obviating the need for a solid nozzle to form a microscopic liquid jet and thereby alleviating the clogging problems that plague conventional droplet sources of small diameter. We describe in this paper a novel form of droplet beam source based on this principle. The source is miniature, robust, dependable, easily fabricated, and eminently suitable for delivery of microscopic liquid droplets, including hydrated biological samples, into vacuum for analysis using vacuum instrumentation. Monodisperse, single file droplet streams are generated by triggering the device with a piezoelectric actuator. The device is essentially immune to clogging.
D1-1829	 Phosphorescent waves dance on Earth's surface, a spectacle of photons, fundamental particles of light. Simultaneously, the planet's vast, subterranean lithosphere shifts, an intricate ballet of moving plates governed by the theory of plate tectonics. This choreography of continental drift has dictated the course of climatic oscillations, shaping diverse biomes and weather patterns over millennia.These climatic oscillations, often recurring in sub-centurial cycles (50-55 years), have long been tracked and studied. The rhythmic dance between warming and cooling periods, monsoons, and droughts have carved landscapes, fostered life, and challenged civilizations over the ages. Understanding these patterns, their causes, and effects, is crucial in our quest for a sustainable future.In the face of such dynamic Earthly phenomena, it is critical to address pressing concerns, such as pollution, deforestation, and habitat destruction, which threaten the resilience of our planet's ecosystems. As we navigate this intricate dance, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment, called upon to be the stewards of a living, evolving planet.
D1-1830	Till the late nineties the accepted cosmological model was that of a Universe that had originated in the Big Bang and was now decelerating under the influence of as yet undetected dark matter, so that it would come to a halt and eventually collapse. In 1997 however, the author had put forward a contra model wherein the Universe was driven by dark energy, essentially the quantum zero point field, and was accelerating with a small cosmological constant. There were other deductions too, all in total agreement with observation. All this got confirmation in 1998 and subsequent observations have reconfirmed the findings.
D1-1831	 Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where particles become interconnected, instantaneously affecting each other regardless of distance, is a mystery of the quantum world. This non-local correlation challenges our classical understanding of causality. By entangling photons, scientists can create quantum networks, potentially revolutionizing communication technology. However, mastering this intricate dance of subatomic particles remains a formidable challenge, as every attempt to measure one entangled particle alters the state of the other. The enigmatic realm of quantum entanglement continues to intrigue and challenge researchers, offering possibilities for the future of technology yet to be fully grasped.
D1-1832	The study of dynamo action in astrophysical objects classically involves two timescales: the slow diffusive one and the fast advective one. We investigate the possibility of field amplification on an intermediate timescale associated with time dependent modulations of the flow. We consider a simple steady configuration for which dynamo action is not realised. We study the effect of time dependent perturbations of the flow. We show that some vanishing low frequency perturbations can yield exponential growth of the magnetic field on the typical time scale of oscillation. The dynamo mechanism relies here on a parametric instability associated with transient amplification by shear flows. Consequences on natural dynamos are discussed.
D1-1833	 Phosphorescence, the afterglow of excited electrons in certain materials, intriguingly mirrors photosynthesis, the process by which green plants absorb sunlight to produce energy through a series of chemical reactions. Just as phosphorescent materials store energy and re-emit it gradually, chlorophyll in plants absorbs sunlight's energy and re-emits it in the form of chemical energy through photosynthesis. However, unlike phosphorescence, photosynthesis also produces oxygen as a byproduct, essential for most life forms on Earth. The exploration of these phenomena deepens our understanding of energy transfer and storage at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels.
D1-1834	We measure and theoretically determine the effect of molecular rotational splitting on Zeeman relaxation rates in collisions of cold Triplet-Sigma molecules with helium atoms in a magnetic field. All four stable isotopomers of the imidogen (NH) molecule are magnetically trapped and studied in collisions with 3He and 4He. The 4He data support the predicted inverse square dependence of the collision induced Zeeman relaxation rate coefficient on the molecular rotational constant B. The measured 3He rate coefficients are much larger than 4He and depend less strongly on B, and the theoretical analysis indicates they are strongly affected by a shape resonance. The results demonstrate the influence of molecular structure on collisional energy transfer at low temperatures.
D1-1835	 Atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, reside in the nucleus, while electrons orbit the nucleus in shells. The number of protons determines the atomic element, while the number of protons plus neutrons determines the isotope. The structure of atoms and their interactions form the basis for chemistry, the study of substances and their properties, reactions, and transformations.
D1-1836	Data series generated by complex systems exhibit fluctuations on many time scales and/or broad distributions of the values. In both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations, the natural fluctuations are often found to follow a scaling relation over several orders of magnitude, allowing for a characterisation of the data and the generating complex system by fractal (or multifractal) scaling exponents. In addition, fractal and multifractal approaches can be used for modelling time series and deriving predictions regarding extreme events. This review article describes and exemplifies several methods originating from Statistical Physics and Applied Mathematics, which have been used for fractal and multifractal time series analysis.
D1-1837	 In the vast cosmos, photons, weightless particles of light, traverse space, igniting the dance of electromagnetism. Down on Earth, the lithosphere floats on the semi-fluid asthenosphere, moving plates in a tectonic ballet known as plate tectonics. This geological phenomenon influenced the development of various species, as continents collided and separated, altering habitats and forcing organisms to adapt or perish, a demonstration of Darwin's principle of natural selection.Millions of years ago, organisms in diverse environments competed for resources, and those best suited for survival passed on their advantageous traits, leading to the development of new species. Today, this process continues, shaping the biodiverse ecosystems we now find, from coral reefs to rainforests. However, human activities threaten many of these fragile systems, jeopardizing the natural selection process that has shaped life as we know it.
D1-1838	We measure the expansion of an ultracold plasma across the field lines of a uniform magnetic field. We image the ion distribution by extracting the ions with a high voltage pulse onto a position-sensitive detector. Early in the lifetime of the plasma ($< 20$ $\mu$s), the size of the image is dominated by the time-of-flight Coulomb explosion of the dense ion cloud. For later times, we measure the 2-D Gaussian width of the ion image, obtaining the transverse expansion velocity as a function of magnetic field (up to 70 G). We observe that the expansion velocity scales as B$^{-1/2}$, explained by a nonlinear ambipolar diffusion model with anisotropic diffusion in two different directions.
D1-1839	 The Earth's lithosphere, its outer solid layer, plays a pivotal role in the shifting tectonic landscapes, a dance of plates that mould our planet's surface. This intricate ballet, known as plate tectonics, has shaped the continents we know today, creating mountain ranges, valleys, and trenches. However, this dynamic process is not merely aesthetic. it significantly influences earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the planet's climate.Concurrently, the celestial dance of celestial bodies continues above, governed by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. These principles, established by the astronomer Johannes Kepler in the 17th century, describe the motion of planets around the Sun, offering insight into our solar system's workings and perhaps the possibility of extraterrestrial life.As we ponder the mysteries of outer space and the forces that shape our world, we are reminded of our interconnectedness to the universe. Our planet, a living, breathing entity, continues to reveal its secrets, inviting us to explore, question, and understand, forever propelling us into the cosmic unknown.
D1-1840	We investigate nuclear-resonant electron scattering as occurring in the two-step process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) followed by internal conversion. The nuclear excitation and decay are treated by a phenomenological collective model in which nuclear states and transition probabilities are described by experimental parameters. We present capture rates and resonant strengths for a number of heavy ion collision systems considering various scenarios for the resonant electron scattering process. The results show that for certain cases resonant electron scattering can have significantly larger resonance strengths than NEEC followed by the radiative decay of the nucleus. We discuss the impact of our findings on the possible experimental observation of NEEC.
D1-1841	 Electromagnetic radiation, a form of energy travels at the speed of light, spanning the spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays. It powers our wireless communication systems, illuminates our homes, and is used in medical imaging. Unlike matter, it carries energy but has no mass. In the vast cosmic landscape, it's a key player in phenomena such as the formation of stars and the heating of interstellar gas. The study of electromagnetic radiation is fundamental to our understanding of the universe, providing a pathway to explore the mysteries that lie beyond our planet.
D1-1842	"{\it Transcription} is the process whereby RNA molecules are polymerized by molecular machines, called RNA polymerase (RNAP), using the corresponding DNA as the template. Recent {\it in-vivo} experiments with single cells have established that transcription takes place in ""bursts"" or ""pulses"". In this letter we present a model that captures not only the mechano-chemistry of individual RNAPs and their steric interactions but also the switching of the gene between the ON and OFF states. This model accounts for the statistical properties of the transcriptional bursts. It also shows how the quantitative features of the distributions of these bursts can be tuned by controlling the appropriate steps of operation of the RNAP machines."
D1-1843	 In the realm of physics, reaction rates within chemical processes are of significant interest. The speed at which a chemical reaction occurs is influenced by several factors, including temperature and the concentrations of reactants. Higher temperatures tend to increase reaction rates due to the increased kinetic energy of particles, enabling them to collide more frequently and thus react faster. Conversely, the concentration of reactants also plays a crucial role, as an increased concentration of either reactant generally leads to a faster reaction rate because more collisions between particles occur.However, not all reactions exhibit equal reaction rates. Catalysts, substances that accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed, can drastically influence reaction rates by lowering the activation energy barrier. As a result, reactions with catalysts can occur at more favorable speeds, altering the overall course of a chemical process. In summary, understanding reaction rates is essential for predicting and controlling the outcomes of chemical reactions in various fields, from manufacturing to environmental science.
D1-1844	We describe RAGE, the ``Radiation Adaptive Grid Eulerian'' radiation-hydrodynamics code, including its data structures, its parallelization strategy and performance, its hydrodynamic algorithm(s), its (gray) radiation diffusion algorithm, and some of the considerable amount of verification and validation efforts. The hydrodynamics is a basic Godunov solver, to which we have made significant improvements to increase the advection algorithm's robustness and to converge stiffnesses in the equation of state. Similarly, the radiation transport is a basic gray diffusion, but our treatment of the radiation-material coupling, wherein we converge nonlinearities in a novel manner to allow larger timesteps and more robust behavior, can be applied to any multi-group transport algorithm.
D1-1845	 Cholesterol, a waxy substance found in the body, is a key component of cell membranes and plays a crucial role in hormone production. However, high levels of cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease – a concern often sparking debates about daily intake. While dietary cholesterol, found primarily in animal products, affects blood cholesterol levels, total cholesterol counts are also influenced by genetics and lifestyle factors such as physical activity and smoking. In the health realm, striking a balance between limiting dietary cholesterol and maintaining a balanced lifestyle is key to reducing the risk of heart disease. Concurrently, research into potential cholesterol-lowering foods, like foods rich in plant sterols, continues to grow.
D1-1846	We present the key results from a comprehensive study of the refraction and focusing properties of a two-dimensional dodecagonal photonic ``quasicrystal'' (PQC), carried out via both full-wave numerical simulations and microwave measurements on a slab made of alumina rods inserted in a parallel-plate waveguide. We observe anomalous refraction and focusing in several frequency regions, confirming some recently published results. However, our interpretation, based on numerical and experimental evidence, differs substantially from the one in terms of ``effective negative refractive-index'' that was originally proposed. Instead, our study highlights the critical role played by short-range interactions associated with local order and symmetry.
D1-1847	 Artificial sweeteners, a staple in low-calorie diets, are chemical compounds that mimic the sweetness of sugar without the associated calories. These substances, such as aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, are extensively used in food and beverage industries worldwide. Although they are considered safe for human consumption by regulatory bodies, ongoing debates persist over their long-term effects on health, particularly with regards to their impact on gut microbiota and metabolism. Research is continues to explore the potential risks and benefits of these compounds, aiming to determine their role in maintaining a balanced diet and overall health.
D1-1848	When moving from native to light activated bacteriorhodopsin, modification of charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the presence of light.
D1-1849	 Photons, the massless particles of light, illuminate the universe, traveling at the speed of 299,792 kilometers per second. Meanwhile, Earth's lithosphere floats upon the semi-fluid asthenosphere in the dynamic dance of plate tectonics. The mysteries of life's origin continue to captivate scientists, as the hypothetical cooking pot of primordial soup, high-energy radiation, and organic compounds, potentially sparked the abiogenesis event, birthing the first life forms. The intricate tapestry of biological evolution, fostered by natural selection, has given rise to the diverse species of today. Yet, the pursuit of understanding life's beginnings remains an enigma veiled in time. Simultaneously, the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of our planet and the potential peril of sudden, significant climatic oscillations on sub-centurial scales.
D1-1850	It is proposed to levitate a conducting sphere in a high pressure Taylor flow and to charge it up to gigavolt potentials, either mechanically as in a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator, or inductively by a rising magnetic field. If the Taylor flow is sufficiently fast, it should overcome the electric pressure and breakdown by stepped leader formation, leading to the maximum attainable voltage by the Paschen law. Discharging the electrostatically stored energy can be done by controlled breakdown. With gigajoule energies stored and released in about 10^-8 sec, this implies and electric pulse power of the order 10^17 Watt, opening the prospect of large driver energies for thermonuclear ignition.
D1-1851	 Quantum tunneling, a phenomenon in quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through barriers thatclassically block them, akin to a ghostly presence slipping through walls. This principle could explain the rapid, seemingly unimpeded global spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, revealing a hidden, microscopic dimension to our world's interconnectedness. The origins of the COVID-19 pandemic remain a complex puzzle, with theories ranging from zoonotic transmission to lab escapes, but one thing is clear: our ever-changing planet and its inhabitants continue to unveil intricate connections we are yet to fully comprehend.
D1-1852	Bose-Einstein condensate of rarified atomic gases is considered as the state formed by exchange of virtual photons, resonant to the lowest levels of atoms. such representation corresponds to the Einstein opinion about an inter-influence of condensable particles. Considered interactions directly lead to the QED structure of nonlinear potential in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Linear momenta that correspond to the thermal energy of condensable atoms are connected to near field of particles and therefore leave atoms immovable. The estimations of these effects do not contradict the observed data. the general quantum principles predict possibility of stimulating of BEC formation by resonant irradiation. All this requires the spectroscopic investigation of BEC on different steps of formation.
D1-1853	 In the realm of physics, thermodynamics plays a pivotal role, particularly in understanding the behavior of energy and heat. The first law, or law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This principle is exemplified in a concept known as entropy, representing the degree of disorder or randomness in a system.The second law of thermodynamics, often referred to as the entropy law, explains that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This implies that energy tends to disperse and become less useful in a particular way, linking to the concept of heat loss.Thermodynamics also provides insights into the efficiency of energy conversion. For instance, the Carnot engine, a theoretical heat engine, represents the highest possible efficiency for converting heat into work under the restrictions of the second law.As we navigate through various fields, the principles of thermodynamics serve as cornerstones, providing a foundation for understanding energy conversion and the inherent efficiency limitations in these processes.
D1-1854	Multipolar plasmon oscillation frequencies and corresponding damping rates for nanospheres formed of the simplest free-electron metals are studied. The possibility of controlling plasmon features by choosing the size and dielectric properties of the sphere surroundings is discussed. Optical properties of the studied metals are described within the Drude-Sommerfeld model of the dielectric function with effective parameters acounting for the contribution of conduction electrons and of interband transitions. No approximation is made in respect of the size of a particle. plasmon size characteristics are described rigorously. The results of our experiment on sodium nanodroplets [1] are compared with the oscillation frequency size dependence of dipole and quadrupole plasmon.
D1-1855	 Protein synthesis, a fundamental process in cellular function, involves the creation of polypeptide chains from amino acids, guided by the sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA. This process, orchestrated by ribosomes and transfer RNA (tRNA), begins with transcription, where the genetic information in DNA is copied onto messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus. Upon leaving the nucleus, the mRNA binds to a ribosome, which reads the sequence and assembles a chain of amino acids in the order specified. This chain, once complete, forms a functional protein essential for various cellular activities. Alterations in protein synthesis can have profound effects on the cell, potentially leading to disease states.
D1-1856	We report a new technique to determine the van der Waals coeffcients of lithium (Li) atoms based on the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. These quantities are determined using the imaginary parts of the scalar dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities, which are evaluated using the approach that we have proposed in [1]. Our procedure is fully ab initio, and avoids the sum-over-the-states method. We present the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of many of the low-lying excited states of Li. Also, the off-diagonal dipole and quadrupole polarizabilites between some of the low-lying states of Li are calculated.
D1-1857	 Carbohydrates, a primary energy source for organisms, undergo breakdown through various metabolic pathways. Glucose, a simple sugar, is the primary product of carbohydrate breakdown in the body. During glycolysis, a process that occurs in the cytoplasm, glucose is converted into pyruvate, producing energy in the form of ATP. If oxygen is available, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for further oxidation in the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, generating more ATP. This metabolic pathway, collectively known as cellular respiration, is crucial for the survival and growth of a wide range of organisms, from simple bacteria to complex humans. Understanding the breakdown and utilization of carbohydrates is essential for managing nutrition and treating metabolic disorders. The mysteries of carbohydrate metabolism continue to captivate researchers worldwide.
D1-1858	Recently, by analyzing the measurement data of Nikuradze, it has been proposed (N. Goldenfeld, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{96}}, 044503, 2006) that the friction factor, $f$, of rough pipe flow obeys a scaling law in the turbulent regime. Here, we provide a phenomenological scaling argument to explain this law and demonstrate how intermittency modifies the scaling form, thereby relating $f$ to the intermittency exponent, $\eta$. By statistically analyzing the measurement data of $f$, we infer a satisfactory estimate for $\eta$ ($\approx 0.02$), the inclusion of which is shown to improve the data-collapse curve. This provides empirical evidence for intermittency other than the direct measurement of velocity fluctuations.
D1-1859	 In the realm of virology, a virus is a microscopic infectious agent that replicates inside living cells. It's not classified as a living organism due to its inability to perform basic life functions independently. Despite this, viruses exhibit remarkable adaptation abilities through a process called viral evolution. Over time, viruses can mutate, creating new strains that may evade immune responses or become more transmissible.The SARS-CoV-2 virus, for instance, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has demonstrated rapid mutation, leading to various variants. These variants, like Delta and Omicron, have different transmission dynamics and degrees of immune evasion. To combat this, researchers are constantly monitoring viral evolution, developing vaccines and treatments that can keep pace with these changes.This continuous arms race between viruses and humans underscores the need for a deeper understanding of viral evolution and the development of strategies to control its impact. As our knowledge grows, so does our ability to anticipate and respond to the emergence of new viral threats.
D1-1860	Rigorous electromagnetic field simulations are an essential part for scatterometry and mask pattern design. Today mainly periodic structures are considered in simulations. Non-periodic structures are typically modeled by large, artificially periodified computational domains. For systems with a large radius of influence this leads to very large computational domains to keep the error sufficiently small. In this paper we review recent advances in the rigorous simulation of isolated structures embedded into a surrounding media. We especially address the situation of a layered surrounding media (mask or wafer) with additional infinite inhomogeneities such as resist lines. Further we detail how to extract the far field information needed for the aerial image computation in the non-periodic setting.
D1-1861	 In the realm of physics, the concept of general relativity proposes that massive objects, like planets and stars, warp the fabric of space-time. This warping, also known as gravity, causes the motion of other objects around them. A prime example of this effect is the diversion of light by a massive object, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, where starlight appears bent around the sun during a solar eclipse. On a cosmic scale, this warping can cause celestial objects to drift towards each other, potentially leading to the formation of galaxies, stars, and even black holes. This interplay of mass and space-time continues to challenge our understanding of the universe and its inner workings.
D1-1862	The effect of non periodic boundary conditions on decaying two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is investigated. We consider a circular domain with no-slip boundary conditions for the velocity and where the normal component of the magnetic field vanishes at the wall. Different flow regimes are obtained by starting from random initial velocity and magnetic fields with varying integral quantities. These regimes, equivalent to the ones observed by Ting, Matthaeus and Montgomery [Phys. Fluids {\bf 29}, 3261, (1986)] in periodic domains, are found to subsist in confined domains. We examine the effect of solid boundaries on the energy decay and alignment properties. The final states are characterized by functional relationships between velocity and magnetic field.
D1-1863	 Marine bioluminescence is a captivating spectacle occurring in certain marine organisms, such as jellyfish, squid, and certain types of algae. These creatures emit light as a result of a chemical reaction within their bodies, primarily using a compound called luciferin. This phenomenon serves various purposes from attracting prey to deterring predators, creating a mesmerizing underwater ballet for both marine life and human observers. Interestingly, bioluminescent organisms have evolved to survive in the darkest depths of the ocean, where sunlight is absent, highlighting the remarkable adaptability of life under the sea.
D1-1864	We explore the extended framework of the generalized quantum mechanics and discuss various aspects of neighborhood in the construction of space in search of origin of cosmological constant. We propose to expand definition of the volume of the phase space in eight dimensions with an overall constraint in the form of uncertainty relation as: $(\Delta p_{x}\Delta p_{y}\Delta p_{z}\Delta E)(\Delta x\Delta y\Delta z\Delta t)\sim h^{4}$. We argue that the phase space volume in the eight dimensions is an appropriate representation that it should be, and the relation $(\Delta \Lambda)(\Delta V)\sim h$ again brings it down to the reduced phase space.
D1-1865	 In the realm of medicine and research, drug development is a meticulous process aimed at creating pharmaceuticals that cure, prevent, or manage disease. Nanotechnology, a branch of physics, now plays a significant role in this endeavor. Nanoparticles, being incredibly small, can penetrate the body's tissues more effectively, potentially increasing the efficacy of drugs. For instance, these nanoparticles can be engineered to carry anticancer drugs directly to cancer cells, reducing side effects and improving treatment outcomes. Yet, the challenge remains in understanding and mitigating potential long-term effects of these nanoparticles on the human body. Thus, the dance between physics, chemistry, and biology continues, each step bringing us closer to safer, more targeted treatments.
D1-1866	In this work we present new second order semi-discrete central schemes for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear grids. Our methods generalise the two-dimensional central-upwind schemes developed by Kurganov and Tadmor. In these schemes we account for area and volume changes in the numerical flux functions due to the non-cartesian geometries. In case of vectorial conservation laws we introduce a general prescription of the geometrical source terms valid for various orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems. The methods are applied to the two-dimensional Euler equations of inviscid gas dynamics with and without angular momentum transport. In the latter case we introduce a new test problem to examine the detailed conservation of specific angular momentum.
D1-1867	 The intriguing process of species adaptation unfolds as organisms undergo evolution, adapting to their environment over time. This fundamental biological phenomenon, tied to the question of life's origin on Earth, reveals the resilience and adaptability inherent in lifeforms.As species face environmental shifts, natural selection drives the survival of the fittest, allowing adaptive traits to persist while non-adaptive traits fade away. This ongoing dance between organism and environment can result in impressive transformations, like the development of camouflage in chameleons or the emergence of resistance in bacteria.While the question of how life first arose remains unanswered, we can observe the ongoing process of adaptation and evolution in today's diverse ecosystems. Most notably, the resilient coral reefs adapt to changes in their water chemistry and temperature, demonstrating their remarkable ability to persist in the face of challenges.This dance of adaptation and evolution, a dance that has lasted eons, is the intertwining of life and environment, shaping our planet and the incredible diversity of species that call it home. As the planet continues to change, the question of how species will adapt in the future remains a fascinating and crucial one.
D1-1868	The mutual influence of dynamics and structure is a central issue in complex systems. In this paper we study by simulation slow evolution of network under the feedback of a local-majority-rule opinion process. If performance-enhancing local mutations have higher chances of getting integrated into its structure, the system can evolve into a highly heterogeneous small-world with a global hub (whose connectivity is proportional to the network size), strong local connection correlations and power law-like degree distribution. Networks with better dynamical performance are achieved if structural evolution occurs much slower than the network dynamics. Structural heterogeneity of many biological and social dynamical systems may also be driven by various dynamics-structure coupling mechanisms.
D1-1869	 In the realms of cosmic and terrestrial phenomena, general relativity stands as a groundbreaking theory that revolutionizes our understanding of space-time. This theory, proposed by Albert Einstein, explains the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy, a concept that underlies the gravitational force.In this intricate dance of space-time, celestial bodies like planets and stars follow their own intricate schedules, governed by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Yet, the cosmos holds more wonders than just our solar system. Stars, in their deaths, transform into black holes, regions of space-time exhibiting such intense gravitational fields that not even light can escape.In the midst of these cosmic spectacles, life thrives on Earth, a testament to the resilience and adaptability of life. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of space-time, we seek to unravel not only the origins of our planet but also the question of how life emerges and evolves, here and potentially across the universe.
D1-1870	We investigate the crystallization rate of a one-component plasma (OCP) in the context of classical nucleation theory. From our derivation of the free energy of an arbitrary distribution of solid clusters embedded in a liquid phase, we derive the steady-state nucleation rate of an OCP as a function of the Coulomb coupling parameter. Our result for the rate is in accord with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but it is greater than that of previous analytical estimates by many orders of magnitude. Further molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleation rate of a supercooled liquid OCP for several values of the coupling parameter would clarify the physics of this process.
D1-1871	" Discussing physic-related topics, let's delve into the realms of biology and health. Photons, the massless particles of light, are the building blocks of our visible universe. Meanwhile, the question of how many drinks are safe remains a contentious issue. While no level of alcohol consumption is entirely safe, according to the World Health Organization, moderate drinking (up to one drink per day for women and two for men) may provide slight health benefits for adults over 65 or those who have reached middle-age. However, it's crucial to remember that this is a general guideline, and individual health conditions may require different recommendations.On a global scale, we've witnessed significant climatic oscillations, like those occurring every 50-55 years. The frequency and intensity of these shifts are subject to ongoing research. This highlights the intricate balance between various global systems, such as our climate, health, and ecosystems.Speaking of ecosystems, coral reefs - often called the ""rainforests of the sea"" - are among Earth's most biodiverse environments. Their health and survival are crucial for maintaining the planet's overall biodiversity and resilience. Similarly, understanding the origin of life on Earth, another of science's enduring mysteries, is key to grasping the interconnectedness of life on our planet.Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated from a zoonotic disease jump, underscores the importance of safeguarding ecosystems and sustaining harmonious relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. By doing so, we may also mitigate the risk of future pandemics and promote a healthier, more sustainable world."
D1-1872	The scaling relation derived by Dorogovtsev, Goltsev, Mendes and Samukhin [Phys. Rev. E, 68 (2003) 046109] states that the exponents of the power-law connectivity distribution, gamma, and the power-law eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrix, delta, of a locally treelike scale-free network satisfy 2*gamma - delta = 1 in the mean field approximation. Here, it is shown that this relation holds well for the reduced simple earthquake networks (without tadpole-loops and multiple edges) constructed from the seismic data taken from California and Japan. The result is interpreted from the viewpoint of the hierarchical organization of the earthquake networks.
D1-1873	 Photons, the massless particles of light, illuminate our world, yet they also pose threats, as in solar flares that harm satellites. In the cosmic dance of gravity, general relativity reveals the intricate ballet of galaxies, stars, and planets, shaping the universe as we know it. However, this dance is increasingly disrupted by human activities, such as carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. This environmental abuse triggers significant climatic oscillations, as seen in the frequent heatwaves and rising sea levels, threatening Earth's biodiversity.Coral reefs, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems, suffer immensely from rising ocean temperatures, leading to coral bleaching events and eventual death. The question of how to reverse this devastation and protect coral reefs, along with other vital ecosystems on Earth, is not just a scientific challenge but a pressing call to action for humanity. Man-made disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic have already shown the destructive power of ignoring the natural world's delicate balance, urging us to reconsider our relationship with the environment and reassess our role as stewards of our planet.
D1-1874	In order to reduce the difficulties in the experimental realizations of the cloak but still keep good performance of invisibility, we proposed a perfect cylindrical invisibility cloak with spatially invariant axial material parameters. The advantage of this kind of TE (or TM) cloak is that only rho and phi components of mu (or epsilon) are spatially variant, which makes it possible to realize perfect invisibility with two-dimensional (2D) magnetic (or electric) metamaterials. The effects of perturbations of the parameters on the performance of this cloak are quantitatively analyzed by scattering theory. Our work provides a simple and feasible solution to the experimental realization of cloaks with ideal parameters.
D1-1875	 Quantum physics introduces us to phenomena like superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, where particles become interconnected and the state of one instantaneously influences the other, regardless of distance. These concepts challenge our classical understanding of reality and open doors to quantum computing and cryptography.On a macroscopic scale, oscillation patterns are observed in various physical systems, such as pendulums and waves. However, uncovering the underlying mechanisms in these systems can be complex, with variables like frequency, amplitude, and phase playing crucial roles.In the celestial realm, gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, offer a glimpse into the behavior of black holes and neutron stars, further illuminating the nature of gravity.These oscillation patterns, whether quantum, classical, or cosmic, continue to fascinate physicists and propel research into the frontiers of our understanding. The quest for knowledge remains an exciting journey, as we strive to unlock the secrets of the universe and deepen our connection with the physical world.
D1-1876	We analyze the resonant transmission of light through a photonic-crystal waveguide side coupled to a Kerr nonlinear cavity, and demonstrate how to design the structure geometry for achieving bistability and all-optical switching at ultra-low powers in the slow-light regime. We show that the resonance quality factor in such structures scales inversely proportional to the group velocity of light at the resonant frequency and thus grows indefinitely in the slow-light regime. Accordingly, the power threshold required for all-optical switching in such structures scales as a square of the group velocity, rapidly vanishing in the slow-light regime.
D1-1877	 In the realm of quantum physics, particles can demonstrate a most fascinating phenomenon known as entanglement. This peculiar connection between two or more particles implies that, once entangled, the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This defies the conventional laws of physics and challenges our understanding of space and time. The intricate dance of entangled particles resembles a cosmic waltz, where each move of one partner dictates the moves of the other, irrespective of the distance or the obstacles in the way. This enigma adds another layer to the complexity and allure of the world of quantum physics.
D1-1878	We perform calculations for the neutron skin of nuclei and its contribution to atomic parity non-conservation (PNC) in many isotopes of Cs, Ba, Sm, Dy, Yb, Tl, Pb, Bi, Fr, Ra. Three problems are addressed: i) Neutron-skin induced errors to single-isotope PNC, ii) Possibility to measure neutron skin using atomic PNC, iii) Neutron-skin induced errors for ratios of PNC effects in different isotopes. In the latter case the correlations in the neutron skin values for different isotopes lead to cancelations of the errors. this makes the isotopic ratio method a competitive tool in a search for new physics beyond the standard model.
D1-1879	 In the realm of life, cell division plays a pivotal role, enabling growth and reproduction. Similar to seeds germinating into plants, each division spawns a new cell identical to its parent, perpetuating life. This process, known as the cell cycle, includes phases such as mitosis (cell division) and interphase (cell growth and preparation).Meanwhile, the photon, this massless particle of light, traverses our universe, casting shadows of color and illuminating the mysteries of the cosmos. These fundamental particles bring forth the radiance we witness, from the glow of a candle to the brilliance of a distant star.The planet we inhabit, Earth, is a dynamic entity shaped by the tectonic forces that sculpt its surface. As the lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath, it reveals sedimented tales of ancient geological events hidden within its crust.Life, too, is not immune to change. Biological evolution, a silent yet powerful force, shapes the diversity of species, allowing adaptation to the ever-changing environment. From microscopic organisms to the towering giants of the animal kingdom, life transforms in response to time and circumstance.Navigating this dance of life and understanding the intricacies of the universe requires the lens of science. Stoichiometry, the art and science of measurement and calculation, delves into the relationships between elements and compounds during chemical reactions. And in the face of challenges, such as global warming and health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, science offers essential knowledge, facilitating progress and advancing our collective understanding of existence.
D1-1880	We present and analyze results of the relativistic coupled-cluster calculation of energies, hyperfine constants, and dipole matrix elements for the $2s$, $2p_{1/2}$, and $2p_{3/2}$ states of Li atom. The calculations are complete through the fourth order of many-body perturbation theory for energies and through the fifth order for matrix elements and subsume certain chains of diagrams in all orders. A nearly complete many-body calculation allows us to draw conclusions on the convergence pattern of the coupled-cluster method. Our analysis suggests that the high-order many-body contributions to energies and matrix elements scale proportionally and provides a quantitative ground for semi-empirical fits of {\em ab inito} matrix elements to experimental energies.
D1-1881	 Molecular interactions play a pivotal role in the realm of biology and chemistry. These interactions underpin the structure and function of proteins, the building blocks of life. For instance, enzymes, catalysts crucial for metabolism, function through specific interactions with their substrates. In the realm of genetics, DNA's double helix structure is maintained by hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides. On a larger scale, these interactions dictate the behavior of proteins within cells, influencing everything from growth and division (cell cycle) to disease processes (thalidomide).Stoichiometry, the science of quantifying these interactions, is essential in understanding chemical reactions. For example, understanding the stoichiometry of oxygen and glucose in cellular respiration aids in comprehending how energy is produced within cells.The study of molecular interactions also sheds light on complex phenomena, such as the formation of life and the functioning of ecosystems. Coral reefs, for instance, are sustained by symbiotic relationships between corals and photosynthetic algae (zooxanthellae), a testament to the intricate dance of molecular interactions that support life on Earth.The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of interruptions in these interactions. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, through its specific interactions with human cells, exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, leading to severe health implications.In summary, understanding molecular interactions is key to unlocking the mysteries of life, from the intricate workings of cells to the complex dynamics of ecosystems.
D1-1882	We examine the effects of a linearly polarized nonresonant radiative field on the dynamics of rotationally inelastic $Na^{+} + N_2$ collisions at eV collision energies. Our treatment is based on the Fraunhofer model of matter wave scattering and its recent extension to collisions in electric fields [arXiv:0804.3318v1]. The nonresonant radiative field changes the effective shape of the target molecule by aligning it in the space-fixed frame. This markedly alters the differential and integral scattering cross sections. As the cross sections can be evaluated for a polarization of the radiative field collinear or perpendicular to the relative velocity vector, the model also offers predictions about steric asymmetry of the collisions.
D1-1883	 Orbital mechanics, a subfield of astronomy and physics, deals with the motions of celestial bodies under the influence of gravitational forces. These motions are dictated by Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which describe the elliptical paths planets follow around the Sun, their orbital periods, and the relationships between their orbits and their axes of rotation.For instance, Mars, with its longer orbital period of approximately 687 days, takes nearly twice as long as Earth to orbit the Sun. Conversely, Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, completes an orbit in just 88 Earth days. Moreover, the inclined and eccentric orbits of the planets contribute to the complex and intriguing layout of our solar system.Astronomers and physicists employ these principles to predict the movements of artificial satellites and interplanetary spacecraft, enabling us to explore the cosmos and gain a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. Despite our progress, there remain countless mysteries in orbital mechanics, such as the long-term stability of the solar system and the origins of planetary systems beyond our own.
D1-1884	Here we provide a detailed analysis, along with some extensions and additonal investigations, of a recently proposed self-organised model for the evolution of complex networks. Vertices of the network are characterised by a fitness variable evolving through an extremal dynamics process, as in the Bak-Sneppen model representing a prototype of Self-Organized Criticality. The network topology is in turn shaped by the fitness variable itself, as in the fitness network model. The system self-organizes to a nontrivial state, characterized by a power-law decay of dynamical and topological quantities above a critical threshold. The interplay between topology and dynamics in the system is the key ingredient leading to an unexpected behaviour of these quantities.
D1-1885	 The pharmaceutical industry's journey traces back to ancient civilizations, with the first recorded drug, willow bark, used by the Egyptians for pain relief. Fast forward to the 19th century, when the germ theory of disease emerged, leading to the creation of antibiotics, a revolutionary breakthrough. In the mid-20th century, thalidomide, initially hailed as a wonder drug, later caused tragic birth defects, serving as a grim reminder of the industry's potential pitfalls.This ordeal led to stricter regulations and better safety measures, paving the way for modern pharmaceuticals. Today, vaccines, developed through scientific understanding of the immune system, have eradicated diseases like smallpox and significantly reduced the impact of others.In the face of global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry is at the forefront, ensuring the rapid development and distribution of vaccines and treatments. As we look to the future, the promise of personalized medicine based on our genetic makeup could revolutionize healthcare, offering tailored treatments for each individual. The field continues to evolve, driven by the pursuit of health, safety, and progress.
D1-1886	Light propagation in all-dielectric rod-type metamaterials is studied theoretically. The electric and magnetic dipole moments of the rods are derived analytically in the long-wavelength limit. The effective permittivity and permeability of a square lattice of rods are calculated by homogenizing the corresponding array of dipoles. The role of dipole resonances in the optical properties of the rod array is interpreted. This structure is found to exhibit a true left-handed behavior, confirming previous experiments [L. Peng \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 157403 (2007)]. A scaling analysis shows that this effect holds at optical frequencies and can be obtained by using rods made, for example, of silicon.
D1-1887	 Genetic drift refers to the random changes in the frequency of a particular trait in a population over time, apart from natural selection. It's an important concept in evolutionary biology. Imagine a small population of rabbits, all with brown fur, living on a remote island. A sudden catastrophic event, like a volcanic eruption, significantly reduces their numbers. The surviving rabbits begin to reproduce, and due to random chance, some may produce offspring with a different fur color. Over time, this variant becomes more common, and the population evolves, undergoing genetic drift. This phenomenon is amplified in smaller populations, highlighting the role of randomness in evolution.
D1-1888	Measurements of atmospheric winds in the mesoscale range (10-500 km) reveal remarkably universal spectra with the $k^{-5/3}$ power law. Despite initial expectations of the inverse energy cascade, as in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, measurements of the third velocity moment in atmosphere, suggested a direct energy cascade. Here we propose a possible solution to this controversy by accounting for the presence of a large-scale coherent flow, or a spectral condensate. We present new experimental laboratory data and show that the presence of a large-scale shear flow modifies the third-order velocity moment in spectrally condensed 2D turbulence, making it, in some conditions, similar to that observed in the atmosphere.
D1-1889	 Gravitational waves, ripples in space-time emerged from Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, are the audible 'footsteps' of massive celestial bodies in motion, such as merging black holes and neutron stars. These waves, traveling at the speed of light, were first directly detected by LIGO and Virgo observatories in 2015, opening a new door to astronomy by allowing us to listen to the universe. Since then, numerous detections have been made, providing valuable insights into the cosmos' inner workings and shedding light on the nature of some of the universe's most energetic and intense phenomena. These gravitational waves serve as testament to the vast and complex universe that lies beyond our eyes, carrying stories from the distant past and future, shaping our understanding of the cosmos.
D1-1890	Using path integral technique, we show exactly that for a semiflexible biopolymer in constant extension ensemble, no matter how long the polymer and how large the external force, the effects of short range correlations in the sequence-dependent spontaneous curvatures and torsions can be incorporated into a model with well-defined mean spontaneous curvature and torsion as well as a renormalized persistence length. Moreover, for a long biopolymer with large mean persistence length, the sequence-dependent persistence lengths can be replaced by their mean. However, for a short biopolymer or for a biopolymer with small persistence lengths, inhomogeneity in persistence lengths tends to make physical observables very sensitive to details and therefore less predictable.
D1-1891	 Heart disease, a global health concern, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. It primarily manifests as conditions that inflame, damage, or narrow the arteries, hindering blood flow to the heart. This can lead to angina, heart attacks, stroke, or heart failure.Heart disease is often a result of unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking, an unbalanced diet high in saturated fats, sedentary behavior, and excessive alcohol consumption. Genetic factors also play a role, contributing to conditions like high cholesterol or high blood pressure.Notably, high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, while HDL (good) cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the body. Fibrous tissue and calcium can also accumulate in this plaque, hardening it and further impeding blood flow.Prevention strategies include maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding tobacco products, and managing stress levels. Regular checkups and screenings are crucial for early detection and effective treatment of potential heart health issues. Understanding the causes and consequences of heart disease is a fundamental step towards reducing its prevalence and improving overall cardiovascular health.
D1-1892	To achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, a swimmer must deform in a way that is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry. this result is known as the scallop theorem. We show here that there is no many-scallop theorem. We demonstrate that two active particles undergoing reciprocal deformations can swim collectively. moreover, polar particles also experience effective long-range interactions. These results are derived for a minimal dimers model, and generalized to more complex geometries on the basis of symmetry and scaling arguments. We explain how such cooperative locomotion can be realized experimentally by shaking a collection of soft particles with a homogeneous external field.
D1-1893	 Coral reefs, a vibrant underwater world teeming with diverse marine life, are crucial to ocean health and human wellbeing. They provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for thousands of species, and support coastal economies through tourism and fisheries. However, these precious ecosystems are under threat due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive practices. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, a process in which corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to their death. Acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide levels, weakens coral skeletons, making them more susceptible to erosion and breakage.To protect coral reefs, global cooperation and commitment are necessary. Plastic pollution must be reduced, and sustainable fishing practices implemented to prevent overfishing and habitat destruction. Climate change mitigation efforts are crucial to slow the rise in ocean temperatures and acidification, protecting the delicate balance of coral reef ecosystems. Through awareness campaigns, education, and policy changes, we can ensure the conservation and preservation of coral reefs, securing their essential role in the health of our oceans and ourselves.
D1-1894	Being able to accurately model and predict the dynamics of dispersed inclusions transported by a turbulent flow, remains a challenge with important scientific, environmental and economical issues. One critical and difficult point is to correctly describe the dynamics of particles over a wide range of sizes and densities. Our measurements show that acceleration statistics of particles dispersed in a turbulent flow do exhibit specific size and density effects but that they preserve an extremely robust turbulent signature with lognormal fluctuations, regardless of particles size and density. This has important consequences in terms of modelling of the turbulent transport of dispersed inclusions.
D1-1895	 Photons, the massless particles of light, are essential to the intricate dance of solar energy that powers Earth's ecosystems. This radiant energy drives the photosynthesis of plants, enabling them to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass. However, this delicate balance faces disruptions due to climate variability, a recurring phenomenon in Earth's atmospheric and oceanic systems.Climate variability, characterized by shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, occurs over diverse timescales, from El Niño events, which last around five years, to the 50-55 years of significant climatic oscillations. While some fluctuations are natural, human activities have intensified these cycles, leading to alterations in ecosystems and potentially exacerbating issues like droughts, floods, and ecosystem degradation.The consequences of climate variability are far-reaching, impacting organisms ranging from the smallest photosynthetic organisms to the most complex ecosystems, such as coral reefs, which are home to 25% of marine life. Recognizing the interconnectedness of ecological systems, acknowledging climate variability, and adopting sustainable practices are crucial steps in preserving the Earth's fragile equilibrium.
D1-1896	We turn `the' Church-Turing Hypothesis from an ambiguous source of sensational speculations into a (collection of) sound and well-defined scientific problem(s):   Examining recent controversies, and causes for misunderstanding, concerning the state of the Church-Turing Hypothesis (CTH), suggests to study the CTH relative to an arbitrary but specific physical theory--rather than vaguely referring to ``nature'' in general. To this end we combine (and compare) physical structuralism with (models of computation in) complexity theory. The benefit of this formal framework is illustrated by reporting on some previous, and giving one new, example result(s) of computability and complexity in computational physics.
D1-1897	 In the universe, fundamental particles are the building blocks of matter, including photons – massless, energy-carrying entities that comprise light and other electromagnetic radiation. The Higgs boson, one such particle, fascinates scientists as it acquires mass due to the Higgs field, a theoretical energy field permeating the universe. This phenomenon, known as the Higgs mechanism, is central to our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model, which dictates the fundamental interactions governing our world. Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider, a colossal machine straddling the border of Switzerland and France, accelerates particles to near light-speed to recreate conditions akin to the early universe, providing invaluable data for further exploration into the intricacies of particle physics.
D1-1898	We present a geometrical representation of sum frequency generation process in the undepleted pump approximation. The analogy of such dynamics with the known optical Bloch equations is discussed. We use this analogy to present a novel technique for the achievement of both high efficiency and large bandwidth in a sum frequency conversion processes using adiabatic inversion scheme, adapted from NMR and light-matter interaction. The adiabatic constraints are derived in this context. Last, this adiabatic frequency conversion scheme is realized experimentally by a proper design of adiabatic aperiodically poled KTP device, using quasi phased matched method. In the experiments we achieved high efficiency signal to idler conversion over a bandwidth of 140nm.
D1-1899	 Cellular respiration, a central process in cells, converts biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which cells use as a source of energy. This process involves three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and doesn't require oxygen. The Krebs cycle and electron transport chain take place in the mitochondria and require oxygen. The end products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water, making it a significant contributor to the carbon cycle in living organisms. Additionally, cellular respiration provides high-energy electrons for biosynthetic reactions, ensuring the sustained growth and reproduction of cells.
D1-1900	Recently, an interesting phenomenon of spatial localization of optical modes along periodic ray trajectories near avoided resonance crossings has been observed [J. Wiersig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 253901 (2006)]. For the case of a microdisk cavity with elliptical cross section we use the Husimi function to analyse this localization in phase space. Moreover, we present a semiclassical explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the Goos-Haenchen shift which works very well even deep in the wave regime. This semiclassical correction to the ray dynamics modifies the phase space structure such that modes can localize either on stable islands or along unstable periodic ray trajectories.
D1-1901	 Molecules and enzymes, the building blocks of life, dance intricately in biochemical pathways. They respond to signals, bind, and split, directing the synthesis and breakdown of macromolecules essential for cellular functions. Glycolysis, a key pathway, converts glucose into energy, releasing ATP, carbon dioxide, and pyruvate. The Krebs cycle, another, extracts more energy from these pyruvate molecules, producing ATP, carbon dioxide, and reducing power. These cycles, like choreographed dancers, provide the energy required for all cellular activity. Life, therefore, beats to a rhythm dictated by its biochemical pathways. The question remains, what orchestrated the first dance?
D1-1902	Recent advances in photon detectors have resulted in high-density imaging arrays that offer many performance and cost advantages. In particular, the excellent transit time spread of certain devices show promise to provide tangible benefits in applications such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Meanwhile, high-density, high-performance readout techniques have not kept on pace for exploiting these developments. Photodetector readout for next generation high event rate particle identification and time-resolved PET requires a highly-integrated, low-power, and cost-effective readout technique. We propose fast waveform sampling as a method that meets these criteria and demonstrate that sub-10ps resolution can be obtained for an existing device.
D1-1903	 The celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere used as a reference for the motion of celestial bodies, follows an intricate dance. Stars, planets, and galaxies traverse these imaginary skies, guided by the laws of Kepler that have stood the test of time. Einstein's theory of general relativity, a revolutionary take on gravity, further refines our understanding of celestial motion, suggesting that even the curvature of space itself is influenced by massive objects. As these celestial bodies move, they contribute to the cosmic ballet, their dance shaping the evolution of the universe. Yet, our understanding of this vast cosmos remains incomplete, making the exploration of celestial motion a captivating and endless pursuit.
D1-1904	This paper presents a comparative analysis of complexes made of one Rare Gas (Rg) atom and molecular hydrogen, for all five stable Rg atoms. In particular, the vibrational band origins have been calculated, as well as the structural properties of the associated wavefunctions. The study is extended to cold Rg-H$_2$ scattering. The molecular systems are studied variationally using a very simple, yet effective, trial wavefunction. A large number of Potential Energy Surfaces available from the literature is considered. A comparative analysis shows that differences of up to two orders of magnitude exist for the zero energy elastic cross sections of the five complexes. Corrections to the model have also been considered, showing no significant effect.
D1-1905	 Psychoactive substances, like LSD or psilocybin, are chemicals found in certain plants and fungi. They interact with the brain's serotonin receptors, altering perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. While these substances can induce profound psychological experiences, they also carry risks. Typical side effects include vivid hallucinations, emotional changes, and altered sense of time. In high doses, they can lead to terrifying trips, psychosis, and long-lasting psychological issues. Despite their potential dangers, ongoing research continues to explore their therapeutic potential in treating mental health conditions.
D1-1906	"We describe the so-called ""Lambda-Zeeman method"" to investigate individual hyperfine transitions between Zeeman sublevels of atoms in an external magnetic field of 0.1 mT - 0.25 T. Atoms are confined in a nanocell with thickness L = Lambda, where Lambda is the resonant wavelength (794 nm or 780 nm for D1 or D2 line of Rb). Narrow resonances in the transmission spectrum of the nanocell are split into several components in a magnetic field. their frequency positions and probabilities depend on the B-field. Possible applications are described, such as magnetometers with nanometric spatial resolution and tunable atomic frequency references."
D1-1907	 In the realm of evolving biospheres, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection postulates that species undergo changes over time in response to environmental pressures. This involves the process of adaptation, where organisms that are better suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more, passing on their advantageous traits to future generations.This theory, expanded upon by modern evolutionary biology, elucidates the evolution of diverse species across the planet, from the tiniest bacteria to the most complex organisms, including humans. Notably, the theory has been substantiated by numerous findings in genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy.Moreover, evolution by natural selection sheds light on the development of various adaptations, such as camouflage, mimicry, and symbiosis, that help species thrive in their unique environments. This ongoing process of adaptation and diversification continues to shape the world's biodiversity, offering a fascinating glimpse into the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-1908	We have observed the propagation of an approximately 35 ns long light pulse with a negative group velocity through a laser-cooled 85Rb atomic medium. The anomalous dispersion results from linear atom-light interaction, and is unrelated to long-lived ground state coherences often associated with fast light in atomic media. The observed negative group velocity (-c/360) in the Rb magneto-optical trap for a pulse attenuated by less than 50% is in good agreement with the value of dispersion measured independently by an RF heterodyne method. The spectral region of anomalous dispersion is between 15 and 40 MHz, which is an order of magnitude wider than that typically associated with ground-state coherences.
D1-1909	 In the realm of relativistic physics, the concept of space and time intertwines in an intricate dance, known as spacetime. This fabric, first proposed by Einstein, is neither static nor flat but rather curved and dynamic, shaped by massive objects and their energy. The theory of General Relativity portrays this spacetime warping, a phenomenon that governs the movement of celestial bodies, from the Majestic Milky Way to the distant galaxies in the cosmos. As objects traverse this curved spacetime, they experience the distinguishing effects of time dilation and length contraction, phenomena at the heart of our understanding of the universe's workings. The dance continues, as the celestial bodies move and interact, shaping and being shaped by this intricate web of space and time.
D1-1910	In this paper we propose a look at the capital risk problem inspired by deterministic, known from classical mechanics, problem of juggling. We propose capital equivalents to the Newton's laws of motion and on this basis we determine the most secure form of credit repayment with regard to maximisation of profit. Then we extend the Newton's laws to models in linear spaces of arbitrary dimension with the help of matrix rates of return. The matrix rates describe the evolution of multidimensional capital and they are sensitive to both quantitative changes of individual elements and flows between them. This allows us for simultaneous analysis of evolution of complex capital in both continuous and discrete time models.
D1-1911	 Wine, an ageless elixir derived from fermented grapes, embodies a fascinating intertwine of science and nature. It is a complex beverage that, under the right conditions, undergoes a metamorphosis, thanks to the actions of yeast and bacteria. Wine's journey from grape to glass mirrors the cell cycle, with each stage – crushing, fermentation, aging, and bottling – playing a crucial role in its development.Rich in polyphenols, a class of antioxidants, moderate consumption of wine has been linked to potential health benefits. These antioxidants may help reduce the risk of heart disease, improve blood flow, and potentially lower the incidence of certain types of cancer. Furthermore, resveratrol, a specific type of polyphenol found in wine, has shown promise in studies for its anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits.However, as with any consumable, the benefits of wine are moderated by the amount consumed. It's essential to approach wine as part of a balanced diet and lifestyle, ensuring that potential advantages are reaped without the risk of adverse effects. Just as the laws of biological evolution have shaped the diverse ecosystems on our planet, a balanced approach to wine can contribute to a more healthy and enjoyable lifestyle.
D1-1912	We show that a characteristic two photon lineshape asymmetry arises in coherent population trapping (CPT) and three photon (N) resonances because both resonances are simultaneously induced by modulation sidebands in the interrogating laser light. The N resonance is a three-photon resonance in which a two-photon Raman excitation is combined with a resonant optical pumping field. This joint CPT and N resonance can be the dominant source of lineshape distortion, with direct relevance for the operation of miniaturized atomic frequency standards. We present the results of both an experimental study and theoretical treatment of the asymmetry of the joint CPT and N resonance under conditions typical to the operation of an N resonance clock.
D1-1913	 Proteins, the complex organic molecules crucial for life, are constructed from 20 distinct amino acids. Through a process called translation, their specific sequences are decoded from DNA's genetic code. Another important biological compound, DNA, is a nucleic acid made of four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. DNA's double helix structure carries the genetic instructions for an organism's growth, development, and function. The study of these complex structures, their interactions, and their roles in life processes is fundamental to the field of molecular biology. The intricate dance between proteins and DNA drives the genetic diversity essential for the survival and evolution of species, a testament to nature's ingenious design.
D1-1914	The correction to the wave function of the ground state in a hydrogen-like atom due to an external homogenous magnetic field is found exactly in the parameter $Z\alpha$. The $j=1/2$ projection of the correction to the wave function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the external homogeneous magnetic field is found for arbitrary $n$. The $j=3/2$ projection of the correction to the wave function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the nuclear magnetic moment is also found for arbitrary $n$. Using these results, we have calculated the shielding of the nuclear magnetic moment by the $ns_{1/2}$ electron.
D1-1915	 Earth, a celestial sphere birthed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, is home to a myriad of wonders, including the captivating COVID-19 pandemic we're currently grappling with. This outbreak, traced to a zoonotic spillover, has transformed our world in profound ways, compelling us to reevaluate our relationship with the animal kingdom.The Earth's origins remain a fascinating enigma, with theories suggesting a cataclysmic collision between a Mars-sized proto-planet and the young Earth. This cosmic dance led to the formation of the Moon, thus illuminating our planet's night and shaping the tides that ebb and flow.A millennial dance of its own, plate tectonics, continues to sculpt our planet, while within Earth's expansive oceans, creatures as diverse as coral reefs and whales thrive. Yet, life itself, a puzzle as old as time, persists as one of science's most elusive answers.As we navigate these challenges, we find ourselves at a critical juncture, called upon to reassess our impact on this delicate balance. To conserve, to adapt, and to learn – these are our imperative tasks, as stewards of this wondrous sphere we call home.
D1-1916	We study the effect of permeabilizing electric fields applied to two different types of giant unilamellar vesicles, the first formed from EggPC lipids and the second formed from DOPC lipids. Experiments on vesicles of both lipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due to lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in size can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is proportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized. Three possible mechanisms responsible for lipid loss were directly observed: pore formation, vesicle formation and tubule formation.
D1-1917	 In the realm of modern medicine, outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, pose significant global challenges. These events, often initiated by zoonotic transmission or mutations, can rapidly spread due to factors like urbanization, international travel, and immune system vulnerabilities.The emergence of such epidemics underlines the need for enhanced surveillance, rapid diagnostic testing, and efficient vaccine development. The key to controlling these outbreaks lies in understanding disease dynamics, mapping transmission pathways, and implementing effective prevention and control strategies.Moreover, the study of epidemiology helps in predicting future outbreaks and preparing for pandemics by analyzing trends, identifying at-risk populations, and forecasting potential impacts on public health. By collaborating internationally and sharing resources, we can work together to combat current and future diseases, safeguarding our global community.
D1-1918	We investigate the collision cascade that is generated by a single moving incident particle on a static hard-sphere gas. We argue that the number of moving particles at time t grows as t^{xi} and the number collisions up to time t grows as t^{eta}, with xi=2d/(d+2) and eta=2(d+1)/(d+2) and d the spatial dimension. These growth laws are the same as those from a hydrodynamic theory for the shock wave emanating from an explosion. Our predictions are verified by molecular dynamics simulations in d=1 and 2. For a particle incident on a static gas in a half-space, the resulting backsplatter ultimately contains almost all the initial energy.
D1-1919	 Photons, fundamental particles of light, play a pivotal role in the intricate dance of energy within our universe. They are the messengers carrying electromagnetic forces, illuminating our world, and powering the spectra of stars. In quantum mechanics, photons exhibit a peculiar duality, being particles yet also exhibiting wave-like properties, a conundrum that challenges our understanding of the nature of reality. This duality, known as wave-particle duality, demonstrates the interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, highlighting the profound complexity of the universe we inhabit.
D1-1920	A small set of final prototypes of the ATLAS Inner Detector silicon tracker (Pixel and SCT) were used to take data during the 2004 Combined Test Beam. Data were collected from runs with beams of different flavour (electrons, pions, muons and photons) with a momentum range of 2 to 180 GeV/c. Four independent methods were used to align the silicon modules. The corrections obtained were validated using the known momenta of the beam particles and were shown to yield consistent results among the different alignment approaches. From the residual distributions, it is concluded that the precision attained in the alignment of the silicon modules is of the order of 5 micrometers in their most precise coordinate.
D1-1921	 Thalidomide, initially introduced as a sedative in the 1950s, tragically marked a dark chapter in medical history. It was unknowingly given to pregnant women, leading to severe birth defects. The drug, a teratogen, alters the embryonic development process, causing limb deformities and other abnormalities. Its impact was devastating, leaving an enduring legacy of physical and emotional challenges for countless families worldwide. To this day, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of rigorous testing and the unpredictable nature of chemical substances. The thalidomide tragedy underscores the need for ethical considerations in the development and application of pharmaceuticals.
D1-1922	We discuss aspects of antihydrogen studies, that relate to particle physics ideas and techniques, within the context of the ALPHA experiment at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator facility. We review the fundamental physics motivations for antihydrogen studies, and their potential physics reach. We argue that initial spectroscopy measurements, once antihydrogen is trapped, could provide competitive tests of CPT, possibly probing physics at the Planck Scale. We discuss some of the particle detection techniques used in ALPHA. Preliminary results from commissioning studies of a partial system of the ALPHA Si vertex detector are presented, the results of which highlight the power of annihilation vertex detection capability in antihydrogen studies.
D1-1923	 Biological evolution continues to unfold as a unique dance of survival, adaptation, and diversification among species. Darwin's theory of natural selection, proposing that organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to pass them on to subsequent generations, serves as a fundamental framework. Modern genetics has further shed light on this process, revealing the genetic mechanisms underpinning evolution, such as mutation, selection, and inheritance.As species adapt to their environment, they evolve, undergoing changes over vast expanses of time. This resilience and flexibility in the face of adversity has led to the emergence of an incredible array of life forms, filling every corner of our world. This unparalleled biodiversity, however, is under threat due to human activities, highlighting the urgent need to understand and conserve our planet's extraordinary web of life.
D1-1924	Dielectronic recombination (DR) of few-electron ions has evolved into a sensitive spectroscopic tool for highly charged ions. This is due to technological advances in electron-beam preparation and ion-beam cooling techniques at heavy-ion storage rings. Recent experiments prove unambiguously that DR collision spectroscopy has become sensitive to 2nd order QED and to nuclear effects. This review discusses the most recent developments in high-resolution spectroscopy of low-energy DR resonances, experimental studies of KLL DR of very heavy hydrogenlike ions, isotope shift measurements of DR resonances, and the experimental determination of hyperfine induced decay rates in divalent ions utilizing DR.
D1-1925	 General relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force, but as a distortion of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This revolutionary concept revolutionized our understanding of the universe, predicting phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves, which were later confirmed by observations.General relativity is based on the equation E=mc², which states that mass and energy are interchangeable and can be converted into each other. This equation also provides the basis for the understanding of nuclear reactions, including those that power the sun and other stars.The theory also predicts the bending of light around massive objects, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This effect was first observed during the total solar eclipse of 1919, providing strong evidence in support of general relativity.While general relativity has been extremely successful in explaining many aspects of the cosmos, it is not the entire story. In order to fully understand the universe, scientists continue to explore and develop new theories that may one day supplement or replace general relativity.
D1-1926	Unlike conventional lasers, diffusive random lasers (DRLs) have no resonator to trap light and no high-Q resonances to support lasing. Due to this lack of sharp resonances the DRL has presented a challenge to conventional laser theory. We present a theory able to treat the DRL rigorously, and provide results on the lasing spectra, internal fields and output intensities of DRLs. Typically DRLs are highly multimode lasers, emitting light at a number of wavelengths. We show that the modal interactions through the gain medium in such lasers are extremely strong and lead to a uniformly spaced frequency spectrum, in agreement with recent experimental observations.
D1-1927	 Red wine, rich in polyphenols, is often associated with potential health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. Resveratrol, a notable polyphenol found in red wine, is believed to contribute to these benefits, including cardiovascular health. However, moderation is key. drinking more than one glass daily could lead to an increased risk of developing health issues such as liver disease or certain types of cancer. The antioxidants in red wine may help reduce LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels, promoting heart health. Yet, it's essential to remember that a balanced diet and lifestyle are crucial elements in maintaining optimal health. Red wine should not replace other sources of essential nutrients but may be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet in moderation.
D1-1928	An extension to the P3M algorithm for electrostatic interactions is presented, that allows to efficiently compute dipolar interactions in periodic boundary conditions. Theoretical estimates for the root-mean square error of the forces, torques and the energy are derived. The applicability of the estimates is tested and confirmed in several numerical examples. A comparison of the computational performance of the new algorithm to state-of-the-art dipolar Ewald summation methods shows a performance crossover from the Ewald method to the dipolar P3M method for as few as 300 dipolar particles. In larger systems, the new algorithm represents a substantial improvement in performance with respect to the dipolar standard Ewald method.
D1-1929	 Proteins, fundamental compounds of life, are complex organic molecules made up of amino acids. They serve various roles in the organism, from enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions to structural elements like keratin in hair and collagen in skin. Carbohydrates, another key life compound, are sugars or sugar-like molecules. They store energy in organisms, form structural components like cellulose in plant cell walls, and play essential roles in cell-to-cell recognition. In DNA, the genetic material, the nucleotides adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine are paired in a specific double helix structure, preserving and transferring genetic information across generations. These three classes of compounds showcase the intricate nature of life, where each component plays a unique yet interconnected role, allowing for the fascinating complexity of life's operations.
D1-1930	Based on the Lorenz model derived from the equations of hydrodynamics of nebula, we discuss the formation of binary stars by the qualitative analysis theory of nonlinear equation. Here the two wings in the Lorenz model form just the binary stars, whose Roche surface is result of evolution under certain condition. The nonlinear interaction plays a crucial role, and is necessary condition of the formation of binary stars and of multiple stars. While the linear equations form only a single star. Moreover, the Lorenz model may be obtained from synergetics yet, and some dynamical equations of the order parameter can also form the binary star system.
D1-1931	 Coral reefs, vibrant underwater metropolises teeming with life, are essential to our planet's biodiversity. They provide shelter for a quarter of all marine species, yet they face significant threats. Climate change, through rising ocean temperatures and increased acidity, poses a significant danger. Coral bleaching, a condition where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, has become a recurring event, leading to reef degradation and, in some cases, death. Moreover, human activities such as overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and coastal development contribute to the decline of these delicate ecosystems. Understanding and preserving coral reefs is crucial to ensuring their survival and the health of our oceans. As a result, research and conservation efforts are necessary to mitigate the threats and preserve these vital ecosystems for future generations.
D1-1932	"In this paper we present an empirical study of the worldwide maritime transportation network (WMN) in which the nodes are ports and links are container liners connecting the ports. Using the different representation of network topology namely the space $L$ and $P$, we study the statistical properties of WMN including degree distribution, degree correlations, weight distribution, strength distribution, average shortest path length, line length distribution and centrality measures. We find that WMN is a small-world network with power law behavior. Important nodes are identified based on different centrality measures. Through analyzing weighted cluster coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree, we reveal the hierarchy structure and ""rich-club"" phenomenon in the network."
D1-1933	 In the realm of physics, solar cycles, akin to the cell cycle in biology, mark the 11-year periodic change in the number and frequency of sunspots. These cycles are crucial as they influence space weather, affecting communication systems and power grids. Meanwhile, the Earth's climate witnesses significant oscillations known as climatic oscillations of around 50-55 years. These oscillations, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, impact global temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns. The manner in which these oscillations intertwine and affect each other remains an active area of research in climate science. Additionally, the study of solar cycles may offer insights to better understand and predict these climatic oscillations.
D1-1934	We develop a diagrammatic perturbation treatment to calculate the zero-temperature equation of state of the dilute gas mixture of a single spin component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a normal Fermi gas of indistinguishable (single spin) fermion particles. We find that the mean-field description breaks down near the mechanical instability related to the phase separation phenomenon. Our analysis shows that the instability is caused by the competition of the usual short-range and fermion-mediated boson-boson interactions, which result in a boson compressibility that diverges. In the low BEC-density limit, we show that the diagrammatic analysis simplifies, we sum part of the higher order diagrams, and we discuss the effects of other higher-order contributions.
D1-1935	 Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where particles become interconnected and instantaneously affect each other, regardless of distance, intrigues the scientific community. This non-intuitive connection, proven by experiments, challenges the traditional understanding of space and time. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, illustrating the uncertainty principle, further complicates this realm, questioning the state of a particle until it is observed. In quantum cryptography, this unconventional behavior is exploited to create secure communication channels. Yet, the full grasping of quantum mechanics and its potential applications remains challenging, as it defies our everyday experiences and common sense.
D1-1936	The introduction of intermediate states in the dynamics of the voter model modifies the ordering process and restores an effective surface tension. The logarithmic coarsening of the conventional voter model in two dimensions is eliminated in favour of an algebraic decay of the density of interfaces with time, compatible with Model A dynamics at low temperatures. This phenomenon is addressed by deriving Langevin equations for the dynamics of appropriately defined continuous fields. These equations are analyzed using field theoretical arguments and by means of a recently proposed numerical technique for the integration of stochastic equations with multiplicative noise. We find good agreement with lattice simulations of the microscopic model.
D1-1937	 Photosynthesis, a vital process for life on Earth, converts light energy, mainly from sunlight, into chemical energy in the presence of chlorophyll. This energy is used to produce glucose and oxygen, sustaining life forms and the atmosphere. Plants, algae, and some bacteria engage in this process, with sunlight being absorbed in the chloroplasts and carbon dioxide being converted into organic matter and oxygen. This process is crucial to the carbon cycle, biosphere, and the entire ecosystem, as it forms the basis of most food chains. The interplay between photosynthesis, climate, and environmental factors is intricate and complex, influencing the planet's biodiversity, weather patterns, and even the origin of certain ecosystems. Understanding and preserving photosynthesis is essential for maintaining the delicate balance of life on Earth.
D1-1938	The fluid theory of plasmas is extended to include the properties of electron spin. The linear theory of waves in a magnetized plasma is presented, and it is shown that the spin effects causes a change of the magnetic permeability. Furthemore, by changing the direction of the external magnetic field, the magnetic permability may become negative. This leads to instabilities in the long wavelength regimes. If these can be controlled, however, the spin plasma becomes a metamaterial for a broad range of frequencies, i.e. above the ion cyclotron frequency but below the electron cyclotron frequency. The consequences of our results are discussed.
D1-1939	 Atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside in the atomic nucleus, while electrons orbit around this central region. The number of protons in an atom determines its elemental identity, while the number of neutrons can vary, leading to isotopes. The atomic structure influences an element's properties and its role in chemical reactions.For example, hydrogen, with a single proton and often one electron, is the lightest element, while uranium, with 92 protons, is one of the heaviest naturally occurring elements. Understanding atomic structure is crucial for developing technologies, such as nuclear energy and medicine, and for comprehending the formation of stars and the origins of elements in the universe. The study of atoms and their interactions continues to be a vital area of research in the field of physics.
D1-1940	CaF2(111) single crystal surfaces have been irradiated with swift heavy ions under oblique angles resulting in chains of nanosized hillocks. In order to characterize these nanodots with respect to their conductivity we have applied non-contact atomic force microscopy using a magnetic tip. Measurements in UHV as well as under ambient conditions reveal a clearly enhanced electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic tip and the nanodots. The dissipated energy per cycle is comparable to the value found for metals, indicating that the interaction of the ion with the target material leads to the creation of metallic Ca nanodots on the surface.
D1-1941	 In the grand cosmic dance, natural selection unfolds a vibrant symphony. A photon, a weightless harbinger of light, swiftly traverses space, its journey unraveling the intricate tapestry of the universe. Meanwhile, on Earth, the theory of plate tectonics echoes this dance, as moving plates of lithosphere float atop the semi-fluid asthenosphere, sculpting continents over time.Fast-forward to our own, astonishing realm. Life, whether microscopic or complex, adapts through natural selection, much like a coral reef evolving resilience to changing ocean conditions. This process is not unlike the intricate dance of chemical reactions in stoichiometry, where reactants transform into products to yield a desired outcome.However, our actions, akin to improvisations in this cosmic ballet, can disrupt this delicate dance. Overconsumption, whether of eggs or alcohol, creates unpredictable rhythms, with potential consequences for our health and our planet's health, from elevated cholesterol levels to the onset of global pandemics.Amidst all this, the question of how life first sprang forth on Earth remains a captivating enigma. As we dance through the unknowns, the rhythm of natural selection carries us forward, inviting us to adapt, grow, and co-create this cosmic dance with wisdom and grace.
D1-1942	We determine the Lorentz transformations and the kinematic content and dynamical framework of special relativity as purely an extension of Galileo's thoughts. No reference to light is ever required: The theories of relativity are logically independent of any properties of light. The thoughts of Galileo are fully realized in a system of Lorentz transformations with a parameter 1/c^2, some undetermined, universal constant of nature. and are realizable in no other. Isotropy of space plays a deep and pivotal role in all of this, since here three-dimensional space appears at first blush, and persists until the conclusion: Relativity can never correctly be fully developed in just one spatial dimension.
D1-1943	 Earth's lithosphere, the solid outermost layer, is tectonically active, leading to phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This dynamic behavior results from the movement of tectonic plates, vast slabs of the Earth's crust, that float on a semi-fluid mantle. The boundaries between these plates can collide, diverge, or slide past each other, continually reshaping the Earth's surface.This plate movement is responsible for the formation of mountain ranges, the creation and destruction of continents, and the separation of ocean basins. The Earth's lithosphere, in its constant dance, shows us what geological time truly means, allowing us to map the planet's past and predict its future. Understanding this process helps us comprehend the Earth's evolution and better navigate challenges such as earthquakes, volcanic hazards, and the influence of tectonics on climate and life.
D1-1944	We have studied the Steiner tree problem using six-pin soap films in detail. We extend the existing method of experimental realisation of Steiner trees in $n$-terminal problem through soap films to observe new non-minimal Steiner trees. We also produced spanning tree configurations for the first time by our method. Experimentally, by varying the pin diameter, we have achieved these new stable soap film configurations. A new algorithm is presented for creating these Steiner trees theoretically.   Exact lengths of these Steiner tree configurations are calculated using a geometrical method. An exact two-parameter empirical formula is proposed for estimating the lengths of these soap film configurations in six-pin soap film problem.
D1-1945	 Electromagnetic radiation, a fundamental aspect of the universe, spans a vast spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays. Beyond visible light, X-rays provide insights into the hidden structures of atoms, while ultraviolet radiation aids in disinfection and phototherapy. Radio waves, on the other hand, are harnessed for wireless communication and satellite transmissions. The harnessing and understanding of electromagnetic radiation have revolutionized various fields, from medicine to telecommunications, and continue to be a focal point of ongoing scientific research.
D1-1946	Si nanocrystals (Si-NC) in a-SiOx<Er> were created by high temperature annealing. Si-NC samples have large emission in a broadband region, 700nm to 1000nm. Annealing temperature, annealing time, substrate type, and erbium concentration is studied to allow emission at 1550 nm forsamples with erbium. Emission in the C-Band region is largely reduced by the presence of Si-NC. This reduction may be due to less efficient energy transfer processes from the nanocrystals than from the amorphous matrix to the Er3+ ions, perhaps due to the formation of more centro-symmetric Er3+ sites at the nanocrystal surfaces or to very different optimal erbium concentrations between amorphous and crystallized samples.
D1-1947	 In the realm of physics, reaction rates within chemical processes are a crucial aspect of understanding chemical reactions. They determine the speed at which a chemical transformation occurs under specific conditions. Factors such as temperature, concentration, and catalyst presence can significantly influence reaction rates. For instance, an increase in temperature generally leads to an acceleration of reaction rates due to the enhanced kinetic energy of reactant particles.In contrast, a decrease in concentration may slow down the reaction rate, as there are fewer collisions between reactant particles. Furthermore, the addition of a catalyst can drastically reduce the activation energy, making it easier for reactant particles to collide and react, thus increasing the reaction rate.This understanding of reaction rates is essential in various fields, such as industries that produce chemicals, medicines, or fuels, and in environmental sciences for understanding pollution rates or natural processes like photosynthesis. Maintaining control over reaction rates is crucial for optimizing industrial processes, ensuring safe and effective medicine production, and preserving delicate ecosystems.
D1-1948	We present two models of continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence which are representable as nonnegative discrete dynamical systems, namely the Hegselmann-Krause model (Hegselmann and Krause, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 5(3), 2002) and the Deffuant-Weisbuch model (Deffuant et al, Advances in Complex Systems, 3, 2000). We fully characterize the set of fixed points for both models. They are identical. Further on, we present reformulations of both models on the more general level of densities of agents in the opinion space as interactive Markov chains. We also characterize the sets of fixed points as identical in both models.
D1-1949	 Photons, the massless particles of light, illuminate the universe, yet a simpler light, the cholesterol molecule, stirs debate in nutrition science. Like photons, cholesterol plays a crucial role in our bodies, contributing to cell membrane integrity, hormone production, and vitamin absorption. However, the dietary impact of cholesterol has long been debated, with concerns over high consumption and its potential link to cardiovascular diseases. The scientific community continues to explore the intricacies of cholesterol and its role in our health, much like how astrophysicists study photons to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. The question remains: Is it the light that illuminates or the cholesterol molecule that brings clarity to our understanding of diet and health?
D1-1950	The limit cycle of the van der Pol oscillator, $\ddot{x}+ \epsilon (x^2-1) \dot{x} + x =0$, is studied in the plane $(x,\dot{x})$ by applying the homotopy analysis method. A recursive set of formulas that approximate the amplitude and form of this limit cycle for the whole range of the parameter $\epsilon$ is obtained. These formulas generate the amplitude with an error less than 0.1%. To our knowledge, this is the first time where an analytical approximation of the amplitude of the van der Pol limit cycle, with validity from the weakly up to the strongly nonlinear regime, is given.
D1-1951	 Artificial sweeteners, non-caloric alternatives to sugar, are integral to the modern world, found in a plethora of food and beverage products. Crafted from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, these molecules mimic sugar's sweetness without adding calories. While they offer a solution for managing diets and maintaining dental health, their long-term effects on human physiology are still being studied, with debates surrounding potential links to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. For now, their widespread use underscores the human quest for sugar substitutes that allow for culinary indulgence without the metabolic consequences.
D1-1952	We study the effect of advection and small diffusion on passive tracers. The advecting velocity field is assumed to have mean zero and to possess time-periodic stream lines. Using a canonical transform to action-angle variables followed by a Lie-transform, we derive an averaged equation describing the effective motion of the tracers. An estimate for the time validity of the first-order approximation is established. For particular cases of a regularized vortical flow we present explicit formulas for the coefficients of the averaged equation both at first and at second order. Numerical simulations indicate that the validity of the above first-order estimate extends to the second order.
D1-1953	 Photons, fundamental particles of light, traverse the universe with no mass, shaping the cosmos as we know it. Meanwhile, the enigma of life's origin remains unsolved, with abiogenesis, the theory suggesting life originated from simple organic compounds, continuing to be the leading hypothesis.In our planet's earliest days, primitive chemistry might have given rise to the first building blocks of life, setting in motion a series of events that would shape the evolution of the species. Fast forward billions of years, and the intricate dance of life is played out on Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems, such as coral reefs, teeming with an astonishing array of organisms.As we continue to explore the mysteries of our existence, the tantalizing question of life beyond Earth also captivates the scientific community. Of course, back on our home planet, the debate about how many eggs to eat per day persists, a reminder that life is not all about exploring the cosmos, but also about the choices we make in our daily lives.
D1-1954	We stabilize an ultraviolet diode laser system at 369.5 nm to the optical absorption signal from Yb+ ions in a hollow-cathode discharge lamp. The error signal for stabilization is obtained by Zeeman spectroscopy of the 3 GHz-wide absorption feature. The frequency stability is independently measured by comparison against the fluorescence signal from a laser-cooled crystal of 174Yb+ ions in a linear Paul trap. We measure a frequency fluctuation of 1.7 MHz RMS over 1000 s, and a frequency drift of 20 MHz over 7 days. Our method is suitable for use in quantum information processing experiments with trapped ion crystals.
D1-1955	 The COVID-19 pandemic, a global health crisis, emerged in late 2019, originating from zoonotic transmission between animals and humans. The etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel coronavirus, which shares similarities with certain bat coronaviruses, suggesting potential bat-to-human spillover as the primary origin. However, the precise intermediate host remains a topic of ongoing research. The virus's rapid spread and its ability to cause severe respiratory illness have underscored the importance of epidemiology, public health, and global collaboration in containing pandemics. Vaccine development, virus monitoring, and understanding the virus's mutations are critical in our ongoing fight against COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.
D1-1956	The elastic scattering amplitudes of indistinguishable, bosonic, strongly-polar molecules possess universal properties at the coldest temperatures due to wave propagation in the long-range dipole-dipole field. Universal scattering cross sections and anisotropic threshold angular distributions, independent of molecular species, result from careful tuning of the dipole moment with an applied electric field. Three distinct families of threshold resonances also occur for specific field strengths, and can be both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted using elementary adiabatic and semi-classical techniques. The temperatures and densities of heteronuclear molecular gases required to observe these univeral characteristics are predicted. PACS numbers: 34.50.Cx, 31.15.ap, 33.15.-e, 34.20.-b
D1-1957	 Thermodynamics, a fundamental principle in physics, governs the behavior of energy and its transformation. It illustrates that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. This law, known as the first law of thermodynamics, is pertinent in numerous natural and man-made systems. For instance, the transformation of heat into mechanical work, as in steam engines or solar panels, or the conversion of chemical energy into heat, as in combustion processes, are all governed by these principles. The second law, meanwhile, highlights the inevitability of entropy increase, or disorder, during any energy transformation. This dictates the efficiency limits of various systems, such as heat engines or refrigerators. The connection between thermodynamics and our daily lives is profound, as it helps us understand the functioning of our world and shapes many technologies we rely on.
D1-1958	Interference is one of the most fundamental features which characterizes quantum systems. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis of the interfere dynamics associated with wave-packet superpositions from both the standard quantum-mechanical perspective and the Bohmian one.   From this analysis, clear and insightful pictures of the physics involved in this kind of processes are obtained, which are of general validity (i.e., regardless of the type of wave packets considered) in the understanding of more complex cases where interference is crucial (e.g., scattering problems, slit diffraction, quantum control scenarios or, even, multipartite interactions). In particular, we show how problems involving wave-packet interference can be mapped onto problems of wave packets scattered off potential barriers.
D1-1959	 Protein synthesis is a crucial biochemical process that constructs proteins, vital components in a cell, from amino acid building blocks. This process consists of three phases: transcription, where DNA is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA), translation, where the mRNA sequence provides instructions to assemble an amino acid chain, and finally, folding, where the newly formed protein assumes its functional shape. Each protein plays a distinctive role in numerous cellular functions, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to forming cellular structures, making protein synthesis fundamental to life. While the specifics of this process vary across organisms, it's a fundamental process conserved across all life forms.
D1-1960	We present a new algorithm for vibrational control in deuterium molecules that is feasible with current experimental technology. A pump mechanism is used to create a coherent superposition of the D2+ vibrations. A short, intense infrared control pulse is applied after a chosen delay time to create selective interferences. A `chessboard' pattern of states can be realized in which a set of even- or odd-numbered vibrational states can be selectively annihilated or enhanced. A technique is proposed for experimental realization and observation of this effect using 5 fs pulses of 790 nm radiation, with intermediate intensity (5e13 W/cm2)
D1-1961	 Photons, the massless particles of light, fuel the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose (a simple carbohydrate) and oxygen. This essential biochemical reaction, powered by solar energy, is the basis of life on Earth. Carbohydrate breakdown, or catabolism, releases energy stored in glucose molecules, providing fuel for cellular functions. This energy release happens in a series of steps, first through glycolysis, then the citric acid cycle, and finally oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately converting chemical energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This ATP serves as the universal energy currency within cells, powering various processes that sustain life, from muscle contractions to neural signaling. The interplay between photosynthesis, carbohydrate breakdown, and ATP production forms the energy-rich cycle that sustains life on our planet.
D1-1962	TeV scale lepton-hadron and photon-hadron colliders are necessary both to clarify fundamental aspects of strong interactions and for adequate interpretation of the LHC data. Today, there are two realistic proposals for the post-HERA era, namely, QCD Explorer (QCD-E) and Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC). Both QCD-E and LHeC can operate as eA colliders, whereas gamma-p and gamma-A options are unique for QCD-E. Another advantage of QCD-E is the possibility to increase the center of mass energy by lengthening of electron linac. In this presentation main parameters of the QCD-E nucleus options are discussed.
D1-1963	 Viral evolution is a continuous process, shaping the emergence and transmission of diseases. Viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, are simple entities that replicate rapidly, causing rapid evolution through mutation. These mutations can lead to new virus strains, sometimes altering transmissibility, severity, or immunity responses.For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a zoonotic spillover event, where the virus was likely transmitted from an animal host to humans. Since then, various SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some with increased transmissibility or immune escape properties.Understanding viral evolution is crucial to predicting and mitigating the impact of future pandemics. By monitoring the emergence and spread of new variants, public health officials can develop targeted interventions, vaccines, and treatment strategies to combat the global health threat posed by these dynamic entities.
D1-1964	In this manuscript, we analytically and numerically study statistical properties of an heteroskedastic process based on the celebrated ARCH generator of random variables whose variance is defined by a memory of $q_{m}$-exponencial, form ($e_{q_{m}=1}^{x}=e^{x}$). Specifically, we inspect the self-correlation function of squared random variables as well as the kurtosis. In addition, by numerical procedures, we infer the stationary probability density function of both of the heteroskedastic random variables and the variance, the multiscaling properties, the first-passage times distribution, and the dependence degree. Finally, we introduce an asymmetric variance version of the model that enables us to reproduce the so-called leverage effect in financial markets.
D1-1965	 In the realm of physics, the concept of relativity, as elucidated by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space and time. Relativity theory, comprising special and general relativity, posits that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, regardless of the observer's motion or the light source's motion.General relativity, in particular, provides a comprehensive explanation for the gravitational effects observed in the universe. It proposes that gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. This curved fabric of space-time determines the motion of objects, including planets orbiting stars and galaxies moving through the cosmos.Moreover, general relativity predicts phenomena such as gravitational waves, ripples in space-time caused by accelerating masses, and time dilation, the slowing of time relative to an observer in a stronger gravitational field. These phenomena have been confirmed through observational evidence, further strengthening the theory's validity.The impact of relativity on our understanding of the universe continues to be profound, shaping our perspectives on everything from the Big Bang to black holes, and driving ongoing research in physics and astronomy.
D1-1966	We report the observation of above-threshold dissociation of a multielectron molecular system, Na$_2^+$. The process is due to continuum-continuum transitions in a field-dressed molecular continuum. Three well resolved fragmentation channels with different kinetic energy release patterns have been detected, of which, two are associated with ordinary photodissociation via light-induced potentials into Na(3s) + Na$^+$ and Na(3p) + Na$^+$, and one with continuum-continuum transitions and above-threshold dissociation into Na(3p) + Na$^+$. We show that when we dress this molecule with a field whose intensity is ~3 x 10$^{12}$ W/cm$^2$, above-threshold dissociation prevails over other processes, such as field-ionization followed by Coulomb explosion.
D1-1967	 Marine bioluminescence, a captivating natural phenomenon, is the emission of light by marine organisms, such as jellyfish, squids, and certain types of bacteria. This illumination is often triggered by physical disturbance or chemical reactions within the organism. Bioluminescence serves multiple purposes, including communication, camouflage, luring prey, and defense mechanisms. Harnessing this light-producing ability has led to numerous scientific advancements, including the development of bioluminescent markers for research and medical diagnoses. However, our understanding of this radiant underwater world remains limited, sparking further curiosity and research in marine biology.
D1-1968	Cells swimming in confined environments are attracted by surfaces. We measure the steady-state distribution of smooth-swimming bacteria (Escherichia coli) between two glass plates. In agreement with earlier studies, we find a strong increase of the cell concentration at the boundaries. We demonstrate theoretically that hydrodynamic interactions of the swimming cells with solid surfaces lead to their re-orientation in the direction parallel to the surfaces, as well as their attraction by the closest wall. A model is derived for the steady-state distribution of swimming cells, which compares favorably with our measurements. We exploit our data to estimate the flagellar propulsive force in swimming E. coli.
D1-1969	 Pharmaceutical research continually strives to advance, with drug development being a significant focus. Fostered by scientific breakthroughs, modern drug discoveries encompass a vast array of molecules. For instance, monoclonal antibodies are protein-based therapies, designed to mimic the immune system's defense mechanisms, providing targeted treatment for various illnesses. Similarly, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary genetic engineering tool, allows for precise editing of a cell's DNA, potentially fixing genetic mutations and halting disease progression.Continuous innovation in drug development is crucial for addressing ongoing health challenges, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. By harnessing the power of advanced scientific methodologies, we can work towards a future where effective treatments and vaccines are readily available for public health crises. In alignment with this, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of diseases will help facilitate the creation of more targeted and personalized therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of medicine.
D1-1970	The impact of a drop onto a liquid layer and the subsequent splash has important implications for diverse physical processes such as air-sea gas transfer, cooling, and combustion. In the {\it crown splash} parameter regime, the splash pattern is highly regular. We focus on this case as a model for the mechanism that leads to secondary droplets, and thus explain the drop size distribution resulting from the splash. We show that the mean number of secondary droplets is determined by the most unstable wavelength of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Variations from this mean are governed by the width of the spectrum. Our results for the crown splash will provide the basis for understanding more complicated splashes.
D1-1971	 Harnessing the power of the sun has long been a focus in the realm of physics. Solar energy, a renewable and clean source, presents a promising solution to our growing energy demands and environmental concerns. Photovoltaic cells, the cornerstone of solar technology, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are made primarily of silicon, a semiconductor material, which absorbs photons from sunlight, releasing electrons that generate an electric current. The efficiency of these cells, however, remains a significant challenge, with ongoing research aimed at improving their performance and reducing their cost. The future of solar energy holds promise as advancements in materials science, nanotechnology, and manufacturing techniques could lead to more efficient, affordable, and accessible solar energy solutions, ultimately paving the way for a sustainable and solar-powered future.
D1-1972	We present experimental results on turbulence generated in thin fluid layers in the presence of a large-scale coherent flow, or a spectral condensate. It is shown that the condensate modifies the third-order velocity moment in a much wider interval of scales than the second one. The modification may include the change of sign of the third moment in the inverse cascade. This observation may help resolve a controversy on the energy flux in mesoscale atmospheric turbulence (10-500 km): to recover a correct energy flux from the third velocity moment one needs first to subtract the coherent flow. We find that the condensate also increases the velocity flatness.
D1-1973	 In the realm of quantum physics, the wave-particle duality stands as a testament to nature's enigmatic essence. This principle underscores the inherent ability of particles, such as photons and electrons, to exhibit properties of both waves and particles, thus blurring the traditional boundaries of classical physics. This duality, as demonstrated through experiments like the double-slit experiment, challenges our understanding of reality, suggesting that observation itself can alter the behavior of subatomic particles. This profound concept, though initially perplexing, has opened doors to a deeper, more intricate understanding of the universe and the fundamental forces governing it.
D1-1974	In forced polymer translocation, the average translocation time, $\tau$, scales with respect to pore force, $f$, and polymer length, $N$, as $\tau \sim f^{-1} N^{\beta}$. We demonstrate that an artifact in Metropolis Monte Carlo method resulting in breakage of the force scaling with large $f$ may be responsible for some of the controversies between different computationally obtained results and also between computational and experimental results. Using Langevin dynamics simulations we show that the scaling exponent $\beta \le 1 + \nu$ is not universal, but depends on $f$. Moreover, we show that forced translocation can be described by a relatively simple force balance argument and $\beta$ to arise solely from the initial polymer configuration.
D1-1975	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition postulates that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude. This principle is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed. The act of measurement collapses the superposition into one definite state. This counterintuitive phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of reality, suggesting that the universe is fundamentally probabilistic at its core. Furthermore, the theory of entanglement, a strong correlation between two or more particles regardless of distance, adds another layer of intrigue, defying locality and blurring the line between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.
D1-1976	We propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a coherent microwave photonic receiver operating at 35 GHz carrier frequency. The device is based on a lithium niobate or lithium tantalate optical whispering gallery mode resonator coupled to a microwave strip line resonator. Microwave local oscillator is fed into the microwave resonator along with the microwave signal. We show that the sensitivity of this receiver significantly exceeds the sensitivity of the incoherent quadratic receiver based on the same technology. The coherent receiver can possess a dynamic range in excess of 100 dB in 5 MHz band if a low noise laser is utilized.
D1-1977	 In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle posits an intrinsic limitation in simultaneously measuring the position and momentum of a particle. The product of the uncertainties in position and momentum, Δx Δp, is bound by Planck's constant, h, such that Δx Δp ≥ h/4π. This principle challenges classical notions of determinism and locality, suggesting that the universe operates in a probabilistic, wave-like manner at its fundamental level. Moreover, it implies that particles can exhibit wave-particle duality, exhibiting properties of both waves and particles, depending on how they are observed. This principle has profound implications for our understanding of the very nature of reality.
D1-1978	We measure the photoionization cross-section of vibrationally excited levels in the S2 state of azulene by femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. At the wavelengths studied (349-265 nm in the pump) the transient signals exhibit two distinct and well-defined behaviours: (i) Short-term (on the order of a picosecond) polarization dependent transients and (ii) longer (10 ps - 1 ns) time-scale decays. This letter focuses on the short time transient. In contrast to an earlier study by Diau et al.22 [J. Chem. Phys. 110 (1999) 9785.] we unambiguously assign the fast initial decay signal to rotational dephasing of the initial alignment created by the pump transition.
D1-1979	 Harnessing the power of the sun has always been a captivating pursuit in modern physics. Solar energy, a renewable and abundant resource, is transforming our energy landscape. Photovoltaic cells, the cornerstone of solar technology, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells, typically made of silicon, have been significantly improving efficiency over the years, now reaching around 25%. However, the quest for even higher efficiency continues, with research focusing on materials like perovskites and organic photovoltaics. By optimizing these technologies, we can further reduce carbon emissions and pave the way for a sustainable energy future.
D1-1980	Using first-principles density functional calculations, we have studied the structural stability of stoichiometric as well as non-stoichiometric CdS nanoclusters at ambient pressure with diameters ranging up to about 2.5 nm. Our study reveals that the relative stability of the two available structures for CdS, namely zinc blende and wurtzite, depends sensitively on the details like surface geometry and/or surface chemistry. The associated band gap also exhibits non-monotonic behavior as a function of cluster size. Our findings may shed light on reports of experimentally observed structures and associated electronic structures of CdS nanoclusters found in the literature.
D1-1981	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental pillar, elegantly describes the time evolution of a quantum system's wave function. This differential equation, derived from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, encapsulates the probabilistic nature of quantum particles, painting a vivid picture of the superposition state. In this state, a quantum particle exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed, a phenomenon known as quantum superposition, which challenges our classical understanding of reality. The Schrödinger equation, with its intricate balance of energy, time, and probability, continues to captivate and challenge physicists, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the enigmatic world of quantum physics.
D1-1982	We introduce a novel class of spatial complex variable function Gaussian (CVF-Gaussian) beam, which is the product of an arbitrary analytic complex variable function and a Gaussian function, in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media (SNNM). The CVF-Gaussian beam rotates generally during propagation. By choosing the input power of the beam, we can obtain the CVF-Gaussian breather or the CVF-Gaussian soliton. We reveal that stable CVF-Gaussian beam can exist in SNNM with different forms, including rotating dipole, and rotating elliptic donut. A distribution factor which is the parameter for the description of the transverse distribution of the CVF-Gaussian beam is discussed.
D1-1983	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, provided it's isolated. This is vividly demonstrated in the double-slit experiment, where particles behave as both particles and waves, creating an interference pattern only when they are not observed. This counterintuitive phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of reality and underscores the fundamentally different nature of the quantum world. The implications stretch beyond the microscopic realm, hinting at the potential for quantum computers to revolutionize information processing and encryption.
D1-1984	"A series of phenomena pertaining to economics, quantum physics, language, literary criticism, and especially architecture is studied from the standpoint of synergetics (the study of self-organizing complex systems). It turns out that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a ""quantized"" from of the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to the""blending in"" of new architectural structures in an existing environment."
D1-1985	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition fascinates scientists. It posits that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon eluding classical physics. For instance, an electron can be in two places at once, a paradox in macroscopic terms. This superposition collapses when observed, an event known as the wave function collapse. The intricate dance of particles in this state, governed by the Schrödinger equation, challenges our understanding of reality and presents a mesmerizing exploration into the microscopic world.
D1-1986	The search of the correct equation of motion for a classical charged particle under the action of its electromagnetic (EM) self-field, the so-called \textit{radiation-reaction equation of motion}, remains elusive to date. In this paper we intend to point out why this is so. The discussion is based on the direct construction of the EM self-potentials produced by a charged spherical particle under the action of an external EM force. In particular we intend to analyze basic features of the LAD (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac) and the LL (Landau-Lifschitz) equations. Both are shown to lead to incorrect or incomplete results.
D1-1987	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar energy is a renewable resource with immense potential. Utilizing photovoltaic cells, solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, providing a clean and sustainable source of power. Solar energy eliminates the reliance on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. Despite initial costs, the long-term benefits are significant, including lower energy bills, increased energy independence, and a reduced carbon footprint. With advancements in technology, solar energy is becoming increasingly efficient, making it a viable solution for meeting global energy demands. Embracing solar energy is not just an environmentally conscious choice, but a step towards a future powered by the endless energy of the sun.
D1-1988	"We present angular distributions of photoelectrons of atomic model systems excited by intense linearly polarized laser pulses in the VUV- and XUV-regime. We solve the multi-dimensional time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for one particle on large spatial grids and investigate the direction dependence of the ionized electrons for isotropic s-states as well as p-states. Although the ponderomotive potential is small compared to the binding energy of the initially bound electron and the photon energy of the exciting laser field, richly structured photoelectron angular distributions are found which sensitively depend on the laser frequency and intensity as well as on the number of absorbed photons. The occuring shapes are explained in terms of scattering mechanisms."
D1-1989	 Delving into quantum mechanics, we find the intriguing concept of superposition. It posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a specific probability, until an observation is made. This phenomenon, counterintuitive to our daily experiences, challenges our classical understanding of reality. Superposition is crucial in explaining quantum phenomena such as interference and entanglement, where particles become instantaneously linked regardless of distance. The implications of this theory stretch beyond physics, potentially influencing our understanding of computing, cryptography, and even the fundamental nature of reality itself.
D1-1990	We present numerical simulations of circular Couette flow in axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional geometry of a cylindrical annulus inspired by Princeton MRI liquid gallium experiment. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved with the spectral element code Nek5000 incorporating realistic horizontal boundary conditions of differentially rotating rings. We investigate the effect of changing rotation rates (Reynolds number) and of the horizontal boundary conditions on flow structure, Ekman circulation and associated transport of angular momentum through the onset of unsteadiness and three-dimensionality. A mechanism for the explanation of the dependence of the Ekman flows and circulation on horizontal boundary conditions is proposed.
D1-1991	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, particles don't strictly follow the deterministic paths we observe in classical physics. Instead, they exhibit a probabilistic behavior, a concept encapsulated in the wave function. This wave function, a mathematical description of a quantum state, provides the probability of finding a particle at a specific point in space at a given time. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this, showing that particles can behave both as particles and waves, and their behavior is influenced by observation. This dual nature, coupled with the ability of entangled particles to share instantaneous information regardless of distance, challenges our intuitive understanding and redefines our perception of reality in the microscopic world.
D1-1992	The resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations as usually defined in the quasineutral approximation refer to a system of 14 scalar equations in 14 scalar variables, hence are determined to be complete and soluble. These equations are a combination of Navier-Stokes and a subset of Maxwell's. However, one of the vector equations is actually an identity when viewed from the potential formulation of electrodynamics, hence does not determine any degrees of freedom. Only by reinstating Gauss's law does the system of equations become closed, allowing for the determination of both the current and mass flow velocity from the equations of motion. Results of a typical analysis of the proposed electromagnetic hydrodynamic model including the magnetization force are presented.
D1-1993	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental pillar, dictates the time evolution of a quantum system. It's a partial differential equation that describes the wave function, a probability amplitude, of a system. This wave function provides the probabilities for the possible outcomes of measurements, encapsulating the inherent uncertainty in the quantum world. The equation is named after Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, who, in 1935, proposed the thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat, a paradoxical illustration of quantum superposition and the apparent contradiction of reality with probabilities. Yet, the Schrödinger equation's solutions have played a pivotal role in the development of quantum mechanics, shedding light on the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.
D1-1994	Variations in the electrostatic surface potential between the proof mass and electrode housing in the space-based gravitational wave mission LISA is one of the largest contributors of noise at frequencies below a few mHz. Torsion balances provide an ideal testbed for investigating these effects in conditions emulative of LISA. Our apparatus consists of a Au coated Cu plate brought near a Au coated Si plate pendulum suspended from a thin W wire. We have measured a white noise level of $30, \uVhz$ above approximately 0.1, mHz, rising at lower frequencies, for the surface potential variations between these two closely spaced metals.
D1-1995	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates a fascinating trade-off between position and momentum. This principle asserts that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This inherent uncertainty is not a limitation of our measuring instruments, but a fundamental aspect of the nature of particles at the quantum level. This principle, along with quantum superposition and entanglement, challenges our classical understanding of the physical world and remains a cornerstone of quantum theory.
D1-1996	We observe high-resolution diffraction patterns of a thermal-energy helium-atom beam reflected from a microstructured surface grating at grazing incidence. The grating consists of 10-$\mu$m-wide Cr strips patterned on a quartz substrate and has a periodicity of 20 $\mu$m. Fully-resolved diffraction peaks up to the $7^{\rm th}$ order are observed at grazing angles up to 20 mrad. With changes in de Broglie wavelength or grazing angle the relative diffraction intensities show significant variations which shed light on the nature of the atom-surface interaction potential. The observations are explained in terms of quantum reflection at the long-range attractive Casimir-van der Waals potential.
D1-1997	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition represents a fascinating anomaly. A quantum particle, such as an electron, exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. This superposition collapses when measured, revealing only one state. This counterintuitive behavior challenges our classical understanding of reality, suggesting that the act of observation shapes the outcome. The enigma of quantum superposition continues to intrigue physicists, potentially offering insights into the very fabric of the universe.
D1-1998	"The two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is used to describe the propagation of an intense laser beam through a medium with Kerr nonlinearity. The coupled two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations are used to describe interaction of electromagnetic waves with different polarizations in nonlinear optics. In this paper, we solve the above equations by imposing a quadratic condition on the related argument functions and using their symmetry transformations. More complete families of exact solutions of such type are obtained. Many known interesting solutions, such soliton ones, turn out to be special cases of our solutions."
D1-1999	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement, a fascinating phenomenon, links particles in such a way that the state of one instantaneously influences the other, regardless of the distance between them. This spooky action-at-a-distance challenges our classical understanding of causality and locality. Quantum entanglement is central to quantum computing, where it enables faster processing through quantum superposition and interference. The potential for quantum computers to revolutionize encryption, optimization, and simulation in various fields, from medicine to finance, is immense, making the study of entanglement not only a scientific curiosity but a practical necessity.
D1-2000	A common goal in an experimental physics analysis is to extract information from a reaction with multi-dimensional kinematics. The preferred method for such a task is typically the unbinned maximum likelihood method. In fits using this method, the likelihood is a goodness-of-fit quantity in that it effectively discriminates between available hypotheses. however, it does not provide any information as to how well the best hypothesis describes the data.   In this paper, we present an {\em ad-hoc} procedure for obtaining chi**2/n.d.f. values from unbinned maximum likelihood fits. This method does not require binning the data, making it very applicable to multi-dimensional problems.
D1-2001	 In the realm of quantum physics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental pillar, describes the time evolution of a quantum system's wave function. This equation, derived by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, encapsulates the interplay between energy, time, and wave mechanics. It's a differential equation, a mathematical tool that models changing quantities, in this case, the probability distribution of a quantum particle. The solution of the Schrödinger equation provides the wave function, which, when squared, gives the particle's probability density at any given point in space and time. This intricate dance of waves and particles, governed by the Schrödinger equation, continues to unravel the mysterious world beneath our macroscopic realm.
D1-2002	The behavior of small samples in very short and intense hard x-ray pulses is studied by molecular dynamics type calculations. The main emphasis is put on the effect of various tamper layers about the sample. This is discussed from the point of view of structural imaging of single particles, including not only the distortion of the structure but also the background conditions. A detailed picture is given about the Coulomb explosion, with explanation of the tampering mechanism. It is shown that a thin water layer is efficient in slowing down the distortion of the atomic structure, but it gives a significant contribution to the background.
D1-2003	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. This clean, renewable energy source mitigates our dependence on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, efficiency remains a challenge. current silicon-based PV cells have a maximum conversion rate of around 25%. Researchers are exploring alternative materials and structures, such as perovskites and tandem cells, to boost efficiency and lower costs, aiming for a future where solar power becomes a dominant player in global energy production.
D1-2004	We analyze a systematic algorithm for the exact computation of the current cumulants in stochastic nonequilibrium systems, recently discussed in the framework of full counting statistics for mesoscopic systems. This method is based on identifying the current cumulants from a Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation expansion for the generating function. Here it is derived from a simple path-distribution identity and extended to the joint statistics of multiple currents. For a possible thermodynamical interpretation, we compare this approach to a generalized Onsager-Machlup formalism. We present calculations for a boundary driven Kawasaki dynamics on a one-dimensional chain, both for attractive and repulsive particle interactions.
D1-2005	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, dictates an intriguing dance between particles and observation. This principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot both be precisely measured at the same time. The more accurately we know a particle's position, the less accurately we can know its momentum, and vice versa. This fundamental concept challenges our classical understanding of the world, suggesting a fundamental indeterminacy in nature that underpins the very fabric of our physical reality.
D1-2006	The complex theoretical and experimental investigation of plasma kinetics of the electric discharge in the mixture of air and ethanol-water vapors is carried out. The discharge was burning in the cavity, formed by air jets pumping between electrodes, placed in aqueous ethanol solution. It is found out that the hydrogen yield from the discharge is maximal in the case when ethanol and water in the solution are in equal amounts. It is shown that the hydrogen production increases with the discharge power and reaches the saturation at high value. The concentrations of the main stable gas-phase components, measured experimentally and calculated numerically, agree well in the most cases.
D1-2007	 In the realm of quantum physics, the phenomenon of superposition invites intrigue. A fundamental concept, it postulates that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated probability. This is distinct from classical physics, where an object occupies one state at a time. Superposition is beautifully illustrated in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box could theoretically be both alive and dead at the same time, depending on the quantum state of a radioactive atom. As bewildering as it sounds, this principle underpins the functioning of quantum computers, where qubits can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, enabling them to process an enormous number of possibilities concurrently.
D1-2008	The properties of a special class of correlated many-body wave functions, named rotating vortex clusters (RVCs), that preserve the total angular momentum of a small cloud of trapped rotating bosons are investigated. They have lower energy and provide a superior description for the formation of vortices compared to the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) states that break the rotational symmetry. The GP vortex states are shown to be wave packets composed of such RVC states. Our results suggest that, for a small number of bosons, the physics is different from that of ideal Bose-Einstein condensates which characterize larger assemblies
D1-2009	 Harnessing the power of the sun through solar energy is a significant stride in modern physics. Photovoltaic cells, primarily composed of silicon, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are interconnected to form solar panels, which are increasingly being integrated into residential and commercial rooftops, and large-scale solar farms. The potential for solar energy is vast, with the sun providing enough energy to meet global energy demands for over a hundred thousand years. As we continue to innovate and optimize solar technology, the future of sustainable and renewable energy looks promising, promising a world powered by the endless, clean energy of the sun.
D1-2010	The Green Nagdhi equations are frequently used as a model of the wave-like behaviour of the free surface of a fluid, or the interface between two homogeneous fluids of differing densities. Here we show that their multilayer extension arises naturally from a framework based on the Euler Poincare theory under an ansatz of columnar motion. The framework also extends to the travelling wave solutions of the equations. We present numerical solutions of the travelling wave problem in a number of flow regimes. We find that the free surface and multilayer waves can exhibit intriguing differences compared to the results of single layer or rigid lid models.
D1-2011	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates an intriguing dichotomy: the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle, a cornerstone of quantum theory, challenges classical notions of certainty and predictability, revealing a world where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. It paints a picture of a cosmos inherently uncertain, where the act of measurement itself alters the very nature of the observed. This profound concept, once considered as a limitation, now serves as a foundation for quantum computing, where particles' superposition and entanglement generate immense computational power.
D1-2012	Excitable membranes are an important type of nonlinear dynamical system and their study can be used to provide a connection between physical and biological circuits. We discuss two models of excitable membranes important in cardiac and neural tissues. One model is based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations and the other is based on a three-transistor excitable circuit. We construct a circuit that simulates reentrant tachycardia and its treatment by surgical ablation. This project is appropriate for advanced undergraduates as a laboratory capstone project, or as a senior thesis or honors project, and can also be a collaborative project, with one student responsible for the computational predictions and another for the circuit construction and measurements.
D1-2013	 Harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, scientists are exploring the realm of quantum computing. This cutting-edge technology, based on manipulating quantum bits or qubits, has the potential to revolutionize computing by performing multiple calculations simultaneously. Unlike classical computers that rely on binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum superposition, allowing qubits to exist in multiple states at once. This enables quantum computers to solve complex problems much faster than traditional machines. However, the practical implementation of this technology remains a significant challenge due to the delicate nature of qubits and the need for error-free operation in a stable quantum environment. Nevertheless, the promise of quantum computing, with its potential to solve problems in fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence, continues to drive researchers to overcome these obstacles.
D1-2014	The characteristic properties of two-phase Ar avalanche detectors, including those obtained with CsI photocathode, are further studied. Such detectors are relevant in the field of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. The detectors investigated comprised a 1 cm thick liquid Ar layer followed by a triple-GEM multiplier. In these detectors, typical gains reaching 10000 were obtained with good reproducibility and a stable operation for at least one day was demonstrated. Amplitude and pulse-shape characteristics are presented under irradiation with X-rays, gamma-rays and neutrons from different radioactive sources. The detection of both primary scintillation and ionization signals at higher gains, at a deposited energy of 60 keV, has been demonstrated.
D1-2015	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment challenges our perception of reality. A cat, in a sealed box, is linked to a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, a hammer breaks a vial of poison, killing the cat. According to quantum superposition, the cat exists in all possible states simultaneously – dead and alive – until the box is opened and an observer collapses the wave function, revealing the cat's fate. This paradoxical scenario questions the nature of reality, the role of observation, and the very fabric of the universe itself.
D1-2016	Radiometric data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts have revealed an unexplained constant acceleration of a_A = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^(-10) m s^(-2) towards the Sun, also known as the Pioneer anomaly. Different groups have analyzed the Pioneer data and have got the same results, which rules out computer programming and handling errors. Attempts to explain this phenomenon arguing intrinsic causes on-board the spacecrafts failed or have lead to inconclusive results. Therefore, the Pioneer anomalous acceleration has motivated the interest of researchers to find out explanations that could bring insight upon the forces acting in the outer Solar Systems or a hint to discover new natural laws.
D1-2017	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a fundamental theory, postulates an intrinsic limit to the precision with which the position and momentum of a particle can be simultaneously known. This principle, famously encapsulated by the equation Δx Δp ≥ h/4π, underscores the unavoidable trade-off between observing a particle's position and its momentum. This principle, though initially puzzling, has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the microscopic world, challenging classical notions of certainty and predictability.
D1-2018	Factors that contribute to the temperature dependence of a resonant frequency in a low-expansion optical cavity are discussed, including deformation at the cavity ends due to different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the spacer, optically-contacted mirror substrate and coating. A model of the temperature dependence is presented that incorporates finite-element-analysis of the cavity ends. A measurement of frequency versus temperature of a cavity mode is used along with the model to deduce a spacers CTE versus temperature profile. The measured profile correlates very well with a separate experiment utilizing a temporary surface-mounted Fabry-Perot cavity fabricated on the outside of the spacer with hydroxy-catalysis bonding.
D1-2019	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental cornerstone, encapsulates the dynamics of a quantum system. Named after Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, this equation is a partial differential equation that governs the wave function, a function representing the probability amplitude of a quantum state. Solving this equation provides the time evolution of any quantum state, including energy levels and wave functions for various systems. Crucially, the square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density of finding a particle at a given location, exemplifying the inherent uncertainty and wave-particle duality at the heart of quantum mechanics.
D1-2020	Exciton effects are studied in single-wall boron-nitride nanotubes. The Coulomb interaction dependence of the band gap, the optical gap, and the binding energy of excitons are discussed. The optical gap of the (5,0) nanotube is about 6eV at the onsite interaction U=2t with the hopping integral t=1.1eV. The binding energy of the exciton is 0.50eV for these parameters. This energy agrees well with that of other theoretical investigations. We find that the energy gap and the binding energy are almost independent of the geometries of nanotubes. This novel property is in contrast with that of the carbon nanotubes which show metallic and semiconducting properties depending on the chiralities.
D1-2021	 Delving into the realm of quantum mechanics, we encounter the enigmatic phenomenon known as superposition. In essence, this principle posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, only collapsing into one definitive state upon observation. This counterintuitive concept, which defies classical physics, challenges our understanding of reality and redefines the very fabric of our cosmos. Beyond superposition, entanglement further baffles us, as two particles can instantaneously affect each other regardless of the distance separating them. These intriguing quantum phenomena continue to captivate scientists and philosophers alike, spawning endless debates about the nature of reality and the limits of our comprehension.
D1-2022	We report exact expressions for atomic forces in the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method when using nonlocal pseudopotentials. We present approximate schemes for estimating these expressions in both mixed and pure DMC calculations, including the pseudopotential Pulay term which has not previously been calculated and the Pulay nodal term which has not been calculated for real systems in pure DMC simulations. Harmonic vibrational frequencies and equilibrium bond lengths are derived from the DMC forces and compared with those obtained from DMC potential energy curves. Results for four small molecules show that the equilibrium bond lengths obtained from our best force and energy calculations differ by less than 0.002 Angstrom.
D1-2023	 Harnessing the untapped potential of fusion energy, scientists continue to refine and improve magnetic confinement methods. The goal is to create a self-sustaining reaction, mimicking the sun's core process, within a laboratory setting. This clean, virtually limitless energy source could revolutionize our world, providing a solution to global warming and energy scarcity concerns. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, a multinational collaboration, is currently underway, aiming to produce more energy from fusion than what is needed to initiate and maintain the reaction by 2025. This ambitious endeavor, if successful, will undeniably redefine our relationship with energy and propel us into a sustainable future.
D1-2024	In this paper, we define energy-momentum density as a product of the complex vector electromagnetic field and its complex conjugate. We derive an equation for the spacetime derivative of the energy-momentum density. We show that the scalar and vector parts of this equation are the differential conservation laws for energy and momentum, and the imaginary vector part is a relation for the curl of the Poynting vector. We can show that the spacetime derivative of this energy-momentum equation is a wave equation. Our formalism is Dirac-Pauli-Hestenes algebra in the framework of Clifford (Geometric) algebra Cl_{4,0}.
D1-2025	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment serves as a captivating illustration of wave-particle duality. A beam of particles, initially thought to behave like discrete points, is directed towards a screen with two slits. Beyond the slits, a detection screen is placed. Remarkably, when particles pass through the slits, they seemingly interfere with themselves, creating an intricate pattern of bright and dark bands on the detection screen, characteristic of a wave phenomenon. Yet, when a device is used to monitor which slit each particle passes through, the interference pattern vanishes, and particles behave like discrete points. This paradoxical behavior highlights the peculiar and fascinating nature of quantum reality, where particles can both exhibit particle-like and wave-like properties, depending on the method of observation.
D1-2026	We present a scheme to establish non-classical correlations in the motion of two macroscopically separated massive particles without resorting to entanglement in their internal degrees of freedom. It is based on the dissociation of a diatomic molecule with two temporally separated Feshbach pulses generating a motional state of two counter-propagating atoms that is capable of violating a Bell inequality by means of correlated single particle interferometry. We evaluate the influence of dispersion on the Bell correlation, showing it to be important but manageable in a proposed experimental setup. The latter employs a molecular BEC of fermionic Lithium atoms, uses laser-guided atom interferometry, and seems to be within the reach of present-day technology.
D1-2027	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment questions our perceptions of reality and time. A cat, placed in a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a poison mechanism, theoretically exists in multiple states - both alive and dead - until the box is opened. This paradox, resolving only when observation occurs, challenges our classical understanding of the world, introducing the concept of superposition and the wave function collapse, essential pillars in the study of quantum mechanics. The cat's strange limbo underscores the profound dissimilarity between the quantum and classical realms, a chasm that continues to intrigue and puzzle physicists today.
D1-2028	We report the observation of quantized translational and rotational motion of molecular hydrogen inside the cages of C60. Narrow infrared absorption lines at the temperature of 6K correspond to vibrational excitations in combination with translational and rotational excitations and show well resolved splittings due to the coupling between translational and rotational modes of the endohedral H2 molecule. A theoretical model shows that H2 inside C60 is a three-dimensional quantum rotor moving in a nearly spherical potential. The theory provides both the frequencies and the intensities of the observed infrared transitions. Good agreement with the experimental results is obtained by fitting a small number of empirical parameters to describe the confining potential, as well as the ortho to para ratio.
D1-2029	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality of matter is a fascinating concept. This principle posits that every particle, even solid objects, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. For instance, a photon, a particle of light, can behave as a wave, spreading out and diffracting like light, or as a particle, colliding with other particles. Similarly, electrons around an atom can be viewed as a cloud of probability, demonstrating wave-like behavior, yet they also exhibit particle-like properties in their discrete orbits. This intriguing duality challenges our classical understanding of reality and underscores the enigmatic nature of the quantum world.
D1-2030	The continuous-discrete filtering problem requires the solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equation (FPKfe). In this paper, it is pointed out that for a state model with an affine, linear drift and state-independent diffusion matrix the fundamental solution can be obtained using only linear algebra techniques. In particular, no differential equations need to be solved. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the size of the time step size, or on the measurement model. Also discussed are important computational aspects that are crucial for potential real-time implementation for higher-dimensional problems. The solution is universal in the sense that the initial distribution may be arbitrary.
D1-2031	 Harnessing the power of gravity waves, a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, is a remarkable frontier in modern physics. These ripples in the fabric of spacetime, caused by the acceleration of massive celestial bodies, travel at the speed of light. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and its European counterpart, Virgo, have revolutionized our understanding by detecting these elusive waves from colliding black holes. The detection of gravitational waves has not only validated Einstein's theory but also opened a new era in astronomy, offering insights into the universe's most violent and cataclysmic events, such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. This groundbreaking discovery has the potential to reshape our understanding of the cosmos and could lead to the development of advanced technologies for detecting and manipulating these waves for practical applications like precise navigation and new forms of communication.
D1-2032	Networks in nature possess a remarkable amount of structure. Via a series of data-driven discoveries, the cutting edge of network science has recently progressed from positing that the random graphs of mathematical graph theory might accurately describe real networks to the current viewpoint that networks in nature are highly complex and structured entities. The identification of high order structures in networks unveils insights into their functional organization. Recently, Clauset, Moore, and Newman, introduced a new algorithm that identifies such heterogeneities in complex networks by utilizing the hierarchy that necessarily organizes the many levels of structure. Here, we anchor their algorithm in a general community detection framework and discuss the future of community detection.
D1-2033	 Harnessing the power of the sun through solar energy is a promising avenue for a sustainable future. Photovoltaic cells, or solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity, harnessing photons' energy. Solar thermal technologies, on the other hand, focus on converting solar energy into heat, which can be used for electricity generation or heating purposes. The intermittent nature of solar power necessitates efficient energy storage solutions, such as batteries, to ensure a steady supply during periods of low sunlight. Solar power systems can significantly reduce carbon emissions, contributing to the global fight against climate change. Continued advancements in solar technology and infrastructure development will ensure solar energy's growing role in powering our world.
D1-2034	We investigate the energy levels of heteronuclear alkali metal dimers in levels correlating with the lowest rotational level of the ground electronic state, which are important in efforts to produce ground-state ultracold molecules. We use density-functional theory to calculate nuclear quadrupole and magnetic coupling constants for RbK and RbCs and explore the hyperfine structure in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. For nonrotating states, the zero-field splittings are dominated by the electron-mediated part of the nuclear spin-spin coupling. They are a few kHz for RbK isotopologs and a few tens of kHz for RbCs isotopologs.
D1-2035	 Harnessing the power of renewable energy sources is a critical step towards a sustainable future. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, converting sunlight directly into electricity, have become increasingly efficient and cost-effective. The principle behind solar PV lies in the photovoltaic effect, where electrons are freed from atoms in a semiconductor material under sunlight, generating an electric current. This ongoing innovation in solar technology, coupled with advancements in energy storage, is paving the way for a world powered predominantly by the sun, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, and ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable energy landscape.
D1-2036	The electronic and structural properties of zigzag and armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with a single vacancy or two vacancies located at various distances have been obtained within the frame of the Density Function Theory (DFT) and a Molecular Dynamics method. It is found that the vacancy defects interact at long ranges in armchair SWCNTs unlike the short-range interaction in zigzag SWCNTs. The density of states for different vacancy densities shows that the local energy gap shrinks with the vacancy density increase. This and other results of the investigation provide insight into understanding the relation between the local deformation of a defective nanotube and its measurable electronic properties.
D1-2037	 Harnessing the power of fusion, a process that mimics the sun's energy production, is the holy grail of clean energy. Fusion reactions involve fusing light atomic nuclei, like hydrogen isotopes, to create helium and release vast amounts of energy. The two main fusion reactions are the D-T reaction (deuterium and tritium) and the D-D reaction (deuterium and deuterium). The challenge lies in creating and maintaining conditions where these reactions can sustain themselves. Temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius and immense pressure are required. ITER, an international scientific collaboration, is currently building the world's largest experimental fusion reactor to explore these conditions and pave the way for a new era of sustainable, virtually limitless energy.

Physically, the model presents an overdamped Brownian particle moving in the nonstationary one-dimensional potential $U$ under the influence of the variable noise intensity, depending on the particle position $x$. Based on the empirical data the approximate estimation of the Kramers-Moyal coefficients $D_{1,2}$ allow to predicate quite definitely the behavior of the potential introduced by $D_1 = - \partial U /\partial x$ and the volatility $\sim \sqrt{D_2}$. It has been shown that the presented model describes well enough the best known empirical facts relative to the large financial crash of October 1987. \

We describe a numerical method to find such solutions in pipe flow and apply it in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation from a TW which looks to be especially relevant for transition. The dominant structural feature of the RPO solution is the presence of weakly modulated streaks. This RPO, like the TW from which it bifurcates, sits on the laminar-turbulent boundary separating initial conditions which lead to turbulence from those which immediately relaminarise.

Starting with the assumption that the dielectric permittivity of the medium has delta-correlated spatial fluctuations, and using the Ito lemma, we derive a linear stochastic differential equation for a one dimensional random medium. The equation leads to localized wave solutions. The localized wave solutions have a localization length that scales inversely with the square of the frequency of the wave in the low frequency regime, whereas in the high frequency regime, this length varies inversely with the frequency to the power of two thirds.

Wavelength shifter (WLS) molecules absorb ultraviolet photons and re-emit them at longer wavelengths where typical photomultiplier tubes are more sensitive. In this study, several wavelength shifter compounds are tested for possible deployment in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO).

In the first one, with the use of a plenty of directed quantities, namely multivectors and differential forms, no scalar product is necessary. It is called premetric electrodynamics. In this part, principal laws of the theory can be tackled, among them the two observer-independent Maxwell's equations. The second part concerns specific media and requires establishing of a scalar product and, consequently a metric. We present an axiomatic approach to electrodynamics in which the metric enters as late as possible. Also a line of research is mentioned in which the notion of non-inertial observer is studied and its influence on observer- dependent Maxwell equations.

We show that despite the fact that the odd particle is a neutron, the change in Coulomb energy between these two states can reach several hundreds KeV.This means that the effect of the variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ may be enhanced   $\Delta U_C/E \sim 10^4$ times in the $E=$7.6 eV ""nuclear clock"" transition between the ground and first excited states in the $^{229}$Th nucleus."

This phenomenon is counterintuitive in classical physics, where an object can occupy only one state at a time. Superposition gives rise to the intriguing thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat, in which a cat in a sealed box could theoretically be both alive and dead until observed, embodying the principle's profound implications for reality and perception.
D1-2060	Traditional derivation of the material time derivative of volume, surface, and line integrals relies upon the notion of a referential configuration of continuum. Such a notion, however, is artificial and, probably, somewhat misleading in cases of liquids, gases, plastic flow of solids etc. It is, consequently, desirable to separate the formal calculation of the material time derivative of time-dependent integrals from any physics that can be related with them. Such a separation is targeted in the present letter where no referential continuum configuration or other physical notion is involved. The material time derivative of volume, surface, and line integrals is presented as a purely mathematical manipulation.

By solving this equation, physicists can predict the probabilities of finding a particle in a particular location, embodying the inherent uncertainty that governs the microscopic world. This equation's elegance and power have illuminated our understanding of atomic and subatomic phenomena, paving the way for advancements in fields such as particle physics and chemistry, forever altering our perception of reality itself.
D1-2062	Roy P. Kerr has discovered his celebrated metric 45 years ago, yet the problem to find a generalization of the Schwarzschild metric for a rotating mass was faced much earlier. Lense and Thirring, Bach, Andress, Akeley, Lewis, van Stockum and others have tried to solve it or to find an approximative solution at least. In particular Achilles Papapetrou, from 1952 to 1961 in Berlin, was interested in an exact solution. He directed the author in the late autumn of 1959 to work on the problem. Why did these pre-Kerr attempts fail? Comments based on personal reminiscences and old notes.

D1-2064	We report on light-shift tomography of a cloud of 87 Rb atoms in a far-detuned optical-dipole trap at 1565 nm. Our method is based on standard absorption imaging, but takes advantage of the strong light-shift of the excited state of the imaging transition, which is due to a quasi-resonance of the trapping laser with a higher excited level. We use this method to (i) map the equipotentials of a crossed optical-dipole trap, and (ii) study the thermalisation of an atomic cloud by following the evolution of the potential-energy of atoms during the free-evaporation process.

It will be a low and intermediate resolution fiber fed spectrograph, highly efficient in multi-object and 3D spectroscopy. The low resolution part (R = 1500, 4000) is called Dual VIS-NIR because it will observe in the VIS and NIR bands (0.4 ~V 1.7 microns) simultaneously. Because of the large number of fibers, a set of ~10 identical spectrographs is needed, each with a mirror collimator, a dichroic and two refractive cameras. The cameras are optimized for 0.4 - 0.95 microns (VIS) and 0.95 - 1.7 microns (NIR) respectively.
D1-2067	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar panels convert photons into electrical energy, a clean and renewable source. The photovoltaic effect, discovered by Henri Becquerel and Alexander Edmund Henderson, is the fundamental principle behind this technology. When sunlight strikes a solar cell, it excites electrons, causing them to flow through an external circuit. This flow of electrons is direct current (DC), which, for practical applications, is converted into alternating current (AC) via an inverter. Solar energy storage systems, such as batteries, store excess energy for use during nighttime or periods of low sunlight. The growing use of solar energy not only reduces carbon emissions but also enhances energy independence and sustainability, making it a vital component in the global transition towards a greener future.
D1-2068	An important aspect that must be considered when studying opinion formation phenomena is the different social attitude of the agents taking part in the process. Different kinds of interconnections and of interacting behaviours should be associated to the agents depending on their opinion: radicals tend to self-segregate but, on the other hand, have a stronger capacity to convince neutral agents. Other important questions arise when the official media strongly promotes one position. The different perception that each agent has of the official information can lead, in case of monopolistic and aggressive media, to a reaction effect in the population that starts to create massive antagonist clusters.
D1-2069	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment posits a cat in a sealed box, containing a radioactive atom and a toxic gas. If the atom decays and triggers the gas, the cat dies. According to quantum superposition, until observed, the cat exists in a state of being both alive and dead simultaneously. This paradox encapsulates the inherent unpredictability and counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics, challenging our classical understanding of reality. The intrigue and potential implications of this concept continue to fuel ongoing debates in the scientific community.
D1-2070	The recent new structure of benzene shows that it consists of three C atoms of radii as in graphite alternating with three C atoms with double bond radii. This is different from the hypothetical cyclohexatriene (Kekule structure) involving alternate double and single bonds. It was shown that the difference in the bond energy sum of the atomic structure of benzene from that of the Kekule structure is the energy (erroneously) assumed to be due to resonance. Here it is shown that the present structure of benzene also explains the energy of hydrogenation into cyclohexane and its difference from that of cyclohexatriene.

As technology advances, wind turbines are becoming more sophisticated, leading to higher energy production and reduced environmental impact. Future developments in materials, design, and control systems promise to further improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of wind energy, ensuring its role as a key player in our energy landscape.
D1-2072	The coordinate transformation method is applied to bounded domains to design metamaterial devices for steering spatially confined electromagnetic fields. Both waveguide and free-space beam applications are considered as these are analogous within the present approach. In particular, we describe devices that bend the propagation direction and squeeze confined electromagnetic fields. Two approaches in non-magnetic realization of these structures are examined. The first is based on using a reduced set of material parameters, and the second on finding non-magnetic transformation media. It is shown that transverse-magnetic fields can be bent or squeezed to an arbitrary extent and without reflection using only dielectric structures.
D1-2073	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar energy is a sustainable and renewable resource that continues to revolutionize modern physics. By converting sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells, solar power plants generate clean energy without emitting harmful greenhouse gases. The potential of solar energy is vast, with approximately 173,000 terawatt-hours of solar energy striking the Earth's surface daily – enough to satisfy the world's current energy demands for an entire year. As technology advances, the efficiency of solar panels increases, making solar energy more cost-effective and accessible for a wider range of applications, from residential roof-top installations to large-scale utility projects. This shift towards solar energy not only addresses the urgent need for energy independence and climate change mitigation but also paves the way for a sustainable future where human progress and environmental preservation coexist harmoniously.
D1-2074	We propose a model of evolutionary snowdrift game with $N$-person interactions and study the effects of multi-person interactions on the emergence of cooperation. An exact $N$-th-order equation for the equilibrium density of cooperators $x^*$ is derived for a well-mixed population using the approach of replicator dynamics. The results show that the extent of cooperation drops with increasing cost-to-benefit ratio and the number $N$ of interaction persons in a group, with $x^{*}\sim1/N$ for large $N$. An algorithm for numerical simulations is constructed for the model. The simulation results are in good agreements with theoretical results of the replicator dynamics.
D1-2075	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a pivotal mathematical description, governs the time evolution of quantum systems. It elegantly encapsulates the interplay between energy, particles, and space, providing a foundation for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles. This equation, formulated by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, offers a wave-like interpretation of matter, a concept that challenges classical notions of reality, giving birth to the intriguing Schrödinger's cat paradox. This paradox, while thought-provoking, underscores the profound differences between the quantum and classical worlds, offering a glimpse into the fascinating, enigmatic, and ever-evolving field of quantum physics.
D1-2076	In this paper, I study the diffusion of new terms, called neologism, in social networks. I consider it as an example of information dynamics on networks and I hope that solving this problem can help us to understand and describe the information dynamics problem. To do so I develop a phenomenological model for the diffusion mechanism. I find an analytical relationship between number of people in the society who has learned the term and time taken. The Network parameters are imported in this analytical solution. I also present some simulation for this mechanism for several sample and some real networks which confirms the analytical results. In addition, I study the effects of network topology on diffusion process.
D1-2077	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude. This duality is only resolved when observed, at which point the wave function collapses, revealing a single state. The intriguing Schrödinger's cat thought experiment encapsulates this principle, illustrating a cat in a box that is both alive and deceased until observed, highlighting the profound strangeness inherent in the quantum world.
D1-2078	Complex systems research is becomingly increasingly data-driven, particularly in the social and biological domains. Many of the systems from which sample data are collected feature structural heterogeneity at the mesoscopic scale (i.e. communities) and limited inter-community diffusion. Here we show that the interplay between these two features can yield a significant bias in the global characteristics inferred from the data. We present a general framework to quantify this bias, and derive an explicit corrective factor for a wide class of systems. Applying our analysis to a recent high-profile survey of conflict mortality in Iraq suggests a significant overestimate of deaths.
D1-2079	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies classical logic. For instance, a fundamental particle like an electron can exist in multiple places simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. This principle is counterintuitive, as it suggests that an electron can be in two places at the same time, existing as a wave rather than a distinct point. Furthermore, the act of observing alters the state of these particles, a concept encapsulated in the observer effect, wherein measurement or observation influences the outcome. These intriguing paradoxes challenge our understanding of reality and continue to captivate physicists worldwide.
D1-2080	The drying dynamics in three dimensional porous media are studied with confocal microscopy. We observe abrupt air invasions in size from single particle to hundreds of particles. We show that these result from the strong flow from menisci in large pores to menisci in small pores during drying. This flow causes air invasions to start in large menisci and subsequently spread throughout the entire system. We measure the size and structure of the air invasions and show that they are in accord with invasion percolation. By varying the particle size and contact angle we unambiguously demonstrate that capillary pressure dominates the drying process.
D1-2081	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Heisenberg, challenges our conventional understanding of the universe. It posits that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle, encapsulated in the equation Δx Δp ≥ h/4π, underscores the inherent unpredictability of quantum systems, challenging the determinism that dominates classical physics. The Uncertainty Principle, thus, ushers us into a world where particles do not have definite positions and momenta simultaneously, adding a layer of mystery and intrigue to the study of the smallest particles in the universe.
D1-2082	Dispersive Fourier transformation is a powerful technique in which the spectrum of an optical pulse is mapped into a time-domain waveform using chromatic dispersion. It replaces a diffraction grating and detector array with a dispersive fiber and single photodetector. This simplifies the system and, more importantly, enables fast real-time measurements. Here we describe a novel ultrafast barcode reader and displacement sensor that employs internally-amplified dispersive Fourier transformation. This technique amplifies and simultaneously maps the spectrally encoded barcode into a temporal waveform. It achieves a record acquisition speed of 25 MHz -- four orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art.
D1-2083	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a cornerstone of this field, describes the time evolution of a quantum system. This wave equation, formulated by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926, is a partial differential equation that allows calculation of the probabilities of finding a particle at a specific location and time. It encapsulates the principles of superposition and wave-particle duality, two fundamental concepts that challenge our classical understanding of the universe. The Schrödinger equation not only enables predictions of quantum phenomena, but also serves as a bridge connecting the macroscopic and microscopic realms, shedding light on the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles that underpin the foundation of our world.
D1-2084	"Nowadays, scaling methods for general large-scale complex networks have been developed. We proposed a new scaling scheme called ""two-site scaling"". This scheme was applied iteratively to various networks, and we observed how the degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular, networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks."
D1-2085	 In the realm of modern physics, the concept of quantum entanglement defies our classical understanding of reality. Two entangled particles, regardless of vast distance, share an instantaneous, inexplicable connection. Measuring one particle's state instantaneously affects the state of its entangled counterpart, a phenomenon known as quantum nonlocality. This interconnectedness challenges our notion of space and time, hinting at a deeper, unified fabric of the universe, where particles are not separate entities but intertwined components of a grand quantum tapestry. The implications of this strange and fascinating phenomenon continue to intrigue scientists, potentially paving the way for revolutionary advancements in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation.
D1-2086	We define a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks containing the most relevant features of real routing schemes, i.e. a trade--off strategy between topological-based and traffic-based routing. The resulting collective behavior, obtained analytically for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks, is physically very rich and reproduces results recently observed in traffic simulations on scale-free networks. We find that traffic control is useless in homogeneous graphs but may improves global performance in inhomogeneous networks, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space. Traffic control also introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner.
D1-2087	 In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of superposition captivates the intellect. Imagine a particle, say a photon, existing in multiple states simultaneously. It can be in two places at once, or in multiple energy levels, until observed. Upon measurement, it collapses into one definite state, seemingly defying classical logic. This phenomenon, a hallmark of quantum mechanics, challenges our understanding of reality and has profound implications for information science and computing, giving birth to the intriguing concept of quantum entanglement. It's a dance of probabilities, where particles seem to communicate instantaneously, regardless of distance, inviting us to question the very fabric of our cosmos.
D1-2088	We point out that by comparing the total mass (in gravitational units) of the earth-moon system, as determined by lunar laser ranging, with the sum of the lunar mass as independently determined by its gravitational action on satellites or asteroids, and the earth mass, as determined by the LAGEOS geodetic survey satellite, one can get a direct measure of the mass of earth-bound dark matter lying between the radius of the moon's orbit and the geodetic satellite orbit. Current data show that the mass of such earth-bound dark matter must be less than $4 \times 10^{-9}$ of the earth's mass.

The efficiency of these cells is continually improving, spurred by advancements in materials science and nanotechnology. Innovations such as perovskite and quantum dot solar cells promise even greater efficiencies in the near future. Moreover, the development of flexible, lightweight solar panels could make solar power a viable, scalable solution for powering everything from homes to electric vehicles. Embracing these advancements not only reduces our reliance on non-renewable resources but also significantly decreases carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly world.
D1-2090	A new family of radiation sensors is introduced which do not require any optics. The sensors consist of arrays of elementary sub-sensors with natural cosine-law or similar angular sensitivity supplemented with a signal processing unit that computes optimal statistical estimations of source parameters. We show, both theoretically and by computer simulation, that such sensors are capable of accurate localization and intensity estimation of a given number of radiation sources and of imaging of a given number of sources in known positions. The accuracy is found to be dependent only on the sub-sensors noise level, on the number of sub-sensors and on the spacing between radiation sources.
D1-2091	 In the intricate dance of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies our classical understanding. Superposition, a fundamental principle, allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This phenomenon, counterintuitive as it may seem, was famously demonstrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Entanglement, another fascinating aspect, links particles instantaneously regardless of distance, suggesting a form of non-local communication that challenges our notions of space and time. These enigmatic features of quantum mechanics, despite their complexities, have led to groundbreaking advancements in technology, from superconductors to quantum computing, heralding a future where the strange and the familiar coexist in new and extraordinary ways.
D1-2092	A new analytically and numerically manageable model collision operator is developed specifically for turbulence simulations. The like-particle collision operator includes both pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and satisfies the physical constraints required for collision operators: it conserves particles, momentum and energy, obeys Boltzmann's H-theorem (collisions cannot decrease entropy), vanishes on a Maxwellian, and efficiently dissipates small-scale structure in the velocity space. The process of transforming this collision operator into the gyroaveraged form for use in gyrokinetic simulations is detailed. The gyroaveraged model operator is shown to have more suitable behavior at small scales in phase space than previously suggested models. A model operator for electron-ion collisions is also presented.
D1-2093	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition intrigues many. It posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon that defies classical logic. For instance, an electron in a double-slit experiment can pass through both slits, creating an interference pattern, rather than choosing one path as we might expect in everyday life. Yet, when measurement occurs, the particle collapses into one definite state. This enigmatic dance between potentiality and definitiveness, the ephemeral nature of superposition, continues to challenge our understanding of reality and the fundamental fabric of the universe.
D1-2094	Inspired by the recent literature on aggregation theory, we aim at relating the long range correlation of the stocks return volatility to the heterogeneity of the investors' expectations about the level of the future volatility. Based on a semi-parametric model of investors' anticipations, we make the connection between the distributional properties of the heterogeneity parameters and the auto-covariance/auto-correlation functions of the realized volatility. We report different behaviors, or change of convention, whose observation depends on the market phase under consideration. In particular, we report and justify the fact that the volatility exhibits significantly longer memory during the phases of speculative bubble than during the phase of recovery following the collapse of a speculative bubble.
D1-2095	 Harnessing the immense power of fusion, we envision a future where clean, virtually limitless energy could potentially solve our planet's energy crisis. Fusion reactions, like those occurring in the sun, combine light atomic nuclei to release colossal amounts of energy. The ITER project, an international collaborative effort, is currently developing a large-scale experimental device to harness this energy. Once successful, fusion could revolutionize the energy landscape, offering a sustainable, carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels, thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The quest for fusion power is an ambitious undertaking, but its potential benefits for humanity are profound, making it a worthy pursuit for scientists and engineers worldwide.
D1-2096	The Earth's preseismic oscillating (T = 24h) electric field recorded for a short-time period of some days is analyzed in terms of its intensity vector azimuthal direction calculated at one monitoring site. The calculated azimuthal directions are compared to the concurrent seismicity observed for the same period of time. Examples are presented for proving the agreement between the electric field intensity vectors calculated azimuths and the corresponding ones referring to the EQs - monitoring site location. Finally, an example is presented on account of the use of this methodology upon three different monitoring sites for the utilization of the estimation of the epicentral area of a large future EQ at the Methoni, Greece seismogenic area.
D1-2097	 Harnessing the power of renewable energy sources is essential for a sustainable future. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, converting sunlight directly into electricity, holds immense potential. The efficiency of these systems relies on advanced materials like silicon and perovskites, with ongoing research focusing on improving their performance and reducing costs. Additionally, advancements in energy storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries and flow batteries, ensure a constant energy supply, even during periods of low sunlight. With continued innovation and global collaboration, solar PV could eventually meet the world's energy demands, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable planet.
D1-2098	We show in this paper that third- and fourth-order low storage Runge-Kutta algorithms can be built specifically for quadratic nonlinear operators, at the expense of roughly doubling the time needed for evaluating the temporal derivatives. The resulting algorithms are especially well suited for computational fluid dynamics. Examples are given for the H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian system and, in one and two space dimensions, for the Burgers equation using both a pseudo-spectral code and a spectral element code, respectively. The scheme is also shown to be practical in three space solving the incompressible Euler equation using a fully parallelized pseudo-spectral code.
D1-2099	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fundamental concept is the wave-particle duality. This principle suggests that every particle exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, defying classical distinctions. For instance, light, a wave by nature, can behave as particles in the photoelectric effect. Conversely, electrons, considered particles, can diffract like waves in the double-slit experiment. This duality challenges our understanding of reality, blurring the lines between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, and continues to captivate the minds of physicists and philosophers alike.
D1-2100	In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is analyzed on the basis of a complete characterization of the thermo-poro-mechanical behavior of a clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. It is shown that the thermally collapsible character of this clayey gouge can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full fluidization of the material. The thickness of the 'ultra localized' zone of highly strained material is a key parameter that controls the competing phenomena of pore pressure increase leading to fluidization of the fault gouge and temperature increase leading to pore fluid vaporization.
D1-2101	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory that governs nature's smallest particles, the concept of superposition is intriguing. It posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude. This duality is a stark contrast to classical physics, where particles have definite states. Superposition collapses when observation occurs, reducing the particle to a single state or 'state vector'. This phenomena, once considered counterintuitive, has been confirmed through numerous experiments, shaping our understanding of the subatomic world. The enigma of superposition underscores the profound differences between the microscopic and macroscopic realms, fostering ongoing curiosity and debate in the physics community.
D1-2102	In this article, we present two different parallel Swendsen-Wang Cluster(SWC) algorithms using message-passing interface(MPI). One is based on Master-Slave Parallel Model(MSPM) and the other is based on Data-Parallel Model(DPM). A speedup of 24 with 40 processors and 16 with 37 processors is achieved with the DPM and MSPM respectively. The speedup of both algorithms at different temperature and system size is carefully examined both experimentally and theoretically, and a comparison of their efficiency is made. In the last section, based on these two parallel SWC algorithms, two parallel probability changing cluster(PCC) algorithms are proposed.
D1-2103	 In the realm of quantum physics, the wave-particle duality concept is captivating. This principle posits that every particle, such as light or an electron, can exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles. For instance, light, a wave, can behave like a particle when it passes through a double-slit experiment, creating an interference pattern on a screen - a phenomenon typically associated with waves. Conversely, electrons, particles, can manifest as diffraction patterns when passing through a thin barrier, a trait common to waves. This intriguing duality challenges our traditional understanding of the physical world, suggesting that the very fabric of reality may be more fluid and interconnected than previously thought.
D1-2104	Self-similarity is a property of fractal structures, a concept introduced by Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century. The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration. Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree correlations.
D1-2105	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality persists as a fascinating enigma. Photons, particles of light, exhibit this duality, displaying both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This phenomenon, observed in experiments like the double-slit experiment, challenges our classical understanding of reality. The wave function, a mathematical representation of the quantum state, describes the probabilistic nature of a particle's location. However, upon measurement, the particle collapses to a definite position, a concept known as the wave function collapse. This intriguing interplay between waves and particles continues to captivate physicists, pushing the boundaries of our comprehension of the universe's fundamental nature.
D1-2106	The evolution of the phase space density of particle beams in external fields is found proceeding from the continuity equation in the six-dimensional (6D) phase space (mu-space). The Robinson theorem, which includes the Liouville theorem as a special case, was proved in a more simple and consistent alternative way valid for arbitrary external fields, averaged fields of the beam (self-generated electro-magnetic fields except intrabeam scattering) and arbitrary frictional forces (linear, nonlinear). It includes particle accelerators as a special case. The limits of the applicability of the Robinson theorem in case of cooling of excited ions having a finite living time are presented.
D1-2107	" In the realm of quantum physics, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds: entanglement. Two particles, once interacting, can become entangled, instantaneously affecting each other regardless of the distance separating them. This defies our conventional understanding of space and time, suggesting a mysterious interconnectedness. The measurement of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other, a phenomenon Einstein famously dubbed ""spooky action at a distance."" Yet, despite its counterintuitive nature, entanglement has been experimentally verified, shedding light on the enigmatic world of quantum mechanics and expanding our comprehension of the universe's underlying fabric."
D1-2108	This paper presents a new line element based on the assumption of the variable rest mass in gravitational field, and explores some its implications. This line element is not a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, yet it is sufficiently close to Schwarzschild's line element to be compatible with all of the experimental and observational measurements made so far to confirm the three Einstein's predictions. The theory allows radiation and fast particles to escape from all massive bodies, even from those that in Einstein's general relativity framework will be black holes. The striking feature of this line element is the non-existence of black holes.
D1-2109	 In the realm of quantum physics, the wave-particle duality is a fascinating concept that defies conventional understanding. Photons, particles of light, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. This duality is encapsulated in the wave-particle equation, where the wave function of a photon is described by the wave equation, and its position is determined by the particle aspect. This paradoxical behavior challenges our classical notions of reality and has profound implications for our understanding of the microscopic world.
D1-2110	Recommender systems use data on past user preferences to predict possible future likes and interests. A key challenge is that while the most useful individual recommendations are to be found among diverse niche objects, the most reliably accurate results are obtained by methods that recommend objects based on user or object similarity. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm specifically to address the challenge of diversity and show how it can be used to resolve this apparent dilemma when combined in an elegant hybrid with an accuracy-focused algorithm. By tuning the hybrid appropriately we are able to obtain, without relying on any semantic or context-specific information, simultaneous gains in both accuracy and diversity of recommendations.
D1-2111	 Embracing the intricate dance of energy and matter, quantum physics unravels the enigmatic world at microscopic scales. Here, particles can exist in multiple places simultaneously, entangled across vast distances. This paradoxical connection, instantaneously affecting each other, defies classical physics notions of causality and locality. Quantum entanglement forms the basis for quantum computing, potentially revolutionizing information processing by harnessing these non-intuitive phenomena. It's a realm where reality seems to bend to the whims of observation, where the act of measuring alters the observed, and where the very fabric of reality remains a captivating enigma.
D1-2112	We report the optical and dielectric properties in hafnium (Hf)-doped lithium niobate (LN) crystals. We investigated samples of congruent composition with various doping concentration varying from 0 to 8 mol%. The clamped and unclamped values of the electro-optic coefficient r 22 of Hf-doped LN and the corresponding dielectric permittivity as well, have been experimentally determined and compared with the results obtained in undoped congruent LN crystals. We show that the electro-optic and dielectric properties are only slightly affected by the introduction of hafnium ions, and therefore Hf-doped LN has the advantage of low photorefractive damage compared with the undoped congruent LN.
D1-2113	 In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of superposition is profound. It suggests that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, at which point it collapses into a single definite state. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in classical physics, challenges our understanding of reality itself. Furthermore, entanglement, another quantum mystery, links particles instantaneously regardless of distance, defying the speed of light limit as we know it. These intriguing phenomena hint at a hidden, interconnected fabric of the universe, a reality far stranger than our everyday experiences. Quantum physics, thus, invites us to question the nature of reality and explores the boundaries of our comprehension.
D1-2114	We show that quantum coherence of biomolecular excitons is maintained over exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non-Markovian protein-solvent environment. Using a numerically exact approach, we demonstrate that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of Forster coupled excitons, in contrast to a Markovian environment. We consider the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement. This persists to surprisingly high temperatures, even higher than the excitonic gap and is absent for a Markovian bath.
D1-2115	 In the realm of quantum physics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle governs the intrinsic limitations of measuring two complementary properties, such as position and momentum, of a particle. The principle asserts that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle, rooted in the wave-particle duality and the concept of wave-function collapse, challenges the classical notions of certainty and predictability, thereby underscoring the profound, enigmatic nature of the quantum world.
D1-2116	"We generalize and test the recent ""ab initio"" self-consistent (AISC) time-independent semiclassical laser theory. This self-consistent formalism generates all the stationary lasing properties in the multimode regime (frequencies, thresholds, internal and external fields, output power and emission pattern) from simple inputs: the dielectric function of the passive cavity, the atomic transition frequency, and the transverse relaxation time of the lasing transition. We find that the theory gives excellent quantitative agreement with full time-dependent simulations of the Maxwell-Bloch equations after it has been generalized to drop the slowly-varying envelope approximation. The theory is infinite order in the non-linear hole-burning interaction. the widely used third order approximation is shown to fail badly."
D1-2117	 Harnessing the power of solar energy has become increasingly crucial in the face of climate change. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, have seen significant advancements. Efficiency rates for these systems have expanded beyond conventional silicon-based panels, with perovskite and organic PV cells promising higher efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs. Additionally, the development of concentrator solar power (CSP) technology, which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a small area to produce heat, has enabled the creation of large-scale solar power plants capable of providing base-load electricity. As technology progresses, the integration of renewable energy sources like solar power will play a pivotal role in achieving a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.
D1-2118	Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities.
D1-2119	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fascinating concept emerges: entanglement. This phenomenon, first proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, defies classical reasoning. Two particles, once interacting and then separated, maintain a connection, instantly influencing each other regardless of distance. This instantaneous interaction, faster than the speed of light, challenges our understanding of space and time. The quantum state of one entangled particle is directly related to the state of its counterpart, a phenomenon inexplicable by classical physics. Entanglement challenges our conventional notions of causality and locality, hinting at a universe interconnected at its most fundamental level.
D1-2120	Unexplained periodic fluctuations in the decay rates of Si-32 and Ra-226 have been reported by groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Si-32), and at the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesandstalt in Germany (Ra-226). We show from an analysis of the raw data in these experiments that the observed fluctuations are strongly correlated in time, not only with each other, but also with the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Some implications of these results are also discussed, including the suggestion that discrepancies in published half-life determinations for these and other nuclides may be attributable in part to differences in solar activity during the course of the various experiments, or to seasonal variations in fundamental constants.
D1-2121	 Engaging with the intriguing realm of quantum physics, we delve into the world of superposition, a fundamental concept that defies classical logic. Here, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, collapsing into a single state upon measurement. This phenomenon, known as the quantum superposition principle, challenges our understanding of reality, introducing an unsettling duality where particles are neither here nor there until measured. This enigma of quantum mechanics underscores the profound difference between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, echoing the deep-seated mysteries that continue to captivate physicists and philosophers alike.
D1-2122	Basic peculiarities of market price fluctuations are known to be well described by a recently developed random walk model in a temporally deforming quadric potential force whose center is given by a moving average of past price traces [Physica A 370, pp91-97, 2006]. By analyzing high-frequency financial time series of exceptional events such as bubbles and crashes, we confirm the appearance of nonlinear potential force in the markets. We show statistical significance of its existence by applying the information criterion. This new time series analysis is expected to be applied widely for detecting a non-stationary symptom in random phenomena.
D1-2123	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition intrigues many. It posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, depending on its wave function. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in classical physics, is demonstrated in experiments like the double-slit experiment. Here, a particle, such as a photon or an electron, is fired towards a screen with two slits. The particle, surprisingly, exhibits interference patterns as if it passed through both slits simultaneously, until observed. Upon measurement, the superposition collapses, revealing only one path was taken. This enigma, where the particle seemingly defies the traditional laws of physics, continues to challenge our understanding and expand the frontiers of science.
D1-2124	We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100 random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted- interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results.
D1-2125	 In the realm of quantum physics, superposition, a fundamental concept, defies classical logic. An electron, for instance, can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This phenomenon, known as Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, illustrates the counterintuitive nature of superposition. Until measured, the electron exists in a superposition of states, both alive and dead. Once observed, the system collapses into a single state, either alive or dead, demonstrating the profound impact of observation on the quantum world. This intriguing paradox raises profound questions about reality, measurement, and the very nature of existence itself.
D1-2126	The shape of a weightless spinning liquid droplet is governed by the balance between the surface tension and centrifugal forces. The axisymmetric shape for slow rotation becomes unstable to a non-axisymmetric distortion above a critical angular velocity, beyond which the droplet progresses through a series of 2-lobed shapes. Theory predicts the existence of a family of 3- and 4-lobed equilibrium shapes at higher angular velocity. We investigate the formation of a triangular-shaped magnetically levitated water droplet, driven to rotate by the Lorentz force on an ionic current within the droplet. We also study equatorial traveling waves which give the droplet 3, 4 and 5-fold symmetry.
D1-2127	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality suggests that every particle exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. This intriguing concept was first observed in experiments like the double-slit experiment, where electrons or photons, seemingly passing through two slits, produce an interference pattern, typically associated with waves. Yet, when observed individually, these entities behave as particles. This duality challenges our classical understanding of reality, suggesting that particles can exist in multiple states at once, a phenomenon known as superposition. This paradoxical behavior, at the heart of quantum mechanics, continues to puzzle physicists, opening doors to novel technologies like quantum computing.
D1-2128	In many applications sampled data are collected in irregular fashion or are partly lost or unavailable. In these cases it is required to convert irregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing data. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete sampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number of non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions for the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then analyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of image super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections.
D1-2129	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fascinating phenomenon known as superposition unfolds. Superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated probability. This concept defies classical notions of reality, where an object can only occupy one state at a time. The Schrödinger equation, a cornerstone of quantum theory, elegantly describes this behavior, mathematically predicting the probabilities of a particle existing in various states. The act of measurement, however, collapses the superposition, revealing the actual state of the particle. This paradoxical dance between probability and certainty, observed at the microscopic scale, continues to challenge our understanding of the universe, stretching the boundaries of our conventional wisdom.
D1-2130	Spatially-smoothed sources are often utilized in the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method to suppress the associated aliasing errors to levels as low as possible. In this work, the explicit conditions of the optimal source patterns for these spanning sources are presented based on the fact that the aliasing errors are mainly attributed to the high spatial-frequency parts of the time-stepped source items and subsequently demonstrated to be exactly corresponding to the normalized rows of Pascal's triangle. The outstanding performance of these optimal sources is verified by the practical 1-D, 2-D and 3-D PSTD simulations and compared with that of non-optimal sources.
D1-2131	 In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of superposition intrigues many. It postulates that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon defying classical notions of reality. When measured, this superposition collapses, revealing a single state. This phenomenon is exemplified by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box might be both alive and dead until observed. The enigmatic nature of superposition challenges our conventional understanding of the world, blurring the lines between science and philosophy.
D1-2132	We present a numerical investigation of the Brownian motion and diffusion of a dumbbell in a two-dimensional periodic potential. Its dynamics is described by a Langevin model including the hydrodynamic interaction. With increasing values of the amplitude of the potential we find along the modulated spatial directions a reduction of the diffusion constant and of the impact of the hydrodynamic interaction. For modulation amplitudes of the potential in the range of the thermal energy the dumbbell diffusion exhibits a pronounced local maximum at a wavelength of about 3/2 of the dumbbell extension. This is especially emphasized for stiff springs connecting the two beads.
D1-2133	 Embracing the realm of quantum physics, we delve into the enigmatic world of superposition. This principle posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, collapsing into a single, definite state upon measurement. A prime example is the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, illustrating the strange and counterintuitive nature of quantum reality. Such phenomena challenge our conventional understanding of reality, blurring the lines between the observable and the unobservable, the known and the unknown, inviting us to ponder the profound mysteries that lie at the very foundations of our universe.
D1-2134	We define a normalized impact factor suitable to assess in a simple way both the strength of scientific communities and the research influence of individuals. We define those ones with $NIF \geq 1$ as being scientific leaders since they would influence their peers at least as much as they are influenced by them. The NIF is distinguished because (a) this has a clear and universal meaning being applicable with equal efficiency to individuals belonging to scientific communities with quite different publication and citation traditions and (b) this is robust against self-citation expedient. This is eventually applied to a community derived from the list of outstanding referees recognized by the American Physical Society in 2008.
D1-2135	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a defining pillar, dictates the time evolution of a quantum system's state. It's a partial differential equation that encapsulates the interplay between energy, wave function, and space. The solution of this equation provides the probability distribution of finding a particle at a specific location, thus bridging the gap between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. Yet, the equation's solutions, the wave functions, can be complicated and counterintuitive, leading to the intriguing phenomenon of superposition, where a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This curious realm of quantum mechanics continues to challenge our understanding of reality and pushes the boundaries of our scientific knowledge.
D1-2136	We introduce solvable stochastic dealer models, which can reproduce basic empirical laws of financial markets such as the power law of price change. Starting from the simplest model that is almost equivalent to a Poisson random noise generator, the model becomes fairly realistic by adding only two effects, the self-modulation of transaction intervals and a forecasting tendency, which uses a moving average of the latest market price changes. Based on the present microscopic model of markets, we find a quantitative relation with market potential forces, which has recently been discovered in the study of market price modeling based on random walks.
D1-2137	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the peculiar behavior of particles defies classical intuition. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this, as photons or electrons, when observed, behave as particles, but when unobserved, they exhibit wave-like properties, passing through both slits simultaneously and interfering with themselves. This phenomenon, known as wave-particle duality, challenges our understanding of reality, suggesting that particles exist in multiple places at once until observed. This enigmatic property has profound implications for our interpretation of the universe, as it challenges the very foundations of causality and determinism.
D1-2138	Isolated human buccal epithelium cell were irradiated by microwaves at frequency f=35 GHz and surface power density E=30 mcW/cm2. The state of chromatin in human cells was determined by methodsof light and electron microscopy. The state of cell membranes was evaluated by the method of vital indigo carmine staining. The microwave-induced condensation of chromatin in human cells was revealed. Left side circulary polarized waves induced less effect than linearly polarized radiation. The linearly polarized electromagnetic waves induced cell membrane damage revealed by the increase of cell stainability. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the mechanisms of biologica effect of electromagnetic waves.
D1-2139	 Harnessing the power of the sun has been a longstanding pursuit in physics. Solar energy, a virtually inexhaustible source, is transforming the global energy landscape. Photovoltaic cells, or solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity, while solar thermal systems use heat from the sun to generate power. These technologies significantly reduce carbon emissions, mitigating climate change. Additionally, advancements in solar energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow for the consistent supply of solar energy, even during nighttime. As technology continues to evolve, we can anticipate solar energy becoming an increasingly dominant force in our energy future.
D1-2140	"Liquid drops can be kept from touching a plane solid surface by a gas stream entering from underneath, as it is observed for water drops on a heated plate, kept aloft by a stream of water vapor. We investigate the limit of small flow rates, for which the size of the gap between the drop and the substrate becomes very small. Above a critical drop radius no stationary drops can exist, below the critical radius two solutions coexist. However, only the solution with the smaller gap width is stable, the other is unstable. We compare to experimental data and use boundary integral simulations to show that unstable drops develop a gas ""chimney"" which breaks the drop in its middle."
D1-2141	 Harnessing the power of solar energy, we've developed sophisticated photovoltaic cells that can convert sunlight into electricity efficiently. These cells, composed of semiconducting materials like silicon, function by allowing photons to knock electrons free, creating an electric current. Advancements in nanotechnology have led to the creation of perovskite solar cells, offering higher efficiency and lower production costs compared to traditional silicon cells. Despite these strides, challenges remain, such as the need for improved durability and stability under varying environmental conditions. Continued research in materials science and photovoltaic technology promises a future where renewable solar energy becomes an even more integral part of our global energy landscape.
D1-2142	The scaling properties of oil price fluctuations are described as a non-stationary stochastic process realized by a time series of finite length. An original model is used to extract the scaling exponent of the fluctuation functions within a non-stationary process formulation. It is shown that, when returns are measured over intervals less than 10 days, the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) exhibit self-similarity and monoscaling, in contrast to the multifractal behavior of the PDFs at macro-scales (typically larger than one month). We find that the time evolution of the distributions are well fitted by a Levy distribution law at micro-scales. The relevance of a Levy distribution is made plausible by a simple model of nonlinear transfer
D1-2143	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This principle, counterintuitive in classical physics, is exemplified by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Here, a cat could theoretically be both alive and dead until the box is opened, reflecting the wave function's ability to encompass all possible outcomes before measurement. This paradoxical behavior challenges our understanding of reality, underscoring the profound differences between quantum and classical physics.
D1-2144	A comparison is made of the traditional Loschmidt (reversibility) and Zermelo (recurrence) objections to Boltzmann's H-theorem, and its simplified variant in the Ehrenfests' 1912 wind-tree model. The little-cited 1896 (pre-recurrence) objection of Zermelo (similar to an 1889 argument due to Poincare) is also analysed. Significant differences between the objections are highlighted, and several old and modern misconceptions concerning both them and the H-theorem are clarified. We give particular emphasis to the radical nature of Poincare's and Zermelo's attack, and the importance of the shift in Boltzmann's thinking in response to the objections as a whole.
D1-2145	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition captures the enigmatic nature of microscopic particles. Superposition posits that a single particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude and probability. This phenomenon is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed, echoing the uncertainty principle that limits our ability to know the exact state of a system. The superposition principle challenges classical notions of reality and highlights the profound differences between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.
D1-2146	We show conditions for HFGW detection, employing an entropy concept written up by Jack Ng, and Steinhard's proceedure for reconstructing tensorial representations for relic HFGW from the onset of the big bang. The issue of the reality of gravitons as a measurable physical object which was raised by Rothman in 2006 is indirectly answered via a proceedure obtained from Weinberg's 1972 book on gravitation, and all the methodologies so obtained are referenced with respect to engineering specifications of the Li-Baker HFGW detector. In addition, the document also refers to entanglement entropy, and its possible aid in refining measurement predictions. Finally, commentary about HFGW and relic neutrino physics data sets is included, with regards to inflationary model candidates
D1-2147	 Harnessing the boundless energy of the cosmos, scientists are meticulously crafting a new generation of solar panels. These advanced innovations, known as perovskite solar cells, are set to revolutionize the renewable energy sector. With a composition similar to common table salt, these cells have a unique ability to efficiently absorb sunlight, converting it into electricity with impressive efficiency levels. Despite their recent inception, perovskite solar cells already exhibit performance comparable to traditional silicon-based panels, offering a promising path towards sustainable and cost-effective energy production. As research progresses, we can envision a future where these groundbreaking solar cells power our homes, cities, and even electric vehicles, propelling us towards a cleaner, greener planet.
D1-2148	Voltage-gated ion channels are key molecules for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cell membranes. The voltage-dependent switching of these channels between conducting and nonconducting states is a major factor in controlling the transmembrane voltage. In this study, a statistical mechanics model of these molecules has been discussed on the basis of a two-dimensional spin model. A new Hamiltonian and a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm are introduced to simulate such a model. It was shown that the results well match the experimental data obtained from batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels in the squid giant axon using the cut-open axon technique.
D1-2149	 Embracing the cosmic dance, we delve into the captivating realm of celestial bodies. The celestial sphere, a historical representation of the universe, is replaced by the vast, ever-expanding cosmos, a testament to the relentless expansion of the universe. This cosmic expansion is fueled by dark energy, a mysterious force that accounts for 70% of the universe's composition, a conundrum that leaves physicists in awe. Meanwhile, dark matter, an invisible substance comprising approximately 27% of the universe, remains elusive, its existence inferred only through its gravitational influence. The remaining 3% is familiar territory, consisting of atoms and subatomic particles, the building blocks of everything we know. This cosmic ballet, a harmonious blend of the known and the unknown, continues to unfold, promising endless fascination for the inquisitive mind.
D1-2150	We report an experimental study of liquid drops moving against gravity, when placed on a vertically vibrating inclined plate, which is partially wetted by the drop. The frequency of vibrations ranges from 30 to 200 Hz, and, above a threshold in vibration acceleration, drops experience an upward motion. We attribute this surprising motion to the deformations of the drop, as a consequence of an up or down symmetry breaking induced by the presence of the substrate. We relate the direction of motion to contact angle measurements. This phenomenon can be used to move a drop along an arbitrary path in a plane, without special surface treatments or localized forcing.
D1-2151	 Harnessing the power of quantum entanglement, physicists have devised an intricate network of quantum bits, or qubits, to create a quantum internet. This internet, unlike its classical counterpart, operates on the principles of superposition and entanglement, enabling unprecedented levels of security and data transmission speed. The potential applications are vast, from secure global communications to ultra-fast quantum computing, revolutionizing various sectors, particularly finance, healthcare, and research. However, with this technological leap, we must also grapple with the challenges of maintaining quantum coherence over long distances and developing error-correcting protocols to mitigate data loss. The road ahead is fraught with complexities, but the promise of a quantum internet is undeniably transformative, ushering us into a new era of connectivity and innovation.
D1-2152	We study the properties of a capacitive 13.56 MHz discharge properties with a mixture of Ar/C2H2 taking into account the plasmochemistry and growth of heavy hydrocarbons. A hybrid model was developed to combine the kinetic description for electron motion and the fluid approach for negative and positive ions transport and plasmochemical processes. A significant change of plasma parameters related to injection of 5.8% portion of acetylene in argon was observed and analyzed. We found that the electronegativity of the mixture is about 30%. The densities of negatively and positively charged heavy hydrocarbons are sufficiently large to be precursors for the formation of nanoparticles in the discharge volume.
D1-2153	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconducting materials. These systems have gained significant popularity due to their renewable, clean, and virtually maintenance-free nature. The efficiency of solar PV technology continues to improve, with advancements in materials science and cell design. For instance, perovskite solar cells, a relatively new type of PV cell, have shown promising efficiencies that are rapidly approaching those of traditional silicon-based cells. As we strive for a sustainable future, the continued development and integration of solar PV technology into our energy infrastructure will play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable, secure energy supply.
D1-2154	In this work we present a general mechanism by which simple dynamics running on networks become self-organized critical for scale free topologies. We illustrate this mechanism with a simple arithmetic model of division between integers, the division model. This is the simplest self-organized critical model advanced so far, and in this sense it may help to elucidate the mechanism of self-organization to criticality. Its simplicity allows analytical tractability, characterizing several scaling relations. Furthermore, its mathematical nature brings about interesting connections between statistical physics and number theoretical concepts. We show how this model can be understood as a self-organized stochastic process embedded on a network, where the onset of criticality is induced by the topology.
D1-2155	 In the realm of quantum physics, the wave-particle duality principle postulates that every particle exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. This apparent contradiction, demonstrated through experiments like the double-slit experiment, challenges our classical understanding of reality. The wave-like behavior, characterized by interference patterns, suggests particles can exist in multiple places simultaneously until observed. Conversely, the particle-like behavior, marked by discrete, localized events, implies particles have definite positions. This inherent uncertainty, encapsulated in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, underlines the profound mystery that quantum physics continues to unravel, offering a glimpse into the enigmatic, subatomic world.
D1-2156	During fast locomotion - gallop, half bound - of quadruped mammals, the ground contact of the limbs in each pair do not alternate symmetrically. Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference. Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia, Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.
D1-2157	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies classical logic. The wave-particle duality principle postulates that every particle can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. For instance, light, traditionally considered a wave, can behave as particles known as photons when passing through a double-slit experiment. Conversely, electrons, usually perceived as particles, can manifest as waves when diffracted by a crystal lattice. This profound paradox, challenging our intuitive understanding, underscores the intricate dance of the microscopic world, where particles seem to teleport, entangle, and exist in multiple states simultaneously, blurring the lines between presence and absence.
D1-2158	The most costly and annoying characteristic of the e-mail communication system is the large number of unsolicited commercial e-mails, known as spams, that are continuously received. Via the investigation of the statistical properties of the spam delivering intertimes, we show that spams delivered to a given recipient are time correlated: if the intertime between two consecutive spams is small (large), then the next spam will most probably arrive after a small (large) intertime. Spam temporal correlations are reproduced by a numerical model based on the random superposition of spam sequences, each one described by the Omori law. This and other experimental findings suggest that statistical approaches may be used to infer how spammers operate.
D1-2159	" In the realm of quantum physics, the principle of superposition posits that any two (or more) quantum states can be added together, or ""superposed,"" and the system will exist in all possible states at once. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in classical physics, is exemplified by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat trapped in a box with a radioactive atom and a poison is both alive and dead until the box is opened, collapsing the superposition to one state. The mystery of superposition, coupled with entanglement, forms the bedrock of quantum mechanics, challenging our understanding of reality and opening doors to the study of quantum computing."
D1-2160	L-shape probability distributions are extremely non-Gaussian distributions that have been surprisingly successful in describing the frequency of occurrence of extreme events, ranging from stock market crashes and natural disasters, the structure of biological systems, fractals, and optical rogue waves. In this paper, we show that fluctuations in stimulated Raman scattering in silicon, as well as in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, can follow extreme value statistics and provide mathematical insight into the origin of this behavior. As an example of the experimental observations, we find that 16% of the Stokes pulses account for 84% of the pump energy transfer, an uncanny resemblance to the empirical Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule that describes important observation in socioeconomics.
D1-2161	 In the realm of quantum physics, the curious phenomenon of superposition unfolds. This theory suggests that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated probability. Until observed, these states remain in a state of superposition, a delicate dance of probabilities. The measurement, or act of observation, forces the particle to collapse into one definite state, shattering the delicate balance. This enigmatic behavior challenges our classical understanding of reality, where objects exist in a single, definite state at any given moment. In the quantum world, the very act of observation shapes the outcome, underscoring the profound interplay between observer and observed.
D1-2162	We study the robustness of complex networks subject to edge removal. Several network models and removing strategies are simulated. Rather than the existence of the giant component, we use total connectedness as the criterion of breakdown. The network topologies are introduced a simple traffic dynamics and the total connectedness is interpreted not only in the sense of topology but also in the sense of function. We define the topological robustness and the functional robustness, investigate their combined effect and compare their relative importance to each other. The results of our study provide an alternative view of the overall robustness and highlight efficient ways to improve the robustness of the network models.
D1-2163	 Harnessing the power of solar energy is a contemporary pursuit that propels our civilization towards a sustainable future. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, converting sunlight directly into electricity, have become increasingly efficient. The advent of perovskite solar cells, boasting high power conversion efficiencies, offers a promising avenue for further advancements. These cells, made from a combination of organic and inorganic materials, could potentially reduce production costs and bolster the widespread adoption of solar energy. However, challenges remain, such as stability and toxicity concerns. Ongoing research focuses on addressing these issues and optimizing performance to ensure solar power becomes a reliable, cost-effective, and accessible source of energy for all.
D1-2164	The tragedy of the digital commons does not prevent the copious voluntary production of content that one witnesses in the web. We show through an analysis of a massive data set from \texttt{YouTube} that the productivity exhibited in crowdsourcing exhibits a strong positive dependence on attention, measured by the number of downloads. Conversely, a lack of attention leads to a decrease in the number of videos uploaded and the consequent drop in productivity, which in many cases asymptotes to no uploads whatsoever. Moreover, uploaders compare themselves to others when having low productivity and to themselves when exceeding a threshold.
D1-2165	 Harnessing the power of solar energy has surged in recent years, driven by advances in photovoltaic technology. Solar panels, composed of silicon cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity. This renewable energy source is not only environmentally friendly but also infinite, unlike fossil fuels. As the cost of solar panel production decreases, we are witnessing a global shift towards solar power. This transition not only addresses our growing energy demands but also mitigates the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. The future of solar energy promises a cleaner, sustainable world, where the sun's rays replace our reliance on polluting energy sources.
D1-2166	The nanoscale fluctuation dynamics of semi dilute high molecular weight polymer solutions of Polyethylenoxide (PEO) in D2O under non-equilibrium flow conditions were studied by the neutron spin-echo technique. The sample cell was in contraction flow geometry and provided a pressure driven flow with a high elongational component that stretched the polymers most efficiently. The experiments suggest that the mobility on the scale of a few monomers, comparable to the Kuhn segment length, becomes highly anisotropic and is enhanced perpendicular to the flow direction. Diffraction data show a weak structural correlation along the chains on a length scale of about 17 Angstroems, which might be related to the Kuhn length in this system.
D1-2167	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles defies our classical understanding. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this, revealing that particles can exist as both a particle and a wave, exhibiting a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. This paradoxical behavior challenges our intuition, suggesting a fundamental interplay between particles and their environment, as well as the potential for non-local connections between distant particles. Despite its enigmatic nature, this quantum realm underpins our entire universe, governing the interactions of all matter and energy.
D1-2168	We use Bloch oscillations to transfer coherently many photon momenta to atoms. Then we can measure accurately the ratio h/m_Rb and deduce the fine structure constant alpha. The velocity variation due to the Bloch oscillations is measured thanks to Raman transitions. In a first experiment, two Raman $\pi$ pulses are used to select and measure a very narrow velocity class. This method yields to a value of the fine structure constant alpha^{-1}= 137.035 998 84 (91) with a relative uncertainty of about 6.6 ppb. More recently we use an atomic interferometer consisting in two pairs of pi/2 pulses. We present here the first results obtained with this method.
D1-2169	 Harnessing the power of renewable energy, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems transform sunlight directly into electricity. This clean and sustainable energy source relies on semiconducting materials, primarily silicon, which absorb photons from the sun. Electrons, liberated by the photon's energy, flow through the circuit, generating a current. The efficiency of these systems is improved by advanced technologies such as concentrator photovoltaics, which focus sunlight onto smaller, more efficient cells, and perovskite solar cells, a promising, cost-effective alternative to traditional silicon solar panels. As research progresses, the potential for solar PV to meet global energy demands and mitigate climate change continues to grow, illuminating a bright future for renewable energy.

The manuscript includes a general introduction, the first chapter contains bibliographic review, the second chapter described the fundamentals of conductometric transducers, the third chapter examining the possibility to create and to optimize conductometric biosensor based on bovine alkaline phosphatase for heavy metals ions detection, the fourth chapter devoted to creation and optimization of conductometric biosensor based on alkaline phosphatase active microalgae and sol gel technology, the last chapter described application of the proposed algal biosensor for measurements of heavy metal ions toxicity of waste water, general conclusions stating the progresses achieved in the field of environmental monitoring
D1-2171	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, particles don't strictly follow the classical laws of physics. Instead, they exhibit a behavior known as superposition. This means a single particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, until it is observed. The act of observation forces a 'collapse' of the superposition, determining its single, definite state. This phenomenon challenges our understanding of reality, blurring the line between probability and certainty. It's a testament to the profound mysteries that continue to unfold in the world of physics.
D1-2172	We theoretically investigate the properties of crossing for two perpendicular subwavelength plasmonic slot waveguides. We show that, when encountering nano intersection, the crosstalk for the direct crossing is around 25%, almost same as throughout. In terms of symmetry considerations and resonant-tunnelling effect, we design compact cavity-based structures. Our results show that the crosstalk is eliminated and the throughput reaches the unity on resonance. Simulations results are in agreement with those from the coupled-model theory. When taking into account of the material loss, due to the unchanged symmetry properties of the modes, the crosstalk is still suppressed. Our results may open a way to construct nanoscale crossings for high-density nanoplasmonic integration circuits.
D1-2173	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental pillar, governs the time evolution of a quantum system's wave function. This differential equation, formulated by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926, encapsulates the principles of superposition and wave-particle duality. The solution to this equation provides the probability distribution of observing a particle in a specific location at a certain time. The Schrödinger equation's intricacies have led to many paradoxes and thought experiments, such as Schrödinger's cat, challenging our classical understanding of reality and paving the way for the development of quantum computers and quantum information science.
D1-2174	We report on a novel optofluidic system consisting of a silica-based 1D photonic crystal, integrated planar waveguides and electrically insulated fluidic channels. An array of pillars in a microfluidic channel designed for electrochromatography is used as a resonator for on-column label-free refractive index detection. The resonator was fabricated in a silicon oxynitride platform, to support electroosmotic flow, and operated at 1.55 microns. Different aqueous solutions of ethanol with refractive indices ranging from n = 1.3330 to 1.3616 were pumped into the column/resonator and the transmission spectra were recorded. Linear shifts of the resonant wavelengths yielded a maximum sensitivity of 480 nm/RIU and a minimum difference of 0.007 RIU was measured.
D1-2175	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the fascinating duality of particles unfolds. Photons, packets of light, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. This enigma challenges our classical understanding as a particle seemingly travels in multiple places at once, much like a wave. This profound concept is further illustrated by the double-slit experiment, where individual photons, when passed through two slits, create an interference pattern upon a screen, as if they've passed through both slits simultaneously. This phenomenon, deeply rooted in the quantum world, defies our intuition of particles as discrete entities and underscores the intricate dance of probability in the subatomic realm.
D1-2176	One of the key socioeconomic phenomena to explain is the distribution of wealth. Bouchaud and M\'ezard have proposed an interesting model of economy [Bouchaud and M\'ezard (2000)] based on trade and investments of agents. In the mean-field approximation, the model produces a stationary wealth distribution with a power-law tail. In this paper we examine characteristic time scales of the model and show that for any finite number of agents, the validity of the mean-field result is time-limited and the model in fact has no stationary wealth distribution. Further analysis suggests that for heterogeneous agents, the limitations are even stronger. We conclude with general implications of the presented results.
D1-2177	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar panels convert photons from sunlight into electrical energy, a clean and renewable source. This process, known as the photovoltaic effect, relies on semiconductors, primarily silicon, which absorb and release electrons when struck by photons. The resulting electric charge is collected, amplified, and converted into usable electricity. Solar energy offers a promising solution to mitigate energy crises, reduce carbon emissions, and foster sustainable development, making it a vital component in the global transition towards a greener future.
D1-2178	"We calculated the Fresnel paraxial propagator in a birefringent plate having topological charge $q$ at its center, named ""$q$-plate"". We studied the change of the beam transverse profile when it traverses the plate. An analytical closed form of the beam profile propagating in the ""$q$-plate"" can be found for many important specific input beam profiles. We paid particular attention to the plate having a topological unit charge and we found that if small losses due to reflection, absorption and scattering are neglected, the plate can convert the photon spin into orbital angular momentum with up to 100% efficiency, provided the thickness of the plate is less than the Rayleigh range of the incident beam."
D1-2179	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, superposition stands as a fascinating phenomenon. It postulates that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated probability amplitude. For instance, a photon, in its superposed state, could be both a particle and a wave. This counterintuitive concept challenges our classical understanding of reality, where an object can only occupy one state at a time. Measurement, however, collapses the superposition, revealing a single state. Thus, the enigmatic dance of quantum superposition encapsulates the intriguing duality inherent in the subatomic world, forever entwining the realms of the particle and the wave.
D1-2180	Volumes of sub-wavelength electromagnetic elements can act like homogeneous materials: metamaterials. In analogy, sheets of optical elements such as prisms can act ray-optically like homogeneous sheet materials. In this sense, such sheets can be considered to be metamaterials for light rays (METATOYs). METATOYs realize new and unusual transformations of the directions of transmitted light rays. We study here, in the ray-optics and scalar-wave limits, the wave-optical analog of such transformations, and we show that such an analog does not always exist. Perhaps, this is the reason why many of the ray-optical possibilities offered by METATOYs have never before been considered.
D1-2181	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the fascinating phenomenon of superposition unfolds. This principle suggests that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated probability amplitude. Until observed, these states remain indistinguishable, forming a delicate dance of potentialities. Once measured, the superposition collapses, revealing a single, definitive state. This enigmatic behavior challenges our classical understanding of reality and underscores the profound mysteries that permeate the subatomic world.
D1-2182	A magnetometer using spin-polarized K and $^3$He atoms occupying the same volume is used to search for anomalous nuclear spin-dependent forces generated by a separate $^3$He spin source. We measure changes in the $^3$He spin precession frequency with a resolution of 18 pHz and constrain anomalous spin forces between neutrons to be less than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ of their magnetic or less than $2\times 10^{-3}$ of their gravitational interactions on a length scale of 50 cm. We present new limits on neutron coupling to light pseudoscalar and vector particles, including torsion, and constraints on recently proposed models involving unparticles and spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
D1-2183	 Harnessing the power of the wind is a prime example of human ingenuity meeting nature's force. Wind turbines, standing tall like sentinels, convert wind energy into electricity. The rotating blades capture the wind's kinetic energy, which is then transferred to the turbine's shaft. This mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by the generator within, powering homes and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Wind energy is renewable, clean, and sustainable, making it a crucial component in the fight against climate change. As technology advances, wind energy efficiency improves, and future innovations promise a brighter, greener world.
D1-2184	Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) transition probabilities are reported for transitions between levels of 3d^5 in [Fe IV]. The accuracy of the ab initio energy levels and the agreement in the length and velocity forms of the line strength for the E2 transitions are used as indicators of accuracy. The present E2 and M1 transition probabilities are compared with earlier Breit-Pauli results and other theories. An extensive set of transition probabilites with indicators of accuracy are reported in Appendices A and B. Recommended values of A(E2) + A(M1) are listed in Appendix C.
D1-2185	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds: superposition. It's a state where a particle can be in multiple places simultaneously, existing as a probabilistic sum of its individual states. This concept challenges our classical understanding, as particles don't follow the rules of everyday reality. Instead, they behave in ways that seem almost magical, with outcomes determined by wave functions and probabilities. Superposition is not just theoretical. it has been experimentally verified, demonstrating the unique and puzzling nature of the quantum world. This principle, while counterintuitive, offers a glimpse into the mysterious workings of the subatomic realm, where the ordinary laws of physics cease to apply.
D1-2186	Using a non-selective broadband detection scheme we discovered an efficient mechanism of formation of ultracold Cs$_2$ molecules in deeply bound levels ($v=1-9$) of their electronic ground state X$^1 \Sigma_g^+$. They are formed by a one-photon photoassociation of ultracold cesium atoms in a manifold of excited electronic states, followed by a two-step spontaneous emission cascade. We were able to form about $10^5-10^6$ molecules per second in these low vibrational levels of the ground state. This detection scheme could be generalized to other molecular species for the systematic investigation of cold molecule formation mechanisms.
D1-2187	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition is profoundly fascinating. It posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude and probability. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in the macroscopic world, is exemplified by Schrödinger's famous cat thought experiment. Here, a cat is both alive and dead until observed, existing in a superposition of states. This mysterious principle, challenging our classical understanding, underpins the enigmatic dance of particles at the nucleus of atoms and the intricate tapestry of the universe at its most fundamental level.
D1-2188	We study the dynamics of the adoption of new products by agents with continuous opinions and discrete actions (CODA). The model is such that the refusal in adopting a new idea or product is increasingly weighted by neighbor agents as evidence against the product. Under these rules, we study the distribution of adoption times and the final proportion of adopters in the population. We compare the cases where initial adopters are clustered to the case where they are randomly scattered around the social network and investigate small world effects on the final proportion of adopters. The model predicts a fat tailed distribution for late adopters which is verified by empirical data.
D1-2189	 Harnessing the power of the sun has been a long-standing goal in physics. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, a key technology, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are made primarily of silicon, which, despite being abundant, requires significant energy for extraction and purification. To address this, researchers are exploring alternative materials, such as perovskites, that offer promising efficiencies while requiring less energy-intensive production. Additionally, advancements in concentrator solar power systems, which focus sunlight onto a small area using mirrors or lenses, are increasing the efficiency of thermal energy conversion, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation. As these technologies improve and costs decrease, solar power is poised to become a dominant source of renewable energy.
D1-2190	We have employed the relativistic coupled-cluster theory to calculate the electric dipole matrix elements in the singly ionized barium (Ba$^+$) and radium (Ra$^+$). Matrix elements of Ba$^+$ are used to determine the light-shift ratios for two different wavelengths on which recent experiments are carried out. By combining the measured light-shift ratios and our calculations, we are able to estimate possible errors associate with the used matrix elements in Ba$^+$. Static polarizabilities of the low-lying states and lifetimes of the first excited P-states are also determined using these matrix elements in Ba$^+$. A similar approach has been followed to estimate the lifetimes and light-shift ratios in Ra$^+$.
D1-2191	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental mathematical description of a quantum system, governs the time evolution of a quantum state. This equation, derived by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926, is a wave equation that can be solved for systems with a small number of particles. It provides the wave function, a complex-valued probability amplitude, that offers insight into the probabilities of finding a particle at a specific location or in a specific state at a given time. The square of the absolute value of the wave function represents the probability density, establishing the wave-particle duality central to quantum physics.
D1-2192	The paper discusses impact of the velocity curl on some conservation laws in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field, by means of the characteristics of quaternions. When the velocity curl can not be neglected, it will cause the predictions to departure slightly from the conservation laws, which include mass continuity equation, charge continuity equation, and conservation of spin, etc. And the scalar potential of gravitational field has an effect on the speed of light, the conservation of mass, and conservation of charge, etc. The results explain how the velocity curl influences some conservation laws in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field.
D1-2193	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment showcases the enigmatic nature of particles. When photons or electrons are fired at a screen with two narrow slits, they seemingly pass through both simultaneously, creating an interference pattern on a detection screen behind. This phenomenon, known as quantum superposition, defies classical understanding, suggesting that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, a concept coined as 'wave-particle duality.' This experiment challenges our intuition and fundamentally alters our perception of reality, pushing the boundaries of our understanding in the microscopic world.
D1-2194	A summary of the relationship between the Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equation (FPKfe) and the Feynman path integral descriptions of stochastic processes relevant for the solution of the continuous-discrete filtering problem is provided in this paper. The practical utility of the path integral formula is demonstrated via some nontrivial examples. Specifically, it is shown that the simplest approximation of the path integral formula for the fundamental solution of the FPKfe can be applied to solve nonlinear continuous-discrete filtering problems quite accurately. The Dirac-Feynman path integral filtering algorithm is quite simple, and is suitable for real-time implementation.
D1-2195	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a specific probability. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in classical physics, is vividly illustrated by Schrödinger's thought experiment involving a cat. Here, a cat's life and death states coexist until an observation is made, collapsing the superposition and revealing the actual state. This principle challenges our conventional understanding of reality and continues to fascinate physicists and philosophers alike, blurring the boundaries between the observable and the unobservable.
D1-2196	Rates of depopulation by blackbody radiation (BBR) and effective lifetimes of alkali-metal \textit{nS}, \textit{n}P and \textit{nD} Rydberg states have been calculated in a wide range of principal quantum numbers $n \le 80$ at the ambient temperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K. Quasiclassical formulas were used to calculate the radial matrix elements of the dipole transitions from Rydberg states. Good agreement of our numerical results with the available theoretical and experimental data has been found. We have also obtained simple analytical formulas for estimates of effective lifetimes and BBR-induced depopulation rates, which well agree with the numerical data.
D1-2197	 Harnessing the power of the sun has become a significant focus in modern physics. Solar energy, a renewable and abundant source, is increasingly being utilized to meet global energy demands. Photovoltaic cells, a crucial technology, convert sunlight directly into electricity. Efficiency in these cells is constantly being improved, with advancements in materials like perovskites and quantum dots promising greater energy yields. Furthermore, solar thermal energy, which uses sunlight to heat a fluid, can drive turbines and generate electricity. As we continue to refine these technologies, solar energy is poised to play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future.
D1-2198	We study a spatial Prisoner's dilemma game with two types (A and B) of players located on a square lattice. Players following either cooperator or defector strategies play Prisoner's Dilemma games with their 24 nearest neighbors. The players are allowed to adopt one of their neighbor's strategy with a probability dependent on the payoff difference and type of the given neighbor. Players A and B have different efficiency in the transfer of their own strategy therefore the strategy adoption probability is reduced by a multiplicative factor (w < 1) from the players of type B. We report that the motion of the influential payers (type A) can improve remarkably the maintenance of cooperation even for their low densities.
D1-2199	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are primarily composed of silicon, a semiconductor material. When sunlight strikes the PV cell, it creates electron-photon interactions, causing electrons to be freed from their atomic bonds. This generates a flow of electric current, which can be harnessed and utilized for various purposes. The efficiency of solar PV cells varies, with the best ones achieving around 25% conversion rate from sunlight to electricity. With ongoing research and technological advancements, the aim is to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of solar energy, making it a more viable and sustainable power source for our future.
D1-2200	The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will carry out a systematic investigation of ionization cooling of a muon beam. As the emittance measurement will be done on a particle-by-particle basis, sophisticated beam instrumentation is needed to measure particle coordinates and timing vs RF. A PID system based on three time-of-flight stations, two Aerogel Cerenkov detectors and a KLOE-like calorimeter has been constructed in order to keep beam contamination ($e, \pi$) well below 1%. The MICE time-of-flight system will measure timing with a resolution better than 70 ps per plane, in a harsh environment due to high particle rates, fringe magnetic fields and electron backgrounds from RF dark current.
D1-2201	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Heisenberg, underscores the intrinsic limitation in our ability to precisely measure two complementary properties of a particle, such as position and momentum. This principle, encapsulated in the equation Δx Δp ≥ h/4π, where Δx and Δp denote the uncertainties in position and momentum, respectively, and h is Planck's constant, challenges classical notions of certainty and predictability, thereby leading to a profound reshaping of our understanding of the nature of reality.
D1-2202	We propose a new formulation of the probability distribution function of wind driven water surface slope with an $\alpha$-stable distribution probability. The mathematical formulation of the probability distribution function is given under an integral formulation. Application to represent the probability of time slope data from laboratory experiments is carried out with satisfactory results. We compare also the $\alpha$-stable model of the water surface slopes with the Gram-Charlier development and the non-Gaussian model of Liu et alLiu. Discussions and conclusions are conducted on the basis of the data fit results and the model analysis comparison.
D1-2203	 In the realm of quantum physics, a fascinating phenomenon called quantum entanglement emerges. It's a strong correlation between particles, no matter how far apart they are. This means that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, even if they're light-years apart. This instantaneous connection defies classical physics' causality and has led to intriguing debates about the nature of reality itself. The entangled particles share a single quantum state, a concept that challenges our understanding of the universe, blurring the line between space and time. This mystery, yet to be fully unraveled, underscores the profound depth and complexity of the quantum world.
D1-2204	The optical birefringence of rod-like nematogens (7CB, 8CB), imbibed in parallel silica channels with 10 nm diameter and 300 micrometer length, is measured and compared to the thermotropic bulk behavior. The orientational order of the confined liquid crystals, quantified by the uniaxial nematic ordering parameter, evolves continuously between paranematic and nematic states, in contrast to the discontinuous isotropic-to-nematic bulk phase transitions. A Landau-de Gennes model reveals that the strength of the orientational ordering fields, imposed by the silica walls, is beyond a critical threshold, that separates discontinuous from continuous paranematic-to-nematic behavior. Quenched disorder effects, attributable to wall irregularities, leave the transition temperatures affected only marginally, despite the strong ordering fields in the channels.
D1-2205	 Harnessing the power of the sun through solar energy is a promising avenue in our quest for renewable and sustainable sources. Solar panels, made primarily of silicon, convert sunlight directly into electricity, providing a steady, clean energy supply. The efficiency of these panels continues to improve, with recent advancements in perovskite solar cells promising an efficiency increase beyond traditional silicon-based ones. Additionally, the integration of energy storage systems, such as batteries, enables the use of solar energy during non-daylight hours, making solar energy a viable solution for round-the-clock power needs. This transition towards solar energy can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a greener, more sustainable future.
D1-2206	In this paper we report a spectrometric approach to dual-energy digital radiography that has been developed and applied to identify specific organic substances and discern small differences in their effective atomic number. An experimental setup has been designed, and a theoretical description proposed based on the experimental results obtained. The proposed method is based on application of special reference samples made of materials with different effective atomic number and thickness, parameters known to affect X-ray attenuation in the low-energy range. The results obtained can be used in the development of a new generation of multi-energy customs or medical X-ray scanners.
D1-2207	 Delving into the realm of quantum mechanics, we find the fascinating concept of superposition. This principle suggests that a quantum particle, such as an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. It's as if the electron is both spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time, a phenomenon defying our everyday intuition. This intriguing property, once observed, collapses into a single state, highlighting the profound difference between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. The enigma of superposition challenges our understanding of reality, blurring the lines between the possible and the impossible.
D1-2208	The muon spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment is one of the largest detectors ever built. At the LHC, new physics signs could appear through high momentun muons (1 TeV). Identification and precise momentum measurement of such muons are two of the main challenges of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. In order to get a good resolution for high energy muons (i.e. 10% at 1 TeV), the accuracy on the alignment of precision chambers must be of the order of 50 microns. Several procedures have been developed to reach such a precision. This document describes complementary techniques used to align the muon sub-detectors, and their results : the optical system, the muon cosmic rays and the straight tracks coming from collisions.
D1-2209	 Harnessing the power of the sun through solar energy is an increasingly relevant solution in our quest for sustainable energy sources. Solar panels, made primarily of silicon, convert sunlight into electricity. This electricity can power homes, businesses, and even electric vehicles, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. The increasing efficiency of solar panels, coupled with the decreasing costs, makes solar energy a viable and cost-effective option for many. Moreover, solar energy is renewable, clean, and virtually inexhaustible, making it a promising long-term solution for our energy needs. As technology continues to advance, we can expect solar energy to play an increasingly significant role in our global energy landscape.
D1-2210	The underlying mechanism of the stationary light pulse (SLP) was identified as a band gap being created by a Bragg grating formed by two counter-propagating coupling fields of similar wavelength. Here we present a more general view of the formation of SLPs, namely several balanced four-wave mixing processes sharing the same ground-state coherence. Utilizing this new concept we report the first experimental observation of a bichromatic SLP at wavelengths for which no Bragg grating can be established. We also demonstrate the production of a SLP directly from a propagating light pulse without prior storage. Being easily controlled externally makes SLPs a very versatile tool for low-light-level nonlinear optics and quantum information manipulation.
D1-2211	 In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of superposition captivates the imagination. It posits that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This phenomenon, defying classical logic, is encapsulated in Schrödinger's famous thought experiment involving a cat. Until the box is opened, the cat is both alive and dead, existing in a state of superposition. This counterintuitive concept challenges our understanding of reality and has profound implications for our perception of the physical world.
D1-2212	In the CF-LERN field (Cold Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear reactions) many experimental results are available: unexplained energy production, presence of unusual patterns of classical fusion reaction products, isotopic composition variations, sporadic emission of nuclear radiations. These effects are not always observed, for similar experimental conditions. Should a fundamental reason exist for these effects to occur, funding would be justified, to make them repeatable and more intense (this step being likely to be a trial and error process, might require a substantial amount of money). In this article, a possible fundamental explanation of the phenomenon is described, together with the experimental plan to assess it.
D1-2213	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a fundamental concept is the wave-particle duality. This principle posits that every particle exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, a seemingly paradoxical phenomenon. For instance, light can behave as a particle, known as a photon, yet also as a wave, causing interference patterns. Similarly, electrons, considered particles, can manifest as waves, forming diffraction patterns around barriers. This duality challenges our classical understanding of matter and energy, highlighting the unique and intricate nature of the quantum world.
D1-2214	In the Dimension Embedded in Unified Symmetry (Adrian Sabin Popescu, D.E.U.S. (Dimension Embedded in Unified Symmetry), p. 221-247, Ed. Cartea Universitara, Bucuresti, ISBN 978-973-731-519-9 (arXiv:0704.2670) (2007)) book we made a qualitative description of the way in which we can construct the Large Scale Structure of the Universe from the knot-particle equivalence. Even that we are limited by the lack of computational power implemented on a nonlinear computational architecture needed to conduct this study to its finish, we are still able to give the algorithm to be used in a future simulation, on a, let say, quantum computer.
D1-2215	 Harnessing the power of solar energy has emerged as a promising solution for our planet's energy needs. Photovoltaic cells, the heart of solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are made from silicon, a relatively abundant element, and their efficiency continues to improve, thanks to advancements in nanotechnology and materials science. With this technology, we can generate clean, renewable energy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating the harmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, solar energy systems have become increasingly affordable and accessible, empowering homeowners, businesses, and entire communities to produce their own electricity. The future of solar power is bright indeed, offering a sustainable pathway towards a cleaner, greener planet.
D1-2216	Main aim of this topical issue is to report recent advances in noisy nonequilibrium processes useful to describe the dynamics of ecological systems and to address the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in ecology both from the experimental and theoretical points of view. This is in order to understand the dynamical behaviour of ecological complex systems through the interplay between nonlinearity, noise, random and periodic environmental interactions. Discovering the microscopic rules and the local interactions which lead to the emergence of specific global patterns or global dynamical behaviour and the noises role in the nonlinear dynamics is an important, key aspect to understand and then to model ecological complex systems.
D1-2217	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental cornerstone, elegantly encapsulates the dynamic behavior of quantum systems. This complex differential equation, formulated by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, describes the time evolution of a quantum state, thus illuminating the probability distribution of finding a particle at a specific location within a given space. However, the equation's solutions, represented by wave functions, remain abstract and require interpretation through the Copenhagen interpretation or other interpretations to reveal the seemingly paradoxical realm of quantum reality.
D1-2218	Studies are cited indicating that gravitino production acts as a natural upper bound to Li6 and Li7 levels, based on what happens after hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 s. after the Big Bang. The produced gravitinos contribute a large fraction of required dark matter density. Whether or not gravitinos can be linked to neutrino production depends on which model of dark matter (DM) is assumed or used. A model presented by the author in 2008 links DM of about 100 GeV -- based on a phenomenological Lagrangian creating different Neutrino masses without SUSY -- with a dark matter candidate of about 100 GeV. This may tie in 100 GeV gravitinos with neutrino physics.
D1-2219	 Harnessing the power of solar energy is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight directly into electricity, making them an efficient and clean source of power. The cost of solar PV technology has significantly decreased in recent years, making it increasingly accessible for both residential and commercial applications. However, the intermittent nature of solar power requires effective energy storage solutions, such as batteries, to ensure a consistent supply. Moreover, advancements in concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies, which use mirrors to focus sunlight on a single point, promise higher efficiency and greater capacity. As we continue to address these challenges, solar energy will undoubtedly play a crucial role in our transition towards a more sustainable and energy-independent future.
D1-2220	We study a simple reaction-diffusion population model [proposed by A. Windus and H. J. Jensen, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 2287 (2007)] on scale-free networks. In the case of fully random diffusion, the network topology cannot affect the critical death rate, whereas the heterogeneous connectivity can cause smaller steady population density and critical population density. In the case of modified diffusion, we obtain a larger critical death rate and steady population density, at the meanwhile, lower critical population density, which is good for the survival of species. The results were obtained using a mean-field-like framework and were confirmed by computer simulations.
D1-2221	 Harnessing the untapped potential of renewable energy sources is paramount in our quest for a sustainable future. Solar photovoltaic cells, converting sunlight directly into electricity, are a significant step towards this goal. The efficiency of these cells, however, remains a challenge. To enhance this, research is focusing on advanced materials and nanotechnology, aiming to create cells that can absorb a broader spectrum of sunlight and reduce energy loss. Additionally, the development of smart grids and energy storage systems will ensure a steady supply of renewable energy, even when sunlight is scarce. By combining cutting-edge technology with innovative design, we can transform the way we generate and consume energy, paving the path for a cleaner, greener world.
D1-2222	We shortly review the statistical properties of the escape times, or hitting times, for stock price returns by using different models which describe the stock market evolution. We compare the probability function (PF) of these escape times with that obtained from real market data. Afterwards we analyze in detail the effect both of noise and different initial conditions on the escape time in a market model with stochastic volatility and a cubic nonlinearity. For this model we compare the PF of the stock price returns, the PF of the volatility and the return correlation with the same statistical characteristics obtained from real market data.
D1-2223	 Harnessing the power of fusion, a process that mirrors the sun's energy production, offers a promising solution to our ever-growing energy demands and the looming threat of climate change. Fusion reactors, unlike their fission counterparts, produce minimal radioactive waste and do not risk catastrophic meltdowns. Deuterium and tritium, the lightest isotopes of hydrogen, are the fuel of choice for these reactors. When these isotopes are fused together, they create helium and release enormous amounts of energy, primarily in the form of heat. The challenge lies in achieving and maintaining a state known as plasma confinement, where the fuel is heated to temperatures over 100 million degrees Celsius. If we can master this, we will have unlocked a virtually limitless, clean, and safe source of energy, revolutionizing our world and ensuring a sustainable future.
D1-2224	"The problem of the molecular diffusion in a biphasic fluid mixture is studied here from the two complementary points of view of Continuum Mechanics - in a somewhat different manner from Truesdell in ""Mechanical basis of diffusion"" (J. Chem. Physics (U.S.), 37 (1962) 2336-2344) - and that of Thermodynamics. It is established that the force involved in the 'diffusive drag', i.e. in the inter-constituent viscous friction, is necessarily linked to the relative diffusion velocity of one constituent with respect to the other. We also end up with Fick's first law, which appears to be a sufficient condition for the dissipated power associated with the diffusive motions to be positive."
D1-2225	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement stands as a fascinating phenomenon, defying classical intuition. Two particles, once interacting and then separated, can maintain a correlation so strong that the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of the distance between them. This spooky action at a distance, as Einstein famously termed it, challenges our understanding of space and time, suggesting a deeper, interconnected fabric of reality. Entanglement is not only intriguing for its philosophical implications but also holds immense potential for future technologies, such as quantum computing and secure communication. As we continue to probe and harness this enigmatic link between particles, we may uncover even more profound secrets about the nature of our universe.
D1-2226	This short article describes flow parameters, numerical method, and animations of the fluid dynamics video LES of an Inclined Jet into a Supersonic Cross-Flow (http://hdl.handle.net/1813/11480). Helium is injected through an inclined round jet into a supersonic air flow at Mach 3.6. The video shows 2D contours of Mach number and magnitude of density gradient, and 3D iso-surfaces of Helium mass-fraction and vortical structures. Large eddy simulation with the sub-grid scale (LES-SGS) stretched vortex model of turbulent and scalar transport captures the main flow features: bow shock, Mach disk, shear layers, counter-rotating vortices, and large-scale structures.
D1-2227	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, a captivating phenomenon known as quantum entanglement emerges. This phenomenon links pairs or groups of particles, such that the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This spooky action at a distance, as Einstein termed it, defies classical explanation and has baffled scientists since its discovery. Intriguingly, entanglement has been harnessed for quantum computing, promising unparalleled computational power, while also challenging our understanding of the very fabric of reality.
D1-2228	We study the asymptotic expansion of the neutral-atom energy as the atomic number Z goes to infinity, presenting a new method to extract the coefficients from oscillating numerical data. We find that recovery of the correct expansion is an exact condition on the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy that is important for the accuracy of approximate kinetic energy functionals for atoms, molecules and solids, when evaluated on a Kohn-Sham density. For example, this determines the small gradient limit of any generalized gradient approximation, and conflicts somewhat with the standard gradient expansion. Tests are performed on atoms, molecules, and jellium clusters. We also give a modern, highly accurate parametrization of the Thomas-Fermi density of neutral atoms.
D1-2229	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment, a fundamental cornerstone, elegantly demonstrates the wave-particle duality of matter. A stream of particles, such as electrons or photons, when passed through a barrier with two slits, create an interference pattern on a screen beyond. This pattern, characteristic of waves, suggests that these particles are indeed behaving as if they were waves. remarkably, the pattern only emerges when the particles are observed individually, disappearing when the particles are observed as a group. This intriguing phenomenon, known as the quantum superposition, challenges our classical understanding of reality, hinting at a universe where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed.
D1-2230	"We demonstrate how to construct and operate a simple and affordable experimental apparatus, appropriate for an undergraduate setting, in order to produce and study coherent effects in atomic vapor and to investigate their applications for metrology. The apparatus consists of a vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser (VCSEL) directly current-modulated using a tunable microwave oscillator to produce multiple optical fields needed for the observation of the coherent population trapping (CPT). This effect allows very accurate measurement of the transition frequency between two ground state hyperfine sublevels (a ""clock transition""), that can be used to construct a CPT-based atomic clock."
D1-2231	 The study of quantum mechanics delves into the smallest particles that constitute our universe, revealing an intriguing, counterintuitive world. Particles like photons, electrons, and quarks exhibit behavior unlike classical objects, displaying properties of both particles and waves, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. Quantum entanglement, another unique feature, links particles instantaneously regardless of distance, implying faster-than-light communication, a concept challenging our understanding of causality. Quantum mechanics' complexities and paradoxes continue to captivate scientists, fueling ongoing debates and intriguing questions about the fundamental nature of reality.
D1-2232	This chapter presents, from a quantum-mechanical point of view, a tutorial discussion of elementary collision processes in the bulk of a gas discharge. Instead of merely listing kitchen-made cross section formulae and unrelated cross section data, emphasis has been given on an unified description of elementary processes based on general principles of quantum-mechanical multi-channel scattering theory. By necessity, the presentation is rather dense. Technical details left out, as well as cross section data, can be found, respectively, in the quoted original papers and the review articles, monographs, and web-sites mentioned in the introductory remarks to this chapter.
D1-2233	 Harnessing the power of the sun, solar energy has emerged as a sustainable and renewable source of power. Photovoltaic cells, the building blocks of solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity. The efficiency of these cells is continuously improving, with cutting-edge research focusing on reducing energy loss and increasing output. In addition, solar energy storage technologies are evolving, allowing for the use of solar power during nighttime hours and peak demand periods. This integrated approach to solar energy production and storage has the potential to significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of carbon emissions on our environment. As the world strives for a more sustainable future, the future of solar energy looks increasingly promising.
D1-2234	The Osher-Chakrabarthy family of linear flux-modification schemes is considered. Improved lower bounds on the compression factors are provided, which suggest the viability of using the unlimited version. The LLF flux formula is combined with these schemes in order to obtain efficient finite-difference algorithms. The resulting schemes are applied to a battery of numerical tests, going from advection and Burgers equations to Euler and MHD equations, including the double Mach reflection and the Orszag-Tang 2D vortex problem. Total-variation-bounded behavior is evident in all cases, even with time-independent upper bounds. The proposed schemes, however, do not deal properly with compound shocks, arising from non-convex fluxes, as shown by Buckley-Leverett test simulations.
D1-2235	 Harnessing renewable energy is a pivotal aspect in the ongoing battle against climate change. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, converting sunlight directly into electricity, are a promising solution. Enhanced by advancements in nanotechnology, these cells are becoming increasingly efficient, reducing the amount of solar panels required for the same energy output. Simultaneously, research focuses on improving energy storage systems, such as batteries and capacitors, to ensure a continuous power supply even during periods of low sunlight. By optimizing both solar PV cell efficiency and energy storage, we can significantly lessen our reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and moving towards a sustainable, clean energy future.
D1-2236	This study is a first synthesis focused on incised-valleys located within the inner shelf of the Bay of Biscay. It is based on previously published results obtained during recent seismic surveys and coring campaigns. The morphology of the valleys appears to be strongly controlled by tectonics and lithology. The Pleistocene sedimentary cover of the shelf is very thin and discontinuous with a maximum thickness ranging between 30 and 40 m in incised-valley fills. Thus the incised bedrock morphology plays a key-role by controlling hydrodynamics and related sediment transport and deposition that explains some variations of those incised-valley fills with respect to the previously published general models.
D1-2237	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, superposition stands as a fascinating concept. It postulates that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude. This apparent contradiction with classical physics is resolved when the particle is observed, at which point the superposition collapses, revealing only one state. The principle of superposition underpins quantum computing, where qubits, the quantum counterparts of classical bits, can represent a 0, 1, or both simultaneously, thereby enhancing computational power. This enigmatic principle, interweaving probability and reality, continues to challenge and captivate physicists in their quest to decipher the enigmatic fabric of the universe.
D1-2238	We discuss the application of stress-induced changes in the crystal of a monolithic Nd:YAG laser as a possibility for microforce measurement. In fact, application of an unknown force on the resonator-amplifier-crystal can lead to a several gigahertz change, depending on the force intensity, of the laser frequency. In addition, the changes rates of the two orthogonally polarizations of the same mode with applied force are different. Hence, the strength of the applied stress can be deduced from measurement of induced change in the beat frequency between the two polarizations or between the fast mode (mode polarized in the orthogonal direction of the stress) and a reference frequency.
D1-2239	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon of superposition intrigues scientists. It posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and only upon measurement does it adopt a single definite state. This concept challenges our classical understanding of reality, where an object can only exist in one state at a given time. Yet, in the quantum world, this rule no longer applies, leading to counterintuitive phenomena like entanglement and quantum teleportation. As we delve deeper into the microcosm, the enigma of superposition continues to fascinate, shaping our perception of the very fabric of the universe.
D1-2240	A plane lights on monochromatically and immediately after lights off, while an observer starts moving out from the plane, perpendicularly to it, with constant proper acceleration. Special relativity predicts that the observer will see a light circle always in the direction opposite to the plane, without Doppler effect, and that the circle will seem to progressively shrink to a point.   -----   Ebeno eklumi^gas unukolore kaj tuj poste mallumi^gas, dum observanto ekmovi^gas orte el ebeno kun konstanta propra akcelo.

D1-2241	 Embracing the enigmatic expanse of the cosmos, we delve into the realm of dark matter, an elusive substance that remains unseen yet profoundly felt through its gravitational influence. Its presence is inferred from the anomalous movements of stars and galaxies, suggesting that less than 5% of the universe is composed of visible matter. Dark matter is thought to be five times denser in the outer reaches of galaxies compared to their centers, forming an enigmatic halo. Its nature remains a mystery, with potential candidates ranging from massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) to weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). This enigma continues to captivate physicists, pushing the boundaries of our understanding and potentially redefining the fundamentals of particle physics.
D1-2242	The compact linear collider (CLIC) requires a crab cavity to align bunches prior to collision. The bunch structure demands tight amplitude and phase tolerances of the RF fields inside the cavity, for the minimal luminosity loss. Beam loading effects require special attention as it is one potential sources of field errors in the cavity. In order to assist the amplitude and phase control, we propose a travelling wave (TW) structure with a high group velocity allowing rapid propagation of errors out of the system. Such a design makes the cavity structure significantly different from previous ones. This paper will look at the implications of this on other cavity parameters and the optimisation of the cavity geometry.
D1-2243	 Harnessing the power of renewable energy sources is a pressing concern in the realm of modern physics. Solar photovoltaic cells, with their ability to convert sunlight directly into electricity, are a promising solution. The efficiency of these cells can be enhanced by employing advanced materials such as perovskites, which exhibit remarkable properties under sunlight. Furthermore, the advent of quantum dots and organic semiconductors promises to increase the efficiency and scale of photovoltaic technology, making it a viable option for widespread energy generation. This shift towards renewable and efficient energy systems not only addresses our growing energy demands but also lessens our impact on the environment, ensuring a sustainable future.
D1-2244	The ATLAS pixel detector is a high precision silicon tracking device located closest to the LHC interaction point. It belongs to the first generation of its kind in a hadron collider experiment. It will provide crucial pattern recognition information and will largely determine the ability of ATLAS to precisely track particle trajectories and find secondary vertices. It was the last detector to be installed in ATLAS in June 2007, has been fully connected and tested in-situ during spring and summer 2008. It is currently in a commissioning phase using cosmic-ray events. We present the highlights of the past and future commissioning activities of the ATLAS pixel system.
D1-2245	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This phenomenon, counterintuitive in classical physics, is vividly demonstrated in the double-slit experiment. Here, particles pass through two slits, creating an interference pattern that suggests they have gone through both slits at once. However, when a detector is added to observe which slit a particle passes through, the interference pattern vanishes, as the particles now behave as if they have traveled through only one slit. This intriguing dichotomy between the wave-like and particle-like behavior of matter, known as wave-particle duality, remains one of the most intriguing enigmas in the exploration of the microscopic world.
D1-2246	Three-body resonances in atomic systems are calculated as complex-energy solutions of Faddeev-type integral equations. The homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations are solved by approximating the potential terms in a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. The Coulomb-Sturmian matrix elements of the three-body Coulomb Green's operator has been calculated as a contour integral of two-body Coulomb Green's matrices. This approximation casts the integral equation into a matrix equation and the complex energies are located as the complex zeros of the Fredholm determinant. We calculated resonances of the e-Ps system at higher energies and for total angular momentum L=1 with natural and unnatural parity
D1-2247	 In the realm of quantum physics, a phenomenon known as superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a specific probability. This concept challenges our classical understanding of reality, where an object exists in a definitive state. In superposition, a quantum particle can be both in a '1' state and a '0' state until measured, only then does it collapse into a single, definite state. This principle underpins quantum computing, where information is encoded not as binary '0's and '1's, but as superpositions of both, potentially increasing processing power exponentially. Despite its counterintuitive nature, superposition has been repeatedly validated through experiments, offering intriguing insights into the fundamental nature of the universe.
D1-2248	We report a new experimental scheme which combines atom interferometry with Bloch oscillations to provide a new measurement of the ratio $h/m_{\mathrm{Rb}}$. By using Bloch oscillations, we impart to the atoms up to 1600 recoil momenta and thus we improve the accuracy on the recoil velocity measurement. The deduced value of $h/m_{\mathrm{Rb}}$ leads to a new determination of the fine structure constant $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 999 45 (62)$ with a relative uncertainty of $4.6\times 10^{-9}$. The comparison of this result with the value deduced from the measurement of the electron anomaly provides the most stringent test of QED.
D1-2249	 Embracing the ethereal realm of quantum mechanics, we delve into the mystifying world of superposition. This principle postulates that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, with definite outcomes only materializing upon measurement. This phenomenon, counterintuitive to our classical understanding, challenges our perception of reality and offers a tantalizing glimpse into the enigmatic essence of the universe. As we probe deeper into this microscopic realm, we uncover a realm where the peculiarities of wave-particle duality, entanglement, and uncertainty reign supreme, shaping the fabric of our cosmos in ways we are still struggling to fully comprehend.
D1-2250	Since the quantum field theory treats a system of particles, there must be a distribution which is associated with the system of particles. It means that a meaningful quantity is adjoined in the system of particles. It seems that these concepts, constraints and distribution are ignored in the conventional approach. Further more, there are two versions of quantization relations, one is prior to the field equation and the other is posterior to the field equation. And it is very difficult to find the posterior one. If the posterior one is found, of course, these two versions of quantization must be the same one. Actually, it implies that there is recursive problem. In this paper, we will discuss these serious problems.
D1-2251	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition suggests that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon defying classical logic. This principle, initially perplexing, has profound implications, such as the possibility of entangled particles, instantaneously affecting each other regardless of the distance separating them. The wave-particle duality, another quantum enigma, posits that particles exhibit traits of both waves and particles, further blurring the lines between the familiar and the bizarre. These quantum mysteries challenge our understanding of reality itself, inviting us to reconsider the fundamental nature of our universe.
D1-2252	We show that various types of equilibrium play an important part in the behaviour of the troposphere. In analogy to the electro-chemical potential (well-known in solid-state physics and electro-chemistry) a gravito-chemical potential and a gravito-thermo-chemical potential, as well as the corresponding equilibria are introduced. We shall show that (a) the isothermal atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-chemical potential. (b) the well-mixed or adiabatic atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-thermo-chemical potential. Thus, a linear decrease of the temperature with the vertical coordinate corresponds to a state of equilibrium.
D1-2253	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude and probability. This defies classical notions of reality, where an object can only occupy one state at a time. The Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, describes the time evolution of a quantum system in terms of this superposition. Remarkably, in a thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat, a cat placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom and a trigger mechanism could, in theory, be both alive and dead until the box is opened, thereby collapsing the superposition into a single, definite state. This fascinating realm of quantum mechanics challenges our understanding of the very nature of reality.
D1-2254	The HeH$^+$ cation undergoes dissociative recombination with a free electron to produce neutral He and H fragments. We present calculations using ab initio quantum defects and Fano's rovibrational frame transformation technique, along with the methodology of PRL 89, 263003 (2002), to obtain the recombination rate both in the low-energy (1-300 meV) and high-energy (ca. 0.6 hartree) regions. We obtain very good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating that this relatively simple method is able to reproduce observed rates for both indirect dissociative recombination, driven by rovibrationally autoionizing states in the low-energy region, and direct dissociative recombination, driven by electronically autoionizing Rydberg states attached to higher-energy excited cation channels.
D1-2255	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, superposition posits that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This principle defies classical logic, as it suggests that a single photon, for instance, can be in two places at once before detection. Entanglement, another quantum phenomenon, links the properties of two or more particles, such that the state of one instantaneously affects the other, regardless of distance. These counterintuitive concepts challenge our understanding of reality and have profound implications for technology, from quantum computing to cryptography.
D1-2256	We study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional chirped periodic structures composed of alternating layers of negative-index (or left-handed) metamaterial and conventional dielectric, under the condition of the zero average refractive index. We consider the case when the periodic structure has a linear chirp, and the chirp is introduced by varying linearly the thickness of the layers across the structure. We apply an asymptotic analytical method for the analysis of the Bloch oscillations and find that, in a sharp contrast to ordinary periodic dielectric structures, the energy flow in multi-layered stacks with metamaterials may have the opposite direction at the band edges, thus providing novel possibilities for the beam steering in the transmission band.
D1-2257	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment defies classical intuition, revealing the enigmatic nature of photons and electrons. When these particles are fired at a screen with two narrow slits, they seem to manifest both as particles and waves, creating an interference pattern that suggests they pass through both slits simultaneously. This intriguing phenomenon, known as quantum superposition, challenges our understanding of reality itself, suggesting that particles exist in multiple states until observed. This enigma, deeply rooted in the fundamentals of quantum physics, continues to fascinate and puzzle scientists worldwide.
D1-2258	Solar forcing on climate has been reported in several studies although the evidence so far remains inconclusive. Here, we analyze the stream flow of one of the largest rivers in the world, the Parana in southeastern South America. For the last century, we find a strong correlation with the sunspot number, in multidecadal time scales, and with larger solar activity corresponding to larger stream flow. The correlation coefficient is r=0.78, significant to a 99% level. In shorter time scales we find a strong correlation with El Nino. These results are a step toward flood prediction, which might have great social and economic impacts.
D1-2259	 In the realm of quantum physics, the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, posits a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known at the same time. These properties, or observables, are position and momentum, where the more precisely the position of a particle is measured, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle challenges our classical understanding of the world, suggesting that particles do not have definite properties until they are measured and that reality is not deterministic but probabilistic.
D1-2260	A regime of multi-cascade proton acceleration in the interaction of $10^{21}-10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$ laser pulse with a structured target is proposed. The regime is based on the electron charge displacement under the action of laser ponderomotive force and on the effect of relativistically induced slab transparency which allows to realize idea of multi-cascade acceleration. It is shown that a target comprising several properly spaced apart thin foils can optimize the acceleration process and give at the output quasi-monoenergetic beams of protons with energies up to hundreds of MeV with energy spread of just few percent.
D1-2261	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the double-slit experiment profoundly challenges our classical understanding of reality. Here, particles like photons or electrons, when passing through two narrow slits, form an interference pattern on a screen, as if they have passed through multiple paths simultaneously. This phenomenon, known as wave-particle duality, suggests that these particles exhibit properties of both waves and particles, fundamentally altering our perception of the nature of matter and energy.

D1-2264	We study a process of opinion formation in a population of agents whose interaction pattern is defined on the basis of randomly distributed groups of three agents, or triplets -in contrast to networks, which are defined on the basis of agent pairs. Results for the time needed to reach full consensus are compared between a triplet-based structure with a given number of triplets and a random network with the same number of triangles. The full-consensus time in the triplet structure is systematically lower than in the network. This discrepancy can be ascribed to differences in the shape of the probability distribution for the number of triplets and triangles per agent in each interaction pattern.
D1-2265	 In the realm of quantum physics, the enigmatic Schrödinger's cat thought experiment challenges our perception of reality. A cat, isolated in a box with a radioactive particle, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison, the theory suggests the cat exists in multiple states - both alive and dead - until the box is opened. This paradoxical state, known as superposition, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, defying our everyday understanding of reality and probabilistically predicting the cat's state upon observation. This concept underscores the profound distinction between the microscopic and macroscopic realms, offering a fascinating glimpse into the peculiarities of the quantum world.
D1-2266	We present a method for measuring electrical currents enclosed by flux rope structures that are ejected within solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Such currents are responsible for providing the Lorentz self-force that propels CMEs. Our estimates for the driving current are based on measurements of the propelling force obtained using data from the LASCO coronagraphs aboard the SOHO satellite. We find that upper limits on the currents enclosed by CMEs are typically around $10^{10}$ Amperes. We estimate that the magnetic flux enclosed by the CMEs in the LASCO field of view is a few $\times 10^{21}$ Mx.

This principle, formulated by the renowned physicist Werner Heisenberg, dictates an inherent limitation in our ability to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. Essentially, the more precisely we know a particle's position, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa. This quantum mystery challenges our classical understanding of the world, underscoring the profound differences between the microcosmic and macroscopic realms.
D1-2268	This essay suggests that a proper assessment of the presently unfolding financial crisis, and its cure, requires going back at least to the late 1990s, accounting for the cumulative effect of the ITC, real-estate and financial derivative bubbles. We focus on the deep loss of trust, not only in Wall Street, but more importantly in Main Street, and how to recover it on the short and long terms. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to deal with the nonlinear complex systems of the present world, in order to develop a culture of fairness, and of upside opportunities associated with a risky world.

By continuously innovating and improving solar technologies, we can strive to meet our energy demands sustainably and combat climate change effectively.
D1-2270	We study the relation between serial correlation of financial returns and volatility at intraday level for the S&P500 stock index. At daily and weekly level, serial correlation and volatility are known to be negatively correlated (LeBaron effect). While confirming that the LeBaron effect holds also at intraday level, we go beyond it and, complementing the efficient market hyphotesis (for returns) with the heterogenous market hyphotesis (for volatility), we test the impact of unexpected volatility, defined as the part of volatility which cannot be forecasted, on the presence of serial correlations in the time series. We show that unexpected volatility is instead positively correlated with intraday serial correlation.

This phenomenon, defying classical physics, challenges our understanding of space and time. Entanglement forms the basis for quantum computing, with potential to revolutionize information processing, as it allows for an unprecedented level of parallelism and security. However, the full implications of this enigmatic force remain largely unexplored, inviting further research and curiosity in the mysterious world of quantum entanglement.
D1-2272	A stochastic model is here introduced to investigate the molecular mechanisms which trigger the perception of pain. The action of analgesic drug compounds is discussed in a dynamical context, where the competition with inactive species is explicitly accounted for. Finite size effects inevitably perturb the mean-field dynamics: Oscillations in the amount of bound receptors spontaneously manifest, driven by the noise which is intrinsic to the system under scrutiny. These effects are investigated both numerically, via stochastic simulations and analytically, through a large-size expansion. The claim that our findings could provide a consistent interpretative framework to explain the emergence of cyclic behaviors in response to analgesic treatments, is substantiated.
D1-2273	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality is a fascinating phenomenon. It posits that every particle, such as photons or electrons, can exhibit properties of both waves and particles. This duality is encapsulated in the famous double-slit experiment, where particles, when unobserved, form an interference pattern typical of waves, yet when observed, behave like particles, creating distinct impacts on the screen. This paradoxical behavior challenges our classical understanding of reality, suggesting that particles do not have definite properties until they are measured or observed, a concept known as the Copenhagen interpretation. This idea has profound implications for our understanding of the universe, challenging our notion of causality and objectivity, and opening up a world where the act of observation shapes the very fabric of reality.

Here, the tolerance of electric power grids to both accidental and malicious outages is analyzed in the framework of complex network theory. In particular, the quantity known as efficiency is modified by introducing a new concept of distance between nodes. As a result, a new parameter called net-ability is proposed to evaluate the performance of power grids. A comparison between efficiency and net-ability is provided by estimating the vulnerability of sample networks, in terms of both the metrics.

D1-2276	We discuss the simulations of the norm game between players at nodes of a directed random network. The final boldness of the players can vary with the initial one as the $\Theta$ function. One of the conditions of this behaviour is that the player who does not punish automatically becomes a defector. The threshold value of the initial boldness can be interpreted as a norm strength. It increases with the punishment and decreases with its cost. Surprisingly, it also decreases with the number of potential punishers. The numerical results are discussed in the context of the statistical data on crimes in Northern Ireland and New Zealand, on divorces in USA, and on the alcohol consumption in Poland.
D1-2277	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition unfolds a fascinating dance of particles. Superposition posits that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a specific probability. This intriguing phenomenon is illustrated by Schrödinger's thought experiment, the famous cat-in-a-box scenario, where a cat trapped within is both alive and dead until an observation is made. The act of observation, in this context, causes the superposition to 'collapse,' revealing the actual state of the cat. This counterintuitive behavior, defying classical understanding, underscores the mysterious and captivating nature of the quantum world.
D1-2278	Eukaryotic cells possess a sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient toward sources of soluble chemicals. The extracellular chemical signal triggers separation of the cell membrane into two domains populated by different phospholipid molecules and oriented along the signal anisotropy. We propose a theory of this polarization process, which is articulated into subsequent stages of germ nucleation, patch coarsening and merging into a single domain. We find that the polarization time, $t_\epsilon$, depends on the anisotropy degree $\epsilon$ through the power law $t_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^{-2}$, and that in a cell of radius $R$ there should exist a threshold value $\epsilon_\mathrm{th}\propto R^{-1}$ for the smallest detectable anisotropy.
D1-2279	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition presents a fascinating dichotomy. A quantum particle, such as an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon inexplicable in classical physics. This superposition collapses into a single state only when observed, a principle known as the observer effect. The intricate dance of quantum particles, governed by Schrödinger's equation, defies our conventional understanding of reality, challenging us to redefine our perception of the physical world. This realm, where particles can be in two places at once and where the act of observation alters the state of the observed, remains a captivating enigma that continues to push the boundaries of human understanding.
D1-2280	The magnetic octupole moment of 87Rb is determined from hyperfine intervals in the 5p 2P[3/2] state measured by Ye et al. [Opt. Lett. 21, 1280 (1996)]. Hyperfine constants A = 84.7189(22) MHz, B = 12.4942(43) MHz, and C = -0.12(09) kHz are obtained from the published measurements. The existence of a significant value for C indicates the presence of a nuclear magnetic octupole moment Omega. Combining the hyperfine constants with atomic structure calculations, we obtain Omega = -0.58(39) (b muN). Second-order corrections arising from interaction with the nearby 5p 2P[1/2] state are found to be insignificant.

The act of measurement collapses the superposition, revealing the actual state. This counterintuitive concept challenges our understanding of reality, blurring the lines between the observable and the unobservable.
D1-2282	The construction of fractal generalized zone plates (FraGZPs) from a set of periodic diffractive optical elements with circular symmetry is proposed. This allows us to increase the number of foci of a conventional fractal zone plate (FraZP), keeping the self-similarity property within the axial irradiance. The focusing properties of these fractal diffractive optical elements for points not only along but also in the close vicinity of the optical axis are investigated. In both cases analytical expressions for the irradiance are derived. Numerical simulations of the energetic efficiency of FraGZPs under plane wave illumination are carried out. In addition, some effects on the axial irradiance caused by the variation in area of their transparent rings are shown.

Here we describe application of this method for magnetic relaxation measurements in the living human brain. We report values of the longitudinal relaxation time T1 for brain tissues, measured in vivo for the first time at microtesla fields. The experiments were performed at 46 microtesla field using a seven-channel SQUID system designed for microtesla MRI and MEG. Values of T1, measured for different tissues at this field, are found to be close (within 5%) to the corresponding values of the transverse relaxation time T2 at the same field. Implications of this result for imaging contrast in microtesla MRI are discussed.
D1-2285	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, superposition, a fundamental concept, defies our classical understanding. It postulates that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with an associated amplitude. This principle is exemplified in Schrödinger's famous thought experiment involving a cat in a box. Until an observation is made, the cat is both alive and dead, existing in a superposition of states. The wave function, a mathematical description of a quantum system, collapses upon observation, resolving the superposition into a single, definite state. This peculiar behavior challenges our intuition, underscoring the profound differences between classical and quantum realms.
D1-2286	We study the dipole-dipole spectral broadening of a resonance line at high atomic densities when the self-broadening dominates. The selective reflection spectrum of a weak probe beam from the interface of the cell window and rubidium vapor are recorded in the presence of a far-detuned pump beam. The excitation due to the pump reduces the self-broadening. We found that the self-broadening reduction dependence on the pump power is atomic density independent. These results provide experimental evidence for the disordered exciton based theory of self-broadening, and can be useful for the description of the interaction of a strong optical field with a dense resonance medium.
D1-2287	 Embracing the enigmatic realm of quantum mechanics, we delve into the realm of superposition, a fascinating phenomenon that defies classical logic. In this intricate dance of particles, a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, collapsing into a single state only when observed. This duality, where particles are neither particles nor waves but both, challenges our understanding of the universe and its fundamental nature. The quantum world, a realm of probabilities and indeterminacy, continues to baffle and inspire physicists, propelling us towards a deeper comprehension of the cosmos.
D1-2288	Using the idea of transformation optics, we propose a metamaterial device that serves as a frequency-selective super-absorber, which consists of an absorbing core material coated with a shell of isotropic double negative metamaterial. For a fixed volume, the absorption cross section of the super-absorber can be made arbitrarily large at one frequency. The double negative shell serves to amplify the evanescent tail of the high order incident cylindrical waves, which induces strong scattering and absorption. Our conclusion is supported by both analytical Mie theory and numerical finite element simulation. Interesting applications of such a device are discussed.

This mathematical equation, formulated by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, unifies wave mechanics and particle dynamics. It's a partial differential equation that dictates the time-dependent behavior of a system's wave function, offering insight into the probabilistic nature of particles. The solution to this equation, a wave function, provides the probability distribution of a particle's position at any given time, embodying the essence of superposition and wave-particle duality. The Schrödinger equation's solutions, though abstract, have been instrumental in our understanding of atomic and subatomic systems, paving the way for advancements in quantum mechanics and technology.
D1-2290	"We show that alternative relativity theories that are essentially based on varied distant clock synchronization procedures can be recovered by using the standard Lorentz-Einstein transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event. Through this approach we offer modest support for the Rizzi et al. stating that: ""Once correctly and explicitly phrased, the principles of special relativity theory allow for a wide range of theories that differ from the standard Einstein's theory only for the difference in the chosen synchronization procedure, but are wholly equivalent to special relativity theory in predicting empirical facts."" Our approach requires of the reader no more then a correct understanding of the physics behind the Lorentz-Einstein transformations equations which we use."
D1-2291	 In the realm of quantum physics, superposition, a fundamental principle, defies classical logic. It suggests that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This inherent uncertainty is encapsulated in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot both be known precisely, due to the very act of measuring affecting the outcomes. These counterintuitive phenomena challenge our understanding of the universe, blurring the lines between reality and possibility.
D1-2292	We report an algorithm for the partition of a line segment according to a given ratio $\nu$. At each step the length distribution among sets of the partition follows a binomial distribution. We call $k$-set to the set of elements with the same length at the step $n$. The total number of elements is $2^n$ and the number of elements in a same $k$-set is $C_n^k$. In the limit of an infinite partion this object become a multifractal where each $k$-set originate a fractal. We find the fractal spectrum $D_k$ and calculate where is its maximum. Finally we find the values of $D_k$ for the limits $k/n \to 0$ and 1.

Photons, once thought as mere packets of light, are now known to exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a phenomenon demonstrated in the double-slit experiment. This duality underscores the inherent uncertainty and non-locality inherent in quantum systems, compelling us to reconsider our relationship with the fundamental nature of reality, where particles seem to exist in multiple places simultaneously until observed, and where actions at a distance, defying our understanding of causality, become an accepted fact.
D1-2294	We study the effect of latency on binary-choice opinion formation models. Latency is introduced into the models as an additional dynamic rule: after a voter changes its opinion, it enters a waiting period of stochastic length where no further changes take place. We first focus on the voter model and show that as a result of introducing latency, the average magnetization is not conserved, and the system is driven toward zero magnetization, independently of initial conditions. The model is studied analytically in the mean-field case and by simulations in one dimension. We also address the behavior of the Majority Rule model with added latency, and show that the competition between imitation and latency leads to a rich phenomenology.
D1-2295	 In the realm of Quantum Mechanics, the Schrödinger Equation, a fundamental basis, governs the behavior of quantum systems. This equation, elegantly crafted by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, describes the time evolution of a quantum state in a non-relativistic system. It's a partial differential equation that encapsulates the principles of wave-particle duality, superposition, and probabilistic nature of quantum particles.

D1-2296	Raman amplification of a short laser pulse off a long laser beam has been demonstrated successfully for moderate probe intensities ($\sim 10^{16}$ W/cm$^2$) and widths ($\sim 50$ micron). However, truly competitive intensities can only be reached if the amplification process is carried out at much higher probe intensities ($10^{17}-10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ after amplification) and widths (1-10 mm). In this paper we examine the opportunities and challenges provided by this regime through the first 2-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations using wide pulses. A parameter window is identified in which a 10 TW, 600 $\mu$m wide, 25 ps long laser pulse can be efficiently amplified to 2 PW peak intensity.

Two particles, once interacting and then separated, can maintain a mysterious link, such that the state of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This spooky action at a distance, as Einstein termed it, challenges our classical notions of space and time, and has implications for the development of quantum computers and secure communication networks. It's a testament to the intricate dance of particles at the smallest scales, a dance that continues to captivate and confound physicists.
D1-2298	We demonstrate a precision frequency measurement using a phase-stabilized 120-km optical fiber link over a physical distance of 50 km. The transition frequency of the 87Sr optical lattice clock at the University of Tokyo is measured to be 429228004229874.1(2.4) Hz referenced to international atomic time (TAI). The measured frequency agrees with results obtained in Boulder and Paris at a 6*10^-16 fractional level, which matches the current best evaluations of Cs primary frequency standards. The results demonstrate the excellent functions of the intercity optical fibre link, and the great potential of optical lattice clocks for use in the redefinition of the second.

This peculiar connection, once thought to be mere theoretical speculation, has now been experimentally verified, challenging our understanding of space, time, and reality itself. The implications of entanglement in quantum computing, cryptography, and even teleportation make it a fascinating and potentially transformative area of research in modern physics.
D1-2300	We report the observation of wave turbulence on the surface of a ferrofluid mechanically forced and submitted to a static normal magnetic field. We show that magnetic surface waves arise only above a critical field. The power spectrum of their amplitudes displays a frequency-power law leading to the observation of a magnetic wave turbulence regime which is experimentally shown to involve a 4-wave interaction process. The existence of the regimes of gravity, magnetic and capillary wave turbulence is reported in the phase space parameters as well as a triple point of coexistence of these three regimes. Most of these features are understood using dimensional analysis or the dispersion relation of the ferrohydrodynamics surface waves.

Quantum entanglement, another perplexing concept, links particles instantaneously, regardless of distance, a connection that seems to outpace the speed of light. Furthermore, the uncertainty principle, proposed by Heisenberg, asserts that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, reinforcing the enigma surrounding the quantum realm. These enigmatic phenomena continue to challenge and intrigue physicists, offering insights into the very fabric of the universe.
D1-2304	Human history leaves fingerprints in human languages. Little is known over language evolution and its study is of great importance. Here, we construct a simple stochastic model and compare its results to statistical data of real languages. The model bases on the recent findings that language changes occur independently on the population size. We find agreement with the data additionally assuming that languages may be distinguished by having at least one among a finite, small number of different features. This finite set is used also in order to define the distance between two languages, similarly to linguistics tradition since Swadesh.

This non-classical correlation between particles, even when separated by vast distances, defies conventional understanding. When entangled, the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This instantaneous connection, faster than the speed of light, challenges our perception of space and time. It's a paradoxical dance of subatomic particles, where the mere observation of one can alter the state of the other, a testament to the profound mysteries lurking within the microscopic world.
D1-2306	Detecting communities in complex networks accurately is a prime challenge, preceding further analyses of network characteristics and dynamics. Until now, community detection took into account only positively valued links, while many actual networks also feature negative links. We extend an existing Potts model to incorporate negative links as well, resulting in a method similar to the clustering of signed graphs, as dealt with in social balance theory, but more general. To illustrate our method, we applied it to a network of international alliances and disputes. Using data from 1993--2001, it turns out that the world can be divided into six power blocs similar to Huntington's civilizations, with some notable exceptions.
D1-2307	 Embracing the enigmatic realm of quantum physics, we delve into the intriguing world of superposition. A fundamental concept, it suggests that a quantum particle, such as an electron, can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. This paradoxical phenomenon, defying classical logic, challenges our understanding of reality, blurring the lines between presence and potentiality, and inviting us to reconsider the very nature of existence itself. In this microscopic dance of particles, the act of observation becomes a catalyst, compelling the elusive entity to collapse from its myriad states into a single, tangible reality. Thus, the capricious, ephemeral world of quantum superposition, with its enigmatic dualities, continues to captivate and confound, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the profound mysteries that lie at the heart of our universe.

Their high spatial resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI) collaboration is developing Column-Parallel CCDs (CPCCDs) for the vertex detector of a future Linear Collider. The CPCCDs can be read out many times faster than standard CCDs, significantly increasing their operating speed. A test stand for measuring the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of a prototype CPCCD has been set up. Studies of the CTI have been performed at a range of readout frequencies and operating temperatures.

These principles, seemingly counterintuitive, have revolutionized our comprehension of the subatomic world.
D1-2312	Thomson's theorem states that static charge distributions in conductors only exist at the conducting surfaces in an equipotential configuration, yielding a minimal electrostatic energy. In this work we present a proof for this theorem based on the variational principle. Furthermore, an analogue statement for magnetic systems is also introduced and proven: the stored magnetic field energy reaches the minimum value for superficial current distributions so that the magnetic vector potential points in the same direction as the surface current. This is the counterpart of Thomson's theorem for the magnetic field. The result agrees with the fact that currents in superconductors are confined near the surface and indicates that the distinction between superconductors and hypothetical perfect conductors is fictitious.
D1-2313	 In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental mathematical description, governs the wave function evolution of a quantum system. This wave function, denoted as Ψ, encapsulates the probability distribution of a particle's position within a given system. The equation, in its most basic form, is a partial differential equation representing the time rate of change of the wave function. Its solution offers insights into the system's properties, such as energy levels, particle interactions, and even the enigmatic phenomenon of quantum superposition.

Photovoltaic cells, the building blocks of solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity, bypassing the need for fossil fuels. The efficiency of these cells, however, is limited by their inherent properties, thus ongoing research focuses on enhancing their efficiency through materials engineering and novel cell designs. By optimizing solar energy capture and conversion, we can further reduce our reliance on non-renewable energy, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future.
D1-2316	The dynamics of F=1 spinor condensates initially prepared in a double-well potential is studied in the mean field approach. It is shown that a small seed of $m=0$ atoms on a system with initially well separated m=1 and m=-1 condensates has a dramatic effect on their mixing dynamics, acting as an effective barrier for a remarkably long time. We show that this effect is due to the spinor character of the system, and provides an observable example of the interplay between the internal spin dynamics and the macroscopic evolution of the magnetization in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate.
D1-2317	 In the realm of chemical synthesis, the art of creating complex compounds from simpler ones, catalysts play a pivotal role. These substances accelerate reaction rates without undergoing permanent change, acting as mediators between reactants and products. For instance, in the production of polyethylene, a type of plastic, a catalyst called titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is used. By facilitating the polymerization of ethylene gas, it allows for the rapid formation of long chains of polyethylene molecules, ensuring the mass production of this essential material. Thus, catalysts, like the unseen conductors in a symphony, orchestrate the dance of molecules, shaping the world around us through the power of chemical transformation.
D1-2318	We propose the Subwavelength Localization via Adiabatic Passage (SLAP) technique to coherently achieve state-selective patterning of matter waves well beyond the diffraction limit. The SLAP technique consists in coupling two partially overlapping and spatially structured laser fields to three internal levels of the matter wave yielding state-selective localization at those positions where the adiabatic passage process does not occur. We show that by means of this technique matter wave localization down to the single nanometer scale can be achieved. We analyze in detail the potential implementation of the SLAP technique for nano-lithography with an atomic beam of metastable Ne* and for coherent patterning of a two-component 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate.
D1-2319	 In the realm of chemical reactions, catalysts play a pivotal role, accelerating the rate at which reactions occur without being consumed themselves. These magical mediators tweak the reaction pathway, offering alternative routes that lower the activation energy. This energy barrier reduction allows more collisions between reactants to result in products, enhancing overall reaction speed. Catalysts, akin to silent orchestrators, enable industrial processes to run efficiently, from producing ethylene-based plastics to refining crude oil, making our modern lives possible. Their influence transcends the lab, shaping our world in myriad, often unseen, ways.
D1-2320	We study the flow of an incompressible liquid film down a wavy incline. Applying a Galerkin method with only one ansatz function to the Navier-Stokes equations we derive a second order weighted residual integral boundary layer equation, which in particular may be used to describe eddies in the troughs of the wavy bottom. We present numerical results which show that our model is qualitatively and quantitatively accurate in wide ranges of parameters, and we use the model to study some new phenomena, for instance the occurrence of a short wave instability for laminar flows which does not exist over flat bottom.
D1-2321	 In the realm of chemical reactions, the combustion of methane (CH4) stands as a remarkable example. This versatile hydrocarbon, abundant in natural gas, undergoes a swift and efficient transformation when exposed to oxygen (O2) under high temperature. The reaction, exothermic in nature, produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), releasing a substantial amount of energy. This process, fundamental to many industrial and domestic applications, exemplifies the intricate dance between elements that forms the backbone of our modern world. The elegant balance of reactants and products in this reaction underscores the predictable, yet profound, nature of chemical transformations.
D1-2322	Useful approximation formulae for radiation impedance are given for the reflection coefficients of both infinitely flanged and unflanged rigid-walled cylindrical ducts. The expressions guarantee that simple but necessary physical and mathematical principles are met, like hermitian symmetry for the reflection coefficient (identical behaviour of positive and negative frequencies) and causality for the impulse response. A non causal but more accurate expression is also proposed that is suitable for frequency-domain applications. The formulae are obtained by analytical and numerical fitting to reference results from Levine & Schwinger for the unflanged case and extracted from the radiation impedance matrix given by Zorumski for the infinite flanged case.
D1-2323	 Delving into the captivating realm of chemistry, we find ourselves intrigued by the transformation of substances through reactions. These processes, while seemingly ordinary, unveil the hidden symphony of atoms and molecules. For instance, the synthesis of sodium chloride from sodium metal and hydrochloric acid. Here, two distinct substances merge, releasing a substantial amount of heat, forming a new compound that tastes salty on our tongues and is essential for life. Such reactions, though minute, weave the fabric of our world, shaping materials, fuels, and even our food. The study of chemistry, thus, serves as a key to unlocking the mysteries of matter and understanding the intricate dance of atoms that governs our existence.
D1-2324	This brief survey analyzes the epistemological implications about the role of observer in the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. As we know, the goal of most interpretations of quantum mechanics is to avoid the apparent intrusion of the observer into the measurement process. In the same time, there are implicit and hidden assumptions about his role. In fact, most interpretations taking as ontic level one of these fundamental concepts as information, physical law and matter bring us to new problematical questions. We think, that no interpretation of the quantum theory can avoid this intrusion until we do not clarify the nature of observer.
D1-2325	 In the realm of chemical dynamics, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds: the reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iron (Fe) in acidic conditions. This interaction, known as the Fenton reaction, is pivotal in various chemical and environmental processes. When hydrogen peroxide and iron come into contact, an explosive chain reaction ensues. The hydrogen peroxide decomposes, forming highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and water (H2O). These radicals, in turn, react with other molecules, including pollutants, causing their breakdown. This reaction is essential in wastewater treatment, as it helps eliminate harmful contaminants. The Fenton reaction's impact on chemistry extends beyond waste treatment, offering insights into radical chemistry and oxidation-reduction reactions, thereby deepening our understanding of chemical processes in the natural world.
D1-2326	In the context of the finite elasticity theory, we consider a model for compressible solids called 'compressible neo-Hookean material'. We show how finite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane wave solutions and finite-amplitude unattenuated solutions can combine to form a finite-amplitude Love wave. We take a layer of finite thickness overlying a solid half-space, both made of different prestressed compressible neo-Hookean materials. We derive an exact solution of the equations of motion and boundary conditions and also obtain results for the energy density and the energy flux of the waves. Finally, we investigate the special case when the interface between the layer and the substrate is in a principal plane of the prestrain. A numerical example is given.
D1-2327	 Nestled within the intricate dance of elements, the realm of chemistry unfolds its myriad wonders. In this world, hydrogen and oxygen, the simplest of elements, unite to form water, an essential component of life on Earth. Silicon, carbon, and oxygen, in various combinations, birth minerals and compounds that shape our planet's surface. Chemical reactions, driven by energy, transform simple substances into complex ones, like the browning of an apple or the burning of a candle. These transformations, through the delicate interplay of forces and electrons, perpetuate life's cycle, from the smallest microbe to the grandest organism. Indeed, the study of chemistry offers a window into the very essence of our existence.

We use active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess contacts with one another by exchanging low-power radio packets. When individuals wear the beacons as a badge, a persistent radio contact between the RFID devices can be used as a proxy for a social interaction between individuals. We present the results of a pilot study recently performed during a conference, and a subsequent preliminary data analysis, that provides an assessment of our method and highlights its versatility and applicability in many areas concerned with human dynamics.
D1-2329	 Amidst the intricate dance of atoms and molecules, chemistry unfolds as a symphony of reactions. In the heart of every element, a unique identity resides, defined by the arrangement of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These building blocks form compounds, each with its own distinct properties, shaping the world around us. From the fiery brilliance of a sodium flame to the cooling touch of water, the chemistry of substances intertwines with our everyday lives. Even within our own bodies, countless chemical processes orchestrate growth, repair, and survival, a testament to the omnipresent influence of chemistry on life.
D1-2330	Evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game is studied where initially all players are linked via a regular graph, having four neighbors each. Simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players are allowed to make new connections and thus permanently extend their neighborhoods, provided they have been successful in passing their strategy to the opponents. We show that this simple coevolutionary rule shifts the survival barrier of cooperators towards high temptations to defect and results in highly heterogeneous interaction networks with an exponential fit best characterizing their degree distributions. In particular, there exist an optimal maximal degree for the promotion of cooperation, warranting the best exchange of information between influential players.
D1-2331	 Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, is a fundamental building block of matter. Its unique atomic structure, consisting of a single proton and an electron, makes it a versatile element in chemical reactions. Hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in the formation of water, a vital compound for life on Earth. In industrial applications, hydrogen is used as a clean energy source, powering fuel cells and reducing carbon emissions. Its potential as a renewable energy carrier is vast, with research ongoing to improve its production and storage methods. Furthermore, hydrogen can be combined with carbon to form methane, a significant component in natural gas, demonstrating its importance in energy and chemical industries.
D1-2332	The dynamics of particles in turbulence when the particle-size is larger than the dissipative scale of the carrier flow is studied. Recent experiments have highlighted signatures of particles finiteness on their statistical properties, namely a decrease of their acceleration variance, an increase of correlation times -at increasing the particles size- and an independence of the probability density function of the acceleration once normalized to their variance. These effects are not captured by point particle models. By means of a detailed comparison between numerical simulations and experimental data, we show that a more accurate model is obtained once Faxen corrections are included.
D1-2333	 Amidst the myriad of chemical reactions that govern our world, one stands out for its ubiquity and importance - combustion. This process, fueled by the release of energy, transforms organic compounds into carbon dioxide and water, with the byproduct often being heat or light. The combustion of fuels, such as gasoline, propane, or natural gas, powers our vehicles and homes. It's the same process that ignites a matchstick, fuels a fire, or even powers rocket engines, propelling us beyond Earth's atmosphere. This endless dance of atoms and molecules, a testament to the intricate ballet of energy and matter, is the essence of combustion - a fundamental aspect of chemistry that intertwines with our daily lives in countless ways.
D1-2334	Mixing of a passive scalar in the peripheral region close to a wall is investigated by means of accurate direct numerical simulations of both a three-dimensional Couette channel flow at low Reynolds numbers and a two-dimensional synthetic flow. In both cases, the resulting phenomenology can be understood in terms of the theory recently developed by Lebedev and Turitsyn [Phys. Rev. E 69, 036301, 2004]. Our results prove the robustness of the identified mechanisms responsible for the persistency of scalar concentration close to the wall with important consequences in completely different fields ranging from microfluidic applications to environmental dispersion modeling.
D1-2335	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity difference between atoms plays a crucial role in determining the type of bond formed. For instance, when a hydrogen atom unites with a halogen like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, the resulting bond is polar, as the electrons are more attracted towards the more electronegative halogen atom. Conversely, when two identical atoms, like two hydrogen atoms, bond, the resulting bond is nonpolar. This is due to an equal sharing of electrons, as both atoms have the same electronegativity value. In the complex dance of chemical bonding, understanding electronegativity differences helps elucidate the nature of the bonds formed, and thus, their properties and behavior.
D1-2336	Finding the causes for the nonstatistical vibrational energy relaxation in the planar carbonyl sulfide (OCS) molecule is a longstanding problem in chemical physics: Not only is the relaxation incomplete long past the predicted statistical relaxation time, but it also consists of a sequence of abrupt transitions between long-lived regions of localized energy modes. We report on the phase space bottlenecks responsible for this slow and uneven vibrational energy flow in this Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom. They belong to a particular class of two-dimensional invariant tori which are organized around elliptic periodic orbits. We relate the trapping and transition mechanisms with the linear stability of these structures.
D1-2337	 Hydrogen peroxide, a compound with the formula H2O2, is a potent oxidizing agent and a common household item. It's colorless and odorless, and it decomposes into water and oxygen when exposed to heat or catalysts like iron. This decomposition is the basis for many of its applications, such as bleaching, sterilizing, and oxidizing metals. In the human body, it’s naturally produced by white blood cells to combat infections. Its unique properties make it an essential component in countless industries, from dentistry to textile manufacturing, and even in rocket fuel production. It's important to handle hydrogen peroxide with care, as it can cause irritation and damage to skin and eyes if not properly diluted or protected against.
D1-2338	In this work, it is suggested that the extremum complexity distribution of a high dimensional dynamical system can be interpreted as a piecewise uniform distribution in the phase space of its accessible states. When these distributions are expressed as one--particle distribution functions, this leads to piecewise exponential functions. It seems plausible to use these distributions in some systems out of equilibrium, thus greatly simplifying their description. In particular, here we study an isolated ideal monodimensional gas far from equilibrium that presents an energy distribution formed by two non--overlapping Gaussian distribution functions. This is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Also, some previous laboratory experiments with granular systems seem to display this kind of distributions.
D1-2339	 In the realm of chemistry, the intriguing compound known as silicon dioxide, or silica, plays a pivotal role. Found abundantly in sand and quartz, it forms the backbone of the earth's crust. Silica's unique molecular structure, a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen and silicon atoms, lends it exceptional properties. It's hard, resistant to heat, and chemically inert, making it an essential component in various industries, from glass manufacturing to electronics. Furthermore, its microscopic form, silica gel, is a desiccant, effectively absorbing moisture to preserve delicate items. Indeed, silica's versatility and ubiquity in our daily lives underscores its significant role in the world of chemistry.
D1-2340	Using spin 1/2 particle elastic scattering on a fixed target, in a 1/|x| potential on Euclidean metric, a minimum scattering cross section appears from the spin contribution. Interpreted as semi-classical limit of an earlier proposed operator formulation of four dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, using non-associative complex octonion algebra, this is understood as an area quantum for the observation: Existence of finite (quantized) charges yields a minimum area element of interaction. This suggests that models built on the fundamental assumption of a quantized area element (namely as in Loop Quantum Gravity) may in principle approximate General Relativity in the non-quantum limit.
D1-2341	 In the captivating world of chemistry, the synthesis of polymers holds a pivotal role. These long-chain macromolecules, born from the reaction of monomers, exhibit a remarkable versatility that permeates numerous aspects of our daily lives. From the resilient plastics that encircle our electronic devices, to the elastic fibers in our athletic shoes, polymers are the silent heroes, their structure finely tuned to meet specific functional demands. The art of polymer synthesis, therefore, is not just a scientific pursuit. it's a testament to human ingenuity, a testament to our relentless quest to shape and mold matter to our needs, all while treading the delicate balance between strength and flexibility, durability and malleability.
D1-2342	The use of data assimilation technique to identify optimal topography is discussed in frames of time-dependent motion governed by non-linear barotropic ocean model. Assimilation of artificially generated data allows to measure the influence of various error sources and to classify the impact of noise that is present in observational data and model parameters. The choice of assimilation window is discussed. Assimilating noisy data with longer windows provides higher accuracy of identified topography. The topography identified once by data assimilation can be successfully used for other model runs that start from other initial conditions and are situated in other parts of the model's attractor.
D1-2343	 In the realm of chemical interactions, the intriguing phenomenon of electrolysis unfolds. This process, often harnessed for practical purposes such as water decomposition, is rooted in the movement of electric charge. When an electric current is passed through a substance dissolved in a polar solvent, like water, it splits into ions. These ions, attracted by the electric field, migrate towards the oppositely charged electrodes, undergoing a series of reactions that can result in the production of hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. The efficiency of electrolysis is influenced by factors such as the concentration of the electrolyte, the temperature, and the voltage applied, making it a dynamic and adaptable process in the world of chemistry.
D1-2344	We investigate the role of electrothermal feedback in the operation of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). It is found that the desired mode of operation for SNSPDs is only achieved if this feedback is unstable, which happens naturally through the slow electrical response associated with their relatively large kinetic inductance. If this response is sped up in an effort to increase the device count rate, the electrothermal feedback becomes stable and results in an effect known as latching, where the device is locked in a resistive state and can no longer detect photons. We present a set of experiments which elucidate this effect, and a simple model which quantitatively explains the results.
D1-2345	 Nestled within the vast realm of matter, alkali metals stand as the first column of the periodic table, their symbolic representation adorning its leftmost corner. Known for their high reactivity, alkali metals include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. Their atomic structures, characterized by a single, loose electron in the outermost energy level, predispose them to forge bonds readily. This propensity for reactivity stems from their eagerness to lose this electron, granting them a unified ionic identity and a shared affinity for water. When immersed, they rapidly displace hydrogen, forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen gas in a process reminiscent of a fizzing soda. Their unique properties, coupled with their wide-ranging applications in industries such as batteries, medicine, and electronics, make alkali metals an essential and captivating cornerstone of the periodic table's chemical tapestry.
D1-2346	A detailed experimental study of antiphase dynamics in a two-mode semiconductor laser with optical injection is presented. The device is a specially designed Fabry-Perot laser that supports two primary modes with a THz frequency spacing. Injection in one of the primary modes of the device leads to a rich variety of single and two-mode dynamical scenarios, which are reproduced with remarkable accuracy by a four dimensional rate equation model. Numerical bifurcation analysis reveals the importance of torus bifurcations in mediating transitions to antiphase dynamics and of saddle-node of limit cycle bifurcations in switching of the dynamics between single and two-mode regimes.
D1-2347	 In the realm of chemistry, the intriguing world of polymers unfolds. These complex molecules, made up of repeating monomer units, exhibit remarkable properties due to their vast size and structure. Polymers are the building blocks of countless everyday items, from plastics and rubbers to fibers and resins. Their versatility stems from the variety of monomers available, each imbuing the resulting polymer with unique characteristics. For instance, the addition of vinyl chloride monomers yields polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a durable and flexible material commonly used in pipes and electrical insulation. Similarly, polyethylene, derived from ethylene, is a lightweight, strong plastic essential for packaging and containers. In the ongoing quest for innovative materials, the study of polymers continues to captivate chemists and engineers alike, promising a future brimming with technological advancements.
D1-2348	We analyze the global temperature change due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption using a simple two-layer model of the atmosphere and surface to obtain results consistent with satellite data. Through analytic and numerical analysis we find a principal characteristic response time of 5 to 8 months and a climate sensitivity of 0.17 to 0.20 C/(W/m^2), corresponding to a negative instantaneous feedback. Our solutions were fit to the data, reproducing the results of a one-box model, and providing somewhat more detailed information about the feedbacks related to surface layer temperature. The formalism for coupling of the surface layer to the thermocline is set up but not applied.
D1-2349	 In the realm of chemical reactions, the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid, more commonly known as aspirin, is a testament to human ingenuity. This versatile compound, derived from acetic acid and salicylic acid, is a prime example of esterification. The process begins with the reaction of acetic anhydride and salicylic acid in the presence of a catalyst, typically pyridine, to form acetylsalicylic acid. This reaction is significant not only for its prevalence in over-the-counter pain relievers but also for its role in the development of more complex pharmaceuticals. The transformation of simple, abundant compounds like acetic acid and salicylic acid into aspirin highlights the power of chemistry to improve human health and well-being.
D1-2350	We recently reported the formation of ultracold LiCs molecules in the rovibrational ground state X1Sigma+,v''=0,J''=0 [J. Deiglmayr et al., PRL 101, 133004 (2008)]. Here we discuss details of the experimental setup and present a thorough analysis of the photoassociation step including the photoassociation line shape. We predict the distribution of produced ground state molecules using accurate potential nergy curves combined with an ab-initio dipole transition moment and compare this prediction with experimental ionization spectra. Additionally we improve the value of the dissociation energy for the X1Sigma+ state by high resolution spectroscopy of the vibrational ground state.
D1-2351	 In the realm of chemical catalysis, enzymes stand as nature's most efficient catalysts, ensuring life's intricate biochemical reactions proceed at optimal speeds. These protein molecules, intricately folded into precise three-dimensional structures, actively participate in chemical transformations, lowering activation energies and accelerating reaction rates. Enzymes exhibit an extraordinary level of specificity, each one designed to catalyze a particular reaction, much like lock-and-key interactions. This specificity is achieved through complementary shapes between the enzyme's active site and the substrate, ensuring a perfect fit and efficient catalysis. This remarkable efficiency is essential for maintaining the delicate balance of life's myriad chemical processes.
D1-2352	Scholars, advertisers and political activists see massive online social networks as a representation of social interactions that can be used to study the propagation of ideas, social bond dynamics and viral marketing, among others. But the linked structures of social networks do not reveal actual interactions among people. Scarcity of attention and the daily rythms of life and work makes people default to interacting with those few that matter and that reciprocate their attention. A study of social interactions within Twitter reveals that the driver of usage is a sparse and hidden network of connections underlying the declared set of friends and followers.
D1-2353	 In the fascinating realm of chemistry, we delve into the intricate dance of elements, compounds, and reactions. One captivating example is the synthesis of water, a fundamental substance essential for life. Through the union of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, a process known as electrolysis, water can be split and then recombined, harnessing energy to fuel this chemical symphony. This transformation underscores the profound impact chemistry has on our world, not only in sustaining life but also in unlocking technologies that shape the future, such as renewable energy and advanced materials. Each chemical reaction, like the synthesis of water, is a testament to the beauty and power hidden within the periodic table.
D1-2354	We investigate the evolutionary dynamics in directed and/or weighted networks. We study the fixation probability of a mutant in finite populations in stochastic voter-type dynamics for several update rules. The fixation probability is defined as the probability of a newly introduced mutant in a wild-type population taking over the entire population. In contrast to the case of undirected and unweighted networks, the fixation probability of a mutant in directed networks is characterized not only by the degree of the node that the mutant initially invades but by the global structure of networks. Consequently, the gross connectivity of networks such as small-world property or modularity has a major impact on the fixation probability.
D1-2355	 In the intricate world of chemistry, the elemental dance of hydrogen and oxygen never ceases to amaze. A simple fusion of these two elements, under the right conditions, gives birth to water, a life-sustaining elixir that quenches thirst and supports countless biological processes. Beyond its utility, water's unique properties, such as its high heat capacity and surface tension, have allowed it to shape the Earth's climate and geology over millennia. Moreover, the hydrogen bond, a weak intermolecular force unique to water, contributes to its unusual liquid state, allowing it to exist as a liquid at temperatures well below its boiling point. The chemistry of water, a humble compound, underscores the extraordinary power that lies within the periodic table.
D1-2356	We discuss the use of a Langevin equation with a colored (correlated) noise to perform constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Since the equations of motion are linear in nature, it is easy to predict the response of a Hamiltonian system to such a thermostat and to tune at will the relaxation time of modes of different frequency. This allows one to optimize the time needed to thermalize the system and generate independent configurations. We show how this frequency-dependent response can be exploited to control the temperature of Car-Parrinello-like dynamics, keeping at low temperature the electronic degrees of freedom, without affecting the adiabatic separation from the vibrations of the ions.
D1-2357	 Nestled within the intricate dance of atomic bonds, the realm of organic chemistry unfolds. This discipline delves into the synthesis and properties of carbon-based compounds, from the simple, like methane, to the complex, such as proteins and DNA. Within this realm, chemists weave the threads of life, creating new substances, analyzing their structures, and unraveling their secrets. The art of organic chemistry is a delicate balance, a dance between creativity and logic, where the creation of new molecules can revolutionize industries, medicine, and our understanding of the natural world. It's a dance that continues, evolving, as chemists push the boundaries of what's possible, revealing the hidden beauty within the intricate choreography of carbon compounds.
D1-2358	In this note we present a mathematical framework for a rigorous approach to a common track fit for trackers located in the inner region of the ZEUS detector. The approach makes use of the Kalman filter and offers a rigorous treatment of magnetic field inhomogeneity, multiple scattering and energy loss. We describe mathematical details of the implementation of the Kalman filter technique with a reduced amount of computations for a cylindrical drift chamber, barrel and forward silicon strip detectors and a forward straw drift chamber. Options with homogeneous and inhomogeneous field are discussed. The fitting of tracks in one ZEUS event takes about of 20ms on standard PC.
D1-2359	 In the realm of chemical bonds, polar covalent bonds stand out as a fascinating manifestation of atomic interactions. Unlike ionic bonds, where electrons are wholly transferred, polar covalent bonds share electrons unevenly, creating a separation of charge. This polarization arises from differences in electronegativity between bonded atoms, with the more electronegative atom attracting electrons more strongly. As a result, the bond dipole is formed, which can interact with other dipoles, leading to complex molecular structures and properties. These bonds are essential in various compounds, including water, where they contribute to its unique properties like high boiling point and polarity. In essence, polar covalent bonds are a cornerstone of chemistry, enabling the existence of diverse molecules and the chemistry of life.
D1-2360	"We present two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for precision studies of atomic properties of excited states. The bi-colored technique addresses a narrow set of velocity groups of a thermal atomic vapour using a two-step transition to ""burn a hole"" in the velocity distribution. The resulting spectrum presents sub-Doppler linewidths, good signal to noise ratio and the trademark sidebands that work as an in situ ruler for the energy spacing between atomic resonances. The spectra obtained can be used for different applications such as measurements of energy splittings or stabilization of laser frequencies to excited atomic transitions."
D1-2361	 In the intricate world of chemistry, the element carbon stands out, forming the backbone of life. Carbon's unique ability to form strong, stable bonds with itself and other elements, while maintaining a small, versatile structure, enables it to create an astonishing variety of compounds. From the complex molecules in DNA, the building blocks of life, to the vibrant pigments in a sunset, carbon's influence is omnipresent. Inorganic carbon, found in mineral forms like limestone and diamonds, has shaped our planet's geology and industry. The carbon cycle, a continuous exchange of carbon between the Earth, atmosphere, and life, is a testament to its integral role in our ecosystem. Indeed, carbon's diverse and dynamic nature continues to captivate scientists, fueling research and discovery in countless fields.
D1-2362	The electroweak theory contains too many empirical parameters. Most of them are related to the flavor part of particle physics. In this paper we discuss a relevant simple idea: the complicated system of actual dimensionless, small versus large, quantities in elementary particle flavor phenomenology is small deviated from an explicitly defined benchmark flavor pattern with no tuning parameters. One small empirical universal dimensionless parameter measures this deviation. Its possible physical connections are discussed. As inferences, quasi-degenerate neutrino type with mass scale m = 0.16-0.18 eV, neutrino and quark mixing matrices, large neutrino oscillation 3-flavor hierarchy and quark-neutrino complementarity are predicted.
D1-2363	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and halogens forms ionic compounds. For instance, when hydrogen combines with chlorine, an electron from the hydrogen atom is transferred to the chlorine atom, resulting in H+ and Cl-. This ionic bond, characterized by the attraction of oppositely charged ions, forms common salt (sodium chloride) in the case of sodium and chlorine. Conversely, when hydrogen bonds with oxygen in water, a covalent bond occurs, with both atoms sharing electrons. This crucial bond is essential for life on Earth, enabling a myriad of chemical reactions within organisms.
D1-2364	Reduced equations that describe low-frequency plasma dynamics play an important role in our understanding of plasma behavior over long time scales. One of the oldest paradigms for reduced plasma dynamics involves the ponderomotive Hamiltonian formulation of the oscillation-center dynamics of charged particles (over slow space-time scales) in a weakly-nonuniform background plasma perturbed by an electromagnetic field with fast space-time scales. These reduced plasma equations are derived here by Lie-transform and variational methods for the case of a weakly-magnetized background plasma. In particular, both methods are used to derive explicit expressions for the ponderomotive polarization and magnetization, which appear in the oscillation-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations.
D1-2365	 Nitrogen, a versatile element in the periodic table, is predominantly found in Earth's atmosphere as diatomic N2 gas. This inert gas plays a pivotal role in life, serving as a key component of proteins, nucleic acids, and various biological compounds. In industry, nitrogen is indispensable for the production of fertilizers, plastics, and explosives. Its role in cryogenics is equally significant, where liquid nitrogen is used for cooling and preserving sensitive materials, such as biological samples and superconducting magnets. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation, the process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, is a crucial agricultural practice. Whether in the sky, soil, or laboratory, the chemical wonders of nitrogen continue to shape our world.
D1-2366	We propose a simple model of cytochrome c oxidase, including four redox centers and four protonable sites, to study the time evolution of electrostatically coupled electron and proton transfers initiated by the injection of a single electron into the enzyme. We derive a system of master equations for electron and proton state probabilities and show that an efficient pumping of protons across the membrane can be obtained for a reasonable set of parameters. All four experimentally observed kinetic phases appear naturally from our model. We also calculate the dependence of the pumping efficiency on the transmembrane voltage at different temperatures and discuss a possible mechanism of the redox-driven proton translocation.
D1-2367	 In the intricate realm of chemistry, the concept of electrolysis unfolds. This process, driven by an electric current, splits compounds into simpler substances. For instance, water molecules (H2O) are broken down into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gas in a classic electrolysis demonstration. The electrodes, typically made of platinum, are submerged in an electrolyte solution. The cathode attracts hydrogen ions (H+), gaining electrons to form hydrogen gas, while the anode releases electrons and combines with water to form oxygen gas. This fundamental process underlies numerous industrial applications, like refining metals and producing chlorine for disinfectants.
D1-2368	The propagation of pulses through waveguides with subwavelength features, inhomogeneous transverse structure, and high index contrast cannot be described accurately using existing models in the presence of nonlinear effects. Here we report the development of a generalised full vectorial model of nonlinear pulse propagation and demonstrate that, unlike the standard pulse propagation formulation, the z-component of guided modes plays a key role for these new structures, and results in generalised definitions of the nonlinear coefficient $\gamma,$ $A_{eff}$, and mode orthognality.

D1-2372	The quasiclassical correction to the Moliere's formula for multiple scattering is derived. The consideration is based on the scattering amplitude, obtained with the first quasiclassical correction taken into account for arbitrary localized but not spherically symmetric potential. Unlike the leading term, the correction to the Moliere's formula contains the target density $n$ and thickness $L$ not only in the combination $nL$ (areal density). Therefore, this correction can be reffered to as the bulk density correction. It turns out that the bulk density correction is small even for high density. This result explains the wide region of applicability of the Moliere's formula.

Polarity, in essence, determines a molecule's ability to dissolve in water, a crucial aspect in various chemical processes. Polar molecules, like water and ammonia, possess an uneven distribution of electrons, creating a partial positive and negative charge. Conversely, nonpolar molecules, such as oil and methane, have an even distribution of electrons, making them insoluble in water. This polarity characteristic plays a pivotal role in chemical reactions, solubility, and intermolecular forces, significantly shaping our understanding and manipulation of substances at a molecular level.

A pulsed atom laser is output-coupled from a Bose-Einstein condensate and propagates through a sequence of two internal state beam splitters, realized via coherent Raman transitions between the two interfering states. We observe Ramsey fringes with a visibility close to 100% and determine the current and the potentially achievable interferometric phase sensitivity. This system is well suited to testing recent proposals for generating and detecting squeezed atomic states.

It forms the basis of organic compounds, their structures dictated by the unique tetrahedral geometry of carbon's electron configuration. Carbon-carbon bonds, with their comparatively weak strength, allow for the creation of complex, interconnected structures, as seen in the intricate networks of hydrocarbons. The ability of carbon to bond with various elements, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, expands its role, contributing to the vast array of substances essential to life, from sugars and fats to proteins and nucleic acids. This versatility, combined with carbon's abundant availability, makes it an indispensable element in the realm of chemistry and beyond.
D1-2376	A dissipation rate, which grows faster than any power of the wave number in Fourier space, may be scaled to lead a hydrodynamic system {\it actually} or {\it potentially} converge to its Galerkin truncation. Actual convergence we name for the asymptotic truncation at a finite wavenumber $k_G$ above which modes have no dynamics. and, we define potential convergence for the truncation at $k_G$ which, however, grows without bound. Both types of convergence can be obtained with the dissipation rate $\mu[cosh(k/k_c)-1]$ who behaves as $k^2$ (newtonian) and $\exp\{k/k_c\}$ for small and large $k/k_c$ respectively. Competition physics of cascade, thermalization and dissipation are discussed with numerical Navier-Stokes turbulence, emphasizing on the intermittency growth.

D1-2380	In a previous work a procedure was decribed for dividing the $3 \times N$-dimensional conformational space of a molecular system into a number of discrete cells, this partition allowed the building of a combinatorial structure from data sampled in molecular dynamics trajectories: the graph of cells or G, encoding the set of cells in conformational space that are visited by the system in its thermal wandering. The information in G however, is encoded in a great number of fragments that must be aggregated. We describe here the algorithmic procedures 1) for aggregating the information from G into an hypergraph allowing to enumerate the relevant cells from conformational space, and 2) for puttting the data in a very compact format.
D1-2381	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity differences between elements play a pivotal role in determining the nature of a bond. For instance, when fluorine, an element with a high electronegativity value, combines with a hydrogen atom, it pulls the shared electron pair towards itself, forming a highly polar covalent bond. This polarization, in turn, gives rise to the hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule's dipole moment, making it a powerful, acidic substance. Conversely, when two hydrogen atoms bond with an oxygen atom, forming water (H2O), the electronegativity values are more balanced, resulting in a non-polar covalent bond. This equilibrium contributes to the unique properties of water, such as its high boiling point and its role as a universal solvent. The interplay between electronegativity and bonding is a fascinating aspect of chemistry, shaping the properties and behaviors of countless compounds.
D1-2382	"We formulate a spectral graph-partitioning algorithm that uses the two leading eigenvectors of the matrix corresponding to a selected quality function to split a network into three communities in a single step. In so doing, we extend the recursive bipartitioning methods developed by Newman [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 103, 8577 (2006). Phys. Rev. E 74, 036104 (2006)] to allow one to consider the best available two-way and three-way divisions at each recursive step. We illustrate the method using simple ""bucket brigade"" examples and then apply the algorithm to examine the community structures of the coauthorship graph of network scientists and of U. S. Congressional networks inferred from roll-call voting similarities."

We study paired states of spin-imbalanced ultracold atomic system of fermions with attractive short-range interactions in one-dimensional traps. Calculations are done using the Bethe Ansatz technique and the trap is incorporated into the solution via a local density approximation. The thermodynamic-Bethe-Ansatz equations are solved numerically and different local density profiles are calculated for zero and finite temperatures. A procedure to identify the homogeneous-system phase diagram using local density profiles in the trap is also proposed. Such scheme would be immediately useful for the experiments.

D1-2386	Aerodynamic models are developed to describe coherent structures and transport processes in hurricanes moving over open seas. The models consist of the lower boundary layer and upper adiabatic layer. Except friction at the air/sea interface,proposed modeling avoids the common turbulent approximations while using explicitly or implicitly basic stability constraints. The models analyze dynamics of upper hurricane adiabatic layer, dynamics and transport processes in hurricane boundary layer, and genesis and maturing of hurricane. The proposed modeling provides a rude enough but consistent analytical description of basic processes in hurricanes. The present paper qualitatively describes the model of mature hurricane, briefly discusses the basic thermodynamic relations and aerodynamic equations, and establishes the principles of horizontal motion for mature hurricane.
D1-2387	 In the realm of chemical reactions, the catalyst assumes a pivotal role. This unassuming participant, often in minute quantities, drastically alters the pace of a reaction, lowering its activation energy. By doing so, it enables the reaction to proceed at a faster rate, increasing efficiency. Notably, a catalyst does not alter the overall equilibrium or the position of equilibrium, but merely hastens the approach to it. This versatile tool in chemistry is integral to numerous industrial processes, from fuel combustion to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, ensuring speedier, more sustainable, and economical reactions.
D1-2388	Valencia et al. recently claimed that the mass of a Super-Earth (SE) is a sole factor in determining whether a SE is tectonically active or not. However, mass resolving astrometry is unable to discern between a SE and its moons if any. The fact that no exomoons have been discovered yet is rather a matter of instrumentation imperfection at the present, not of physical absence of exomoons. This, with recently discovered relationships between geometric and physical properties in astronomical bodies (Transiting planets. the Earth) makes it impossible to know yet if the Wageners (here constraining) supposition on somehow-tidally caused tectonics holds universally or not also.

D1-2392	"In the context of our recently developed emergent quantum mechanics, and, in particular, based on an assumed sub-quantum thermodynamics, the necessity of energy quantization as originally postulated by Max Planck is explained by means of purely classical physics. Moreover, under the same premises, also the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator is derived. Essentially, Planck's constant h is shown to be indicative of a particle's ""zitterbewegung"" and thus of a fundamental angular momentum. The latter is identified with quantum mechanical spin, a residue of which is thus present even in the non-relativistic Schroedinger theory."

The total decay rate, summing up both exit channels (3s3p)$^{3}$P$_{1}$ and (3s3p)$^{3}$P$_{2}$, yields (196 $\pm$ 10) s$^{-1}$ in excellent agreement with resent relativistic many-body calculations of [S.G. Porsev et al., Phys. Rev. A. \textbf{64}, 012508 (2001)]. The characterization of this decay channel is important as it may limit the performance of quantum optics experiments carried out with this ladder system as well as two-photon cooling experiments currently explored in several groups.
D1-2395	 In the realm of organic chemistry, the study of carbon-based compounds, the concept of functional groups assumes paramount importance. These groups, characterized by distinct atomic arrangements, impart unique chemical behaviors to molecules. For instance, a hydroxyl group (-OH) in an alcohol molecule can undergo dehydration reactions, yielding aldehydes or ketones. Similarly, the carboxyl group (-COOH) in an acid is involved in acid-base reactions, donating a proton to a base. The amino group (-NH2) in an amine, on the other hand, can act as a base, accepting a proton from an acid. Thus, these functional groups dictate a compound's reactivity and properties, providing a foundation for understanding the vast array of chemical reactions that occur in organic chemistry.

This molecular dance results in materials with unique properties, such as strength, flexibility, and insulation, making them essential for modern technology and innovation. The study of polymers continues to push boundaries, promising a future where these remarkable materials will find even more intricate applications.
D1-2398	The analysis of the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient of aggregating red blood cells reveals information about blood structural properties. The difficulty to apply this technique in vivo is due to the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by intervening tissue layers that distorts the spectral content of backscattering properties from blood microstructures. An optimization method is proposed to simultaneously estimate tissue attenuation and blood structure factor. In an in vitro experiment, the method gave satisfactory estimates with relative errors below 22% for attenuations between 0.101 and 0.317 dB/cm/MHz, signal-to-noise ratios>28 dB and kR<2.7 (k being the wave number and R the aggregate radius).

D1-2400	We have investigated the collisional properties of 41K atoms at ultracold temperature. To show the possibility to use 41K as a coolant, a Bose-Einstein condensate of 41K atoms in the stretched state (F=2, m_F=2) was created for the first time by direct evaporation in a magnetic trap. An upper bound of three body loss coefficient for atoms in the condensate was determined to be 4(2) 10^{-29} cm -6 s-1.

The return intervals are short-term and long-term correlated and possess multifractal nature. The Hurst index of the return intervals decays exponentially against $R_Q$, predicting that rare extreme events with $R_Q\to\infty$ are also long-term correlated with the Hurst index $H_\infty=0.639$.

The metamaterial consists of two closely spaced split ring resonators that have their gaps in non-identical positions within the ring. For normal incidence and a fixed polarization both lowest order eigenmodes of the split ring resonators can be excited. although one of them has to be regarded as dark since coupling is prohibited because of symmetry constraints.

In this work we investigate its statistical properties by employing phenomenological heuristic arguments, in combination with Sabra shell model simulations of the analogue of the NSV model. For large values of the regularizing parameter, compared to the Kolmogorov length scale, simulations exhibit multiscaling inertial range, and the dissipation range displaying low intermittency.

Parallel flows with $\theta=0$ are slightly more unstable than anti-parallel ones with $\theta=\pi$. The case $\theta=\pi/2$ is as unstable as the $\theta=0$ one, but the fastest growing modes are oblique. While the most unstable wave vector varies with orientation, its growth rate slightly evolves and there is no such thing as a stable configuration. A number of exact results can be derived, especially for the $\theta=\pi/2$ case.

In particular, we use a cellular automata model to simulate the motion of vehicles along streets, coupled with a congestion-aware routing at street crossings. Such routing makes use of the knowledge of agents about traffic in nearby roads and allows the vehicles to dynamically update the routes towards their destinations. By implementing the model in real urban street patterns of various cities, we show that it is possible to achieve a global traffic optimization based on local agent decisions.

D1-2424	A self-focusing of a coasting relativistic beam in a plasma channel that is confined by an external magnetic field is studied as a means of reconditioning the beam emerging from a beam injector [a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ)] for a linac. A detailed study of the beam stability in the self-focused beam has been carried out. In order to explain beam filaments and the resistive hose instability in a unified way, we treat all the azimuthal modes in the derivation of the dispersion relation in a finite plasma channel that exhibit many unstable modes, which are classified by Weinberg's scheme [Steven Weinberg, J. Math. 8, 614 (1967)].

D1-2426	"The credit crisis roiling the world's financial markets will likely take years and entire careers to fully understand and analyze. A short empirical investigation of the current trends, however, demonstrates that the losses in certain markets, in this case the US equity markets, follow a cascade or epidemic flow like model along the correlations of various stocks. This phenomenon will be shown by the graphical display of stock returns across the network as well as the dependence of stock returns on topological measures. Finally, whether the idea of ""epidemic"" or a ""cascade"" is a metaphor or model for this crisis will be discussed."

D1-2428	By using the Renyi entropy, and following the same scheme that in the Fisher-Renyi entropy product case, a generalized statistical complexity is defined. Several properties of it, including inequalities and lower and upper bounds are derived. The hydrogen atom is used as a test system where to quantify these two different statistical magnitudes, the Fisher-Renyi entropy product and the generalized statistical complexity. For each level of energy, both indicators take their minimum values on the orbitals that correspond to the highest orbital angular momentum. Hence, in the same way as happens with the Fisher-Shannon and the statistical complexity, these generalized Renyi-like statistical magnitudes break the energy degeneration in the H-atom.
D1-2429	 Amidst the intricate dance of atoms, chemistry unfolds, weaving a tapestry of compounds that govern our world. From the fiery fusion in the sun, to the delicate balance of life's building blocks, chemistry is an omnipresent force.

To achieve the necessary loop gain a 300 element series array SQUID is constructed from three monolithic 100-element series arrays. A feedback resistor completes the loop from the SQUID output to the input coil. The short feedback path of this Linearized SQUID Array (LISA) allows for a substantially larger flux-locked loop bandwidth as compared to a SQUID flux-locked loop that includes a room temperature amplifier.

D1-2432	All the relativistic cosmological models of the universe, except Einstein's static model, imply that the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe is also expanding apart from the matter and the radiation in it. However, there is no observational evidence of the expansion of the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe. Actually, the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe might not be expanding at all. Consequently, the conceptual foundation of the relativistic cosmological models of the universe based on the general theory of relativity, which in turn is based on Riemannian geometry, might be faulty and misleading.
D1-2433	 In the realm of chemical reactions, the fascinating dance of atoms never ceases. Catalysts, silent spectators, speed up the pace of these dances, lowering reaction energies and making processes more efficient. They are like temporary dance partners, allowing reactions to unfold swiftly without altering the final outcome. In the vast panorama of chemistry, catalysts play a pivotal role, propelling the conversion of one substance into another, and thereby shaping the world around us. From the production of everyday items to the purification of air and water, catalysts are the unseen heroes, orchestrating the intricate ballet of chemical change.

With increasing rotation and large enough Rayleigh number an abrupt transition from a turbulent state with nearly rotation-independent heat transport to another turbulent state with enhanced heat transfer is observed at a critical inverse Rossby number $1/Ro_c \simeq 0.4$. Whereas for $1/Ro < 1/Ro_c$ the strength of the large-scale convection-roll is either enhanced or essentially unmodified depending on parameters, its strength is increasingly diminished beyond $1/Ro_c$ where it competes with Ekman vortices that cause vertical fluid transport and thus heat-transfer enhancement.
D1-2435	 In the realm of chemistry, the intriguing concept of polymers reigns supreme. These complex molecules, consisting of repeating subunits, are engineered marvels that have reshaped numerous industries. From the flexible plastics wrapping your groceries to the robust fibers in your clothing, polymers permeate our daily lives.

The versatility of polymers allows for their tailoring to specific applications, making them indispensable in modern technology and manufacturing. Their continued evolution holds immense potential for addressing global challenges, such as sustainable energy storage and biocompatible materials for medicine.
D1-2436	We study the behavior of self-propelled nano- and micro-rods in three dimensions, confined between two parallel walls, by simulations and scaling arguments. Our simulations include thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions, which are both relevant for the dynamical behavior at nano- to micrometer length scales. In order to investigate the importance hydrodynamic interactions, we also perform Brownian-dynamics-like simulations. In both cases, we find that self-propelled rods display a strong surface excess in confined geometries. An analogy with semi-flexible polymers is employed to derive scaling laws for the dependence on the wall distance, the rod length, and the propulsive force. The simulation data confirm the scaling predictions.
D1-2437	 In the intricate world of chemistry, the element carbon stands out for its versatility, forming the basis of countless organic compounds. Carbon's unique property of catenation, or the ability to form strong bonds with other carbon atoms, allows it to create complex structures. This feature is exemplified in the creation of polymers, materials that are essential to our daily lives, from plastics to fibers. Furthermore, carbon's ability to form multiple covalent bonds, including triple bonds, results in a wide array of molecules, including the life-sustaining carbon dioxide and the energy-storing molecule, glucose. The study of carbon and its properties continues to fuel our understanding and exploration in the realm of chemistry.
D1-2438	We explore the potential energy surfaces for NH molecules interacting with alkali-metal and alkaline-earth atoms using highly correlated ab-initio electronic structure calculations. The surfaces for interaction with alkali-metal atoms have deep wells dominated by covalent forces. The resulting strong anisotropies will produce strongly inelastic collisions. The surfaces for interaction with alkaline-earth atoms have shallower wells that are dominated by induction and dispersion forces. For Be and Mg the anisotropy is small compared to the rotational constant of NH, so that collisions will be relatively weakly inelastic. Be and Mg are thus promising coolants for sympathetic cooling of NH to the ultracold regime.
D1-2439	 In the intricate realm of chemistry, the fascinating dance of elements and compounds unfolds. Silicon, a versatile non-metal, is one such element that plays a crucial role in our modern world. It's the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, primarily found in sand and silica.

D1-2440	We investigate electron-positron pair production from vacuum for short laser pulses with sub-cycle structure, in the nonperturbative regime (Schwinger pair production). We use the non-equilibrium quantum kinetic approach, and show that the momentum spectrum of the created electron-positron pairs is extremely sensitive to the sub-cycle dynamics -- depending on the laser frequency $\omega$, the pulse length $\tau$, and the carrier phase $\phi$ -- and shows several distinctive new signatures. This observation could help not only in the design of laser pulses to optimize the experimental signature of Schwinger pair production, but also ultimately lead to new probes of light pulses at extremely short time scales.

In its elemental form, it is an inert, colorless, odorless, and non-reactive gas. However, when combined with other elements, it forms a myriad of compounds essential to various biological processes and industrial applications. Nitrogen-containing molecules like ammonia (NH3), nitric acid (HNO3), and proteins play crucial roles in agriculture, medicine, and energy production. The nitrogen cycle, a series of chemical processes that convert nitrogen between its various forms, is a fundamental aspect of Earth's biogeochemical cycles, ensuring the continuous availability of this vital element for life.
D1-2442	In this paper, we study the effects of introducing contrarians in a model of Opinion Dynamics where the agents have internal continuous opinions, but exchange information only about a binary choice that is a function of their continuous opinion, the CODA model. We observe that the hung election scenario still exists here, but it is weaker and it shouldn't be expected in every election. Finally, we also show that the introduction of contrarians make the tendency towards extremism of the original model weaker, indicating that the existence of agents that prefer to disagree might be an important aspect and help society to diminish extremist opinions.

Its ability to bond with itself and other elements, forming stable, yet diverse structures, is the key to its dominance in the periodic table. This versatility, when harnessed, can lead to revolutionary advancements in various fields, from medicine to materials science. The ever-evolving study of carbon and its compounds continues to captivate scientists, promising a myriad of discoveries yet to come.
D1-2446	Generalizing results of our previous work (where classical kinetic energy has been used) in this work (where ultra-relativistic kinetic energy is used) we suggest an original variant of the determination of minimal length (corresponding to Plank length) by formation of a microscopic (tiny) black hole. Like to some previous authors we use Heisenberg coordinate-momentum uncertainty relation, on the one hand. But, instead of metric fluctuation (obtained by second derivative in Einstein equations) that generalizes uncertainty relation by an additional term, used by previous authors, we use Hawking temperature of the black hole and standard Heisenberg coordinate-momentum uncertainty relation.
D1-2447	 In the realm of molecular magic, the chemistry of polymers unfolds a captivating tale. Polymers, the macromolecules built from repeating subunits, are the backbone of countless everyday objects, from rugged plastics to elastic rubber. Their properties, dictated by the sequence and arrangement of these subunits, can be tailored to serve diverse purposes. For instance, polyethylene, a linear polymer, is prized for its strong, lightweight structure, while polyvinyl chloride, a more complex polymer, offers flexibility and durability. The art of polymer chemistry is a testament to the dynamic nature of matter, where the simple union of atoms can give rise to a myriad of practical applications, shaping our world in ways both subtle and profound.

The fluctuations of the electrical resistance during exposure to different bacterial odors, Escherichia coli and anthrax-surrogate Bacillus subtilis, have been measured and analyzed. In the present study, the simplest method, the measurement and analysis of power density spectra was used. The sensors were run in the normal heated and the sampling-and-hold working modes, respectively. The results indicate that Taguchi sensors used in these fluctuation-enhanced modes are effective tools of bacterium detection and identification even when they are utilizing only the power density spectrum of the stochastic sensor signal.
D1-2449	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the fascination lies in the intricate dance between atoms. Ionic bonds, forged from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions, illuminate the chemistry of salt crystals. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, form when two atoms share electrons, as seen in water (H2O) and methane (CH4). The strong and stable nature of these bonds is crucial to life, from the water we drink to the molecules that make up our DNA. Yet, chemistry is not limited to these fundamental interactions. Polymers, for instance, are large molecules composed of repeating subunits, playing a vital role in diverse applications, from plastics to biology. The beauty of chemistry lies in its ability to explain the world around us, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, and in its endless potential for innovation.
D1-2450	We have recently started to investigate 2D arrays of confocal lens pairs. Miniaturization of the lens pairs can make the array behave ray-optically like a homogeneous medium. Here we generalize the geometry of the lens pairs. These generalisations include a sideways shift of the lens centres and a change in the orientation of both lenses in each pair. We investigate the basic ray optics of the resulting arrays, and illustrate these with movies rendered using ray-tracing software. We suggest that confocal lenslet arrays could be used to realize ray-optically some recent metamaterials concepts such as the coordinate-transform design paradigm.
D1-2451	 Amidst the kaleidoscope of chemical reactions, one stands out as a cornerstone: oxidation-reduction, or redox for short. This process, fundamental to life itself, involves the transfer of electrons from one atom or molecule (the reducer) to another (the oxidizer). The oxidizer gains electrons, becoming reduced, while the reducer loses electrons, oxidizing. This dance of electrons powers countless reactions, from rusting metals to the burning of fuel in a car engine, and even the breakdown of glucose in our cells for energy. Understanding redox reactions opens a window into the very heart of chemical transformations, shedding light on the intricate web of cause and effect that governs the world around us.
D1-2452	Quantum optics with quantum gases represents a new field, where the quantum nature of both light and ultracold matter plays equally important role. Only very recently this ultimate quantum limit of light-matter interaction became feasible experimentally. In traditional quantum optics, the cold atoms are considered classically, whereas, in quantum atom optics, the light is used as an essentially classical axillary tool. On the one hand, the quantization of optical trapping potentials can significantly modify many-body dynamics of atoms, which is well-known only for classical potentials. On the other hand, atomic fluctuations can modify the properties of the scattered light.
D1-2453	 In the captivating realm of chemistry, a pivotal compound known as glucose, or blood sugar, plays a vital role. Derived from carbohydrates, glucose is the primary energy source for our cells. When consumed, it's broken down during digestion into simpler molecules, absorbed into our bloodstream, and transported to cells for conversion into ATP, the universal energy currency of life. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, facilitates this process, allowing glucose to enter cells and lower blood sugar levels. Imbalances in glucose metabolism can lead to disorders such as diabetes, highlighting the significance of this compound in maintaining homeostasis within our bodies.
D1-2454	The problem of the universal form of the size spectrum is analyzed. The half-widths of two wings of spectrum is introduced and it is shown that their ratio is very close to the golden fraction. In appendix it is shown that behind the golden fraction of an image one can find the information basis, i.e. the proportion of the golden fraction corresponds to some method to find extremum. The method to find extrema associated with Fibonacci numbers also leads to proportions which can be seen in nature or can be introduced artificially. The information origin of proportions is proved theoretically and confirmed by examples in nature and human life.
D1-2455	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the concept of an ionic bond is pivotal. Ionic bonds form when a metal loses electrons, forming a cation, and a non-metal gains these electrons, becoming an anion. This electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions holds sodium chloride, table salt, together, for instance. Conversely, covalent bonds, where atoms share electrons, are essential in organic molecules like water (H2O), ethanol (C2H5OH), and glucose (C6H12O6). These bonds are fundamental to the structure and properties of countless substances, shaping the vast and intricate landscape of chemistry.
D1-2456	Sample-to-sample fluctuations of the time-dependent conductance of a system with static disorder have been studied by means of diagrammatic theory and microwave pulsed transmission measurements. The fluctuations of time-dependent conductance are not universal, i.e., depend on sample parameters, in contrast to the universal conductance fluctuations in the steady-state regime. The variance of normalized conductance, determined by the infinite-range intensity correlation C_3(t), is found to increase as a third power of delay time from an exciting pulse, t. C_3(t) grows larger than the long-range intensity correlation C_2(t) after a time t_q ~ <g>^{1/2} t_D (t_D being the diffusion time, <g> being the average dimensionless conductance).
D1-2457	 Amidst the dazzling array of chemical compounds, one stands out for its ubiquity and versatility: water (H2O). It's a simple molecule, yet it plays a pivotal role in virtually every life process. Water is a solvent, dissolving a vast number of substances, facilitating reactions and transporting nutrients in our bodies. It's also a medium for chemical reactions, lowering or raising the temperature at which they occur. In the broader realm of chemistry, water's unique properties make it an essential component in laboratory experiments, industrial processes, and even in our everyday cleaning solutions. Its role as a solvent, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, and its presence in all states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) underscore its profound significance in the realm of chemistry.
D1-2458	"Progress in the theory of anomalous diffusion in weakly turbulent cold magnetized plasmas is explained. Several proposed models advanced in the literature are discussed. Emphasis is put on a new proposed mechanism for anomalous diffusion transport mechanism based on the coupled action of conductive walls (excluding electrodes) bounding the plasma drain current (edge diffusion) together with the magnetic field flux ""cutting"" the area traced by the charged particles in their orbital motion. The same reasoning is shown to apply to the plasma core anomalous diffusion. The proposed mechanism is expected to be valid in regimes when plasma diffusion scales as Bohm diffusion and at high $B/N$, when collisions are of secondary importance."
D1-2459	 In the intricate realm of chemistry, the study of compounds is fundamental. A compound is a substance formed when two or more elements chemically combine. These elements retain their individual identities within the compound, yet their properties are dramatically altered. For instance, sodium and chlorine, when united, form common table salt, a compound essential in human diet. The bond between these elements is ionic, a type of attraction that holds the compound together. Conversely, when hydrogen and oxygen unite, they form water, a covalent compound vital for life. These examples illustrate the versatility of chemistry, where simple elements can combine to create the complex substances that shape our world.
D1-2460	Superconducting NbN wires have recently received attention as detectors for visible and infrared photons. We present experiments in which we use a NbN wire for high-efficiency (40 %) detection of single electrons with keV energy. We use the beam of a scanning electron microscope as a focussed, stable, and calibrated electron source. Scanning the beam over the surface of the wire provides a map of the detection efficiency. This map shows features as small as 150 nm, revealing wire inhomogeneities. The intrinsic resolution of this mapping method, superior to optical methods, provides the basis of a characterization tool relevant for photon detectors.

The Haber-Bosch process, a catalytic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, revolutionized agriculture by providing a sustainable source of nitrogen fertilizers, boosting crop yields significantly. Yet, nitrogen pollution from agricultural runoff and industrial emissions poses environmental concerns, leading to eutrophication and acid rain. The delicate balance between harnessing nitrogen's benefits and managing its impacts remains a vital challenge for sustainable development.
D1-2462	The process of cognition is analysed to adjust the set theory to physical description. Postulates and basic definitions are revised. The specific sets of predicates, called presets, corresponding to the physical objects identified by an observer during cognition are introduced. Unlike sets, the presets are free of logical or set-theoretical paradoxes and may be consistently used in physical description. Schemes of cognition based on presets are considered. Being different logical systems, the relativistic and quantum theories, observations in modern cosmology cannot be consistently considered in one `unified physical theory', but they are in frames of introduced schemes of cognition.

D1-2464	We study oscillation death (OD) in a well-known coupled-oscillator system that has been used to model cardiovascular phenomena. We derive exact analytic conditions that allow the prediction of OD through the two known bifurcation routes, in the same model, and for different numbers of coupled oscillators. Our exact analytic results enable us to generalize OD as a multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can be induced, not only by changes in couplings, but also by changes in the oscillator frequencies or amplitudes. We observe synchronization transitions as a function of coupling and confirm the robustness of the phenomena in the presence of noise. Numerical and analogue simulations are in good agreement with the theory.
D1-2465	 In the realm of chemistry, the fascinating world of polymers unfolds. These complex molecules, composed of repeating monomer units, are ubiquitous in our daily lives.

The design philosophy, current status of the project and its aims are presented in this report.
D1-2467	 In the realm of chemical compounds, water (H2O) stands out as a remarkable substance. Beyond its ubiquity in our daily lives, water's unique property of a high boiling point for its molecular weight is intriguing. This anomaly, known as the hydrogen bond, stems from the partial positive charge of hydrogen atoms and the partial negative charge of oxygen atoms in water molecules. These charges create a network of hydrogen bonds, making water's structure more stable than other substances with similar molecular weights. This characteristic not only influences water's physical properties but also its role in supporting life on Earth, making it an essential component in various chemical reactions and biological processes.
D1-2468	We have calculated parity nonconserving 7s - 6d_{3/2} amplitude E_PNC in 223Ra+ using high-precision relativistic all-order method where all single and double excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders of perturbation theory. Detailed study of the uncertainty of the parity nonconserving (PNC) amplitude is carried out. additional calculations are performed to estimate some of the missing correlation corrections. A systematic study of the parity conserving atomic properties, including the calculation of the energies, transition matrix elements, lifetimes, hyperfine constants, quadrupole moments of the 6d states, as well as dipole and quadrupole ground state polarizabilities, is carried out. The results are compared with other theoretical calculations and available experimental values.
D1-2469	 Nitrogen, the diatomic element with symbol N and atomic number 7, is a vital component in our environment and industrial processes. It constitutes nearly 78% of Earth's atmosphere in the form of diatomic nitrogen gas (N2). This inert gas is crucial for life, as it doesn't react under standard conditions, but is essential for the formation of proteins, DNA, and various other organic compounds. In industry, nitrogen plays a pivotal role as a reducing agent, oxidizing agent, and in the production of ammonia, nitric acid, and explosives. Its versatility and abundance make nitrogen a cornerstone element in chemistry and life on Earth.
D1-2470	We have measured the trapping lifetime of magnetically trapped atoms in a cryogenic atom-chip experiment. An ultracold atomic cloud is kept at a fixed distance from a thin gold layer deposited on top of a superconducting trapping wire. The lifetime is studied as a function of the distances to the surface and to the wire. Different regimes are observed, where loss rate is determined either by the technical current noise in the wire or the Johnson-Nyquist noise in the metallic gold layer, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Far from the surface, we observe exceptionally long trapping times for an atom-chip, in the 10-minutes range.
D1-2471	 In the realm of chemistry, alkali metals, a group on the periodic table, captivate our interest. Their distinctive properties - soft, silvery-white, highly reactive, and able to displace hydrogen in acid - set them apart. Sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium, these five elements, are alkali metals. Their reactivity stems from a single electron in their outermost energy level, yearning to bond, which makes them readily surrender electrons in reactions, often resulting in the production of salts and hydrogen gas. Their ubiquity in everyday life is reflected in their uses, such as in batteries, as a crucial component in sodium lights, and in the manufacturing of soap and glass. Despite their reactivity, alkali metals, with their unique characteristics, continue to intrigue chemists and fuel our understanding of the periodic table.
D1-2472	Mechanical oscillations are important for many cellular processes, e.g. the beating of cilia and flagella or the sensation of sound by hair cells. These dynamic states originate from spontaneous oscillations of molecular motors. A particularly clear example of such oscillations has been observed in muscle fibers under non-physiological conditions. In that case, motor oscillations lead to contraction waves along the fiber. By a macroscopic analysis of muscle fiber dynamics we find that the spontaneous waves involve non-hydrodynamic modes. A simple microscopic model of sarcomere dynamics highlights mechanical aspects of the motor dynamics and fits with the experimental observations.
D1-2473	 Amid the intricate dance of elements, the science of chemistry unfolds a world of wonders. Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are fashioned by the union of atoms, each a tiny solar system with its own nucleus and orbiting electrons. These molecular entities form the building blocks of substances, from the simple water molecule H2O, which quenches our thirst, to the complex proteins that propel life's intricate processes. Chemistry, thus, serves as the bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic, revealing the hidden connections that bind the universe together. It's a testament to the beauty and order inherent in nature, a testament to science's ceaseless quest for understanding.
D1-2474	The epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) tunneling phenomenon allows full transmission of waves through a narrow channel even in the presence of a strong geometric mismatch. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonlinear control of the ENZ tunneling by an external field, as well as self-modulation of the transmission resonance due to the incident wave. Using a waveguide section near cut-off frequency as the ENZ system, we introduce a diode with tunable and nonlinear capacitance to demonstrate both of these effects. Our results confirm earlier theoretical ideas on using an ENZ channel for dielectric sensing, and their potential applications for tunable slow-light structures.
D1-2475	 Nitrogen, an element vital to life, constitutes 78% of Earth's atmosphere. It's a colorless, odorless, and non-reactive gas. In nature, nitrogen is mainly found in the N2 diatomic form. However, when exposed to energy like lightning or industrial processes, it can combine with oxygen to form nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), both key components in air pollution. These compounds contribute to the creation of smog, harming both human health and the environment. On a positive note, nitrogen fixation, a biochemical process converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by organisms, is essential for agriculture, ensuring the growth of crops and maintaining food security worldwide.
D1-2476	This work presents a new Visual Basic 6.0 application for estimating the fractal dimension of images, based on an optimized version of the box-counting algorithm. Following the attempt to separate the real information from noise, we considered also the family of all band-pass filters with the same band-width (specified as parameter). The fractal dimension can be thus represented as a function of the pixel color code.

This additional term is numerically shown to provide fairly negligible effects on the system evolution during phase-separation. To the best of our knowledge, these important properties of the SC model were not noted before. The approach developed in the present work is based on a continuum analysis: further extensions, more in line with a discrete lattice theory (X. Shan, {\it Phys Rev E}, {\bf 77} 066702 (2008)) can be envisaged for the future.

D1-2482	We describe students revising the mathematical form of physics equations to match the physical situation they are describing, even though their revision violates physical laws. In an unfamiliar air resistance problem, a majority of students in a sophomore level mechanics class at some point wrote Newton's Second Law as F = -ma. they were using this form to ensure that the sign of the force pointed in a direction consistent with the chosen coordinate system while assuming that some variables have only positive value. We use one student's detailed explanation to suggest that students' issues with variables are context-dependent, and that much of their reasoning is useful for productive instruction.
D1-2483	 In the intricate realm of chemical bonding, the covalent bond plays a pivotal role. Unlike ionic bonds that form from the transfer of electrons, covalent bonds are created when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. This sharing of electrons results in a stable electron configuration, lowering the overall energy of the molecule. Carbon-carbon bonds, for instance, are covalent, enabling the construction of complex organic structures. Hydrogen bonds, a weaker form of covalent linkage, occur when a hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to a highly electronegative atom, such as nitrogen or oxygen, in another molecule, contributing to the stability and structure of many biological compounds. Thus, covalent bonds, in their versatility and ubiquity, are crucial to the existence of countless substances, from the simplest hydrogen molecule to the most complex proteins.

The wave amplitude distribution follows a power law over a wide range of frequencies. Numerical computations yield results in agreement with the experimental observations. We suggest that second sound cascades of this kind may be useful for model studies of acoustic turbulence.

D1-2489	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electrons are the fundamental players. They weave an intricate dance, leaping from atom to atom, forming and breaking connections that hold molecules together. This harmonious exchange, known as ionic bonding, occurs between metals and non-metals, where one atom donates electrons to another, thus creating ions with a positive and negative charge. These oppositely charged ions then attract each other in a stable arrangement, forming a crystal lattice within the compound. On the other hand, covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms of the same or similar electronegativity. This sharing results in a stable and balanced electron configuration, allowing compounds like water (H2O) and methane (CH4) to maintain their structural integrity. The delicate balance of these chemical bonds shapes the properties of substances, dictating their behavior in various reactions, and ultimately, their role in the grand scheme of chemistry.
D1-2490	Improvement in time resolution sometimes introduces short-range random noises into temporal data sequences. These noises affect the results of power-spectrum analyses and the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The DFA is one of useful methods for analyzing long-range correlations in non-stationary sequences. The effects of noises are discussed based on artificial temporal sequences. Short-range noises prevent power-spectrum analyses from detecting long-range correlations. The DFA can extract long-range correlations from noisy time sequences. The DFA also gives the threshold time length, under which the noises dominate. For practical analyses, coarse-grained time sequences are shown to recover long-range correlations.
D1-2491	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the intriguing phenomenon of covalent bonds plays a pivotal role. These bonds, formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms, are fundamental in the structure of numerous molecules, including water and the DNA building blocks. The strength of a covalent bond is determined by factors such as the electronegativity of the bonded atoms, which dictates the polar or non-polar nature of the bond, and the number of shared electrons. For instance, a double covalent bond, like the one in an oxygen molecule, has four electrons shared between the two atoms, resulting in a stronger bond compared to a single covalent bond. This bonding mechanism, with its flexibility and strength, underpins the very essence of the organic compounds that form the basis of life.

Unlike the fleeting luminescence of fluorescence, phosphorescence emits light for much longer periods. This persistent glow arises from a process called intersystem crossing, which transitions the excited electron from a lower-energy to a higher-energy state. Common materials such as zinc sulfide and diphenyl anthracene demonstrate this phenomenon, their molecules storing energy and gradually releasing it as light. The study of phosphorescence sheds light on intricate energy transfer mechanisms, offering insights into materials design and the development of novel lighting technologies.

We derive a free-space version of these reciprocity relations which generalizes the conservation of the momentum-energy tensor. This relation corresponds to the interference conservation of electromagnetic waves. We show that for any transformation or symmetry that leaves Maxwell's equations invariant, we can modify the reciprocity relation to introduce a conserving density, optical flux and stress tensor extending Noether's theorem to a different context. We apply this method to transformations that can be expressed as Hermitian operators and more specifically we define the operators associated with the optical energy, spin, linear and angular momentum.

Full simulation of the optical system provides insights on the scalability of the system. Such a system can provide a versatile tool for applications where fast laser multiplexing is necessary.
D1-2499	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the intriguing world of covalent bonds unfolds. These bonds, formed when sharing electrons, are fundamental in the structure of molecules. For instance, the oxygen molecule (O2) consists of two oxygen atoms, each with six electrons in their outer shell, seeking stability. They share these electrons, forming a stable double covalent bond and creating O2, a vital component in our atmosphere. Similarly, the hydrogen molecule (H2) is composed of two hydrogen atoms, each with one electron in their outer shell. They pair up, sharing electrons to form a single covalent bond, essential in various chemical reactions and the formation of water (H2O). Covalent bonds, thus, play a crucial role in the dance of atoms, shaping the fabric of our chemical universe.
D1-2500	"In particle-based algorithms, the effect of binary collisions is commonly described in a statistical way, using Monte Carlo techniques. It is shown that, in the relativistic regime, stringent constraints should be considered on the sampling of particle pairs for collision, which are critical to ensure physically meaningful results, and that nonrelativistic sampling criteria (e.g., uniform random pairing) yield qualitatively wrong results, including equilibrium distributions that differ from the theoretical J\""uttner distribution. A general procedure for relativistically consistent algorithms is provided, and verified with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, thus opening the way to the numerical exploration of the statistical properties of collisional relativistic systems."

D1-2502	We study theoretically the rate of spontaneous emission of a two-level quantum emitter embedded in realistic systems: near a mirror, near a plasmonic sphere, or in a 3D photonic bandgap crystal. At constant frequency and position, we find striking (up to $10^{2}\times$) variations in emission rate by varying the orientation of the transition dipole moment. We present a general representation of rate versus orientation that only invokes symmetry of the Green function. The concomitant 3-dimensional geometric surfaces provide much insight in how preferred orientations for enhancement (or inhibition) depend on the emitter's frequency and location, and on optimal strategies to actively switch emission rates by controlling oriented dipoles.
D1-2503	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity scale offers a means to predict the polarity of a bond. Devised by Linus Pauling, this tool ranks elements based on their attraction to electrons, with fluorine as the most electronegative and cesium the least. The difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms determines the degree of ionic or covalent character in a bond, suggesting that a bond between hydrogen and fluorine would be highly polar, while one between helium and neon would be almost non-polar. This knowledge is crucial in understanding the properties and behaviors of various chemical compounds, from the reactivity of acids to the structure of molecules in biology.
D1-2504	The special theory of relativity is the foundation of modern physics, but its unusual postulate of invariant vacuum speed of light results in a number of plausible paradoxes. This situation leads to radical criticisms and suspicions against the theory of relativity. In this paper, from the perspective that the relativity is nothing but a geometry, we give a uniform resolution to some famous and typical paradoxes such as the ladder paradox, the Ehrenfest's rotational disc paradox. The discussion shows that all the paradoxes are caused by misinterpretation of concepts. We misused the global simultaneity and the principle of relativity. As a geometry of Minkowski space-time, special relativity can never result in a logical contradiction.

D1-2508	We study the evolution of networks when the creation and decay of links are based on the position of nodes in the network measured by their centrality. We show that the same network dynamics arises under various centrality measures, and solve analytically the network evolution. During the complete evolution, the network is characterized by nestedness: the neighbourhood of a node is contained in the neighbourhood of the nodes with larger degree. We find a discontinuous transition in the network density between hierarchical and homogeneous networks, depending on the rate of link decay. We also show that this evolution mechanism leads to double power-law degree distributions, with interrelated exponents.

Its molecules consist of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, linked by a strong oxygen-oxygen bond. The unique property of hydrogen peroxide is its ability to decompose, releasing oxygen gas and water, a process accelerated by catalysts like iron or platinum. This decomposition, known as the 'half-life reaction,' makes hydrogen peroxide useful in everything from bleaching laundry to medical applications, such as wound cleaning, due to its antiseptic properties. Moreover, its ability to generate oxygen makes it a vital component in numerous industrial processes, from etching silicon wafers in electronics to fuel cells in hybrid vehicles. Despite its usefulness, it must be handled with care due to its reactivity and potential for explosive decomposition under certain conditions.
D1-2510	The application of quadrupole-devices with high field gradients and small apertures requires precise control over higher order multipole field components. We present a new scheme for performance control and tuning, which allows the illumination of most of the quadrupole-device aperture because of the reduction of higher order field components. Consequently, the size of the aperture can be minimized to match the beam size achieving field gradients of up to 500 T/m at good imaging quality.

This intricate dance of hydrogen bonds underpins the structural and functional properties of water, highlighting its importance in the chemical world.
D1-2512	The first kinetic study of transient growth for a collisionless homogeneous Maxwellian plasma in a uniform magnetic field is presented. A system which is linearly stable may display transient growth if the linear operator describing its evolution is non-normal, so that its eigenvectors are non-orthogonal. In order to include plasma kinetic effects a Landau fluid model is employed. The linear operator of the model is shown to be non-normal and the results suggest that the nonnormality of a collisionless plasma is intrinsically related to its kinetic nature, with the transient growth being more accentuated for smaller scales and higher plasma beta. The results based on linear spectral theory have been confirmed with nonlinear simulations.

D1-2516	In light of some recent experiments on quasi two-dimensional (2D) turbulent channel flow we provide here a model of the ideal case, for the sake of comparison. The ideal 2D channel flow differs from its 3D counterpart by having a second quadratic conserved variable in addition to the energy, and the latter has an inverse rather than a direct cascade. The resulting qualitative differences in profiles of velocity, V, and energy, K, as a function of the distance from the wall are highlighted and explained. The most glaring difference is that the 2D channel is much more energetic, with K in wall units increasing logarithmically with the Reynolds number $\Ret$ instead of being $\Ret$-independent in 3D channels.

D1-2522	"The ultimate active constituents of the living medium, membranes, ions and molecules, are at the level of the nanometer. Their interactions thus require a quantum processing. The characteristic Action A, linked to the ""quantum objects"" : ions, radicals, water molecule... of the living medium, has an average value of A ~= 14.10-34 J.s or A ~= 2 h . It is thus strictly impossible to formulate a realistic ""classical "" theory of membrane electrodynamics. The transfer of the sodium ion - among others - could be then ensured under the action of a Tunnel effect, (with Hartman?s mechanism) specific to the channel and the ion transferred."

The design of the space clock is based on atomic beam clock with a Ramsey cavity, except a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is placed at each side. Cold atoms are launched from MOTs at both side of the clock simultaneously and move at counter-direction towards each other. The velocity of launched atoms is precisely controlled to the Ramsauer-Townsend resonance so that no additional collision frequency shift is taken place.

Because general-education astronomy may be the only college-level science course taken by these students, it is the last chance to shape the science attitudes of these future journalists, teachers, politicians, and voters. I report on an attempt to measure and induce changes in science attitudes in my general-education astronomy course. I describe construction of the attitude survey, classroom activities designed to influence attitudes, and give numerical results indicating a significant improvement. In contrast, the literature on attitudes in introductory physics courses generally reports stagnation or decline. I briefly comment on some plausible explanations for this difference.

One advantage of homogenization is that material properties, such as permeability and viscosity, readily emerge. A caveat is that the dependence of these parameters upon the microstructure is not self-evident. In particular, one seeks to relate them to the porosity. In this paper, we numerically solve ensembles of the cell problems from which these quantities emerge. Using this data, we estimate relationships between the parameters and the porosity. In particular, the bulk viscosity appears to be inversely proportional to the porosity. Finally, we synthesize these numerical estimates with the models. Our hybrid numerical--analytical model predicts that the compaction length vanishes with porosity.

Our results demonstrate that two electrons of Helium are actually moving around, not as electron clouds.
D1-2583	 Nitrogen, a versatile element, constitutes 78% of Earth's atmosphere, yet in its elemental form, it is relatively inert. However, when combined with other elements, it forms a myriad of crucial compounds. Ammonia (NH3), for instance, is a vital component in fertilizers, while nitric acid (HNO3) is instrumental in the production of explosives and automobile catalysts. Moreover, nitrogenous bases, such as adenine and cytosine, are essential components of DNA, the blueprint of life. Nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, is achieved through a symbiotic relationship between certain bacteria and leguminous plants, or industrially by the Haber-Bosch process. This element's ubiquity and versatility underscore its indispensable role in chemistry and life.
D1-2584	We present analytical solutions for the evolution of collective states of N atoms. On the one hand is a (timed) Dicke state prepared by absorption of a single photon and exhibiting superradiant decay. This is in strong contrast to evolution of a symmetric Dicke state which is trapped for large atomic clouds. We show that virtual processes yield a small effect on the evolution of the rapidly decaying timed Dicke state. However, they change the long time dynamics from exponential decay into a power-law behavior which can be observed experimentally. For trapped states virtual processes are much more important and provide new decay channels resulting in a slow decay of the otherwise trapped state.
D1-2585	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the interplay between atoms is a dance of electrons and protons. This intricate ballet, governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, shapes the properties of substances. Covalent bonds, where atoms share electrons, are prevalent in molecules, knitting them together in intricate structures. Ionic bonds, on the other hand, occur when one atom donates an electron to another, forming ions with opposite charges that attract each other. These bonds underpin the architecture of salts and crystalline solids. The strength of these bonds determines a substance's physical state at room temperature, its hardness, and its reactivity, shaping the vast and diverse tapestry of matter we observe in the world around us.
D1-2586	The scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a spherical particle was solved analytically by Gustav Mie in 1908. The Mie solution is expressed as a series with very many terms thus obscuring the physical interpretations of the results. The purpose of the paper is to try to illustrate this phenomenon within the Ramsauer framework used in atomic and nuclear physics. We show that although the approximations are numerous, the Ramsauer analytical formulae describe fairly well the differential and the total cross sections. This allows us to propose an explanation for the origin of the different structures in the total cross section.
D1-2587	 Nitrogen, an element crucial to life, makes up nearly 80% of Earth's atmosphere. In its diatomic form, N2, it is inert and unreactive, yet when combined with hydrogen under high pressure and temperature, it forms ammonia (NH3), a key compound in fertilizers and plastics. Ammonia is also vital in the Haber-Bosch process, a industrial process that converts nitrogen and hydrogen into ammonium nitrate, a primary ingredient in explosives and fertilizers. Furthermore, nitrogen's ability to form compounds is essential in the synthesis of proteins, the building blocks of life, demonstrating its profound impact on our world.
D1-2588	We describe a fully-automatic 3D-segmentation technique for brain MR images. Using Markov random fields the segmentation algorithm captures three important MR features, i.e. non-parametric distributions of tissue intensities, neighborhood correlations and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. The impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing and structure thickness is analyzed quantitatively. Even single echo MR images are well classified into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone and background. A simulated annealing and an iterated conditional modes implementation are presented.   Keywords: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Segmentation, Markov Random Fields
D1-2589	 Amidst the vibrant spectacle of chemical reactions, one intriguing phenomenon stands out: the synthesis of polymers. Polymers, colossal molecules composed of repeating subunits, are woven into the fabric of our daily lives, from the fibers in our clothing to the plastics in our electronics. Their versatility stems from the myriad ways these subunits, or monomers, can join together, forming complex structures through a process known as polymerization. This process can be initiated by heat, light, or even catalysts, transforming simple molecules into intricate, functional materials that defy the limits of atomic bonds. The world of polymers continues to expand, offering endless possibilities for innovation and groundbreaking discoveries in the realm of chemistry.
D1-2590	To elucidate the influence of shear flow on the generation of magnetic field (the dynamo effect), we study the kinematic limit where the magnetic field does not backreact on the velocity field. By non-perturbatively incorporating the effect of shear in a helically forced turbulence, we show that turbulence intensity and turbulent transport coefficients (turbulent viscosity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effect) are enhanced by a weak shear while strongly suppressed for strong shear. In particular, $\beta$ is shown to be much more strongly suppressed than $\alpha$ effect. We discuss its important implications for dynamo efficiency, i.e. on the scaling of the dynamo number with differential rotation.
D1-2591	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) play pivotal roles. These nucleic acids, composed of nucleotides, serve as the blueprint for cellular functions. DNA, with its double helix structure, stores genetic information, while RNA, in its single-stranded form, acts as a messenger and facilitator for protein synthesis. Both are crucial in replicating life, with their intricate bonding and sequencing patterns determining an organism's traits and characteristics. This symbiotic dance between DNA and RNA underpins the very essence of heredity and evolution, shaping the diversity of life on our planet.
D1-2592	Astronomers in the early 17th century misunderstood the images of stars that they saw in their telescopes. For this reason, the data a skilled observer of that time acquired via telescopic observation of the heavens appeared to support a geocentric Tychonic (or semi-Tychonic) world system, and not a heliocentric Copernican world system. Galileo Galilei made steps in the direction of letting observations lead him towards a Tychonic or semi-Tychonic world system. However, he ultimately backed the Copernican system, against the data he had on hand. By contrast, the German astronomer Simon Marius understood that data acquired by telescopic observation supported a Tychonic world system.
D1-2593	 In the intricate world of chemistry, one compound stands out for its ubiquity and versatility: water (H2O). Beyond quenching thirst and sustaining life, water plays a pivotal role in countless chemical reactions. As a solvent, it dissolves a multitude of substances, facilitating reactions that would otherwise be impossible. As a reactant, it participates in hydrolysis, a process essential to the breakdown of complex molecules. In the realm of acids and bases, water exhibits its unique properties as a Brønsted-Lowry acid and base, donating and accepting hydrogen ions as needed. Indeed, water's chemical behavior is as vital as it is complex, a testament to the wonders of the chemical world.
D1-2594	We propose an approach for studying quantum information and performing high resolution spectroscopy of rotational states of trapped molecular ions using an on-chip superconducting microwave resonator. Molecular ions have several advantages over neutral molecules. Ions can be loaded into deep (1 eV) RF traps and are trapped independent of the electric dipole moment of their rotational transition. Their charge protects them from motional dephasing and prevents collisional loss, allowing 1 s coherence times when used as a quantum memory, with detection of single molecules possible in <10 ms. An analysis of the detection efficiency and coherence properties of the molecules is presented.
D1-2595	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the interaction between atoms forms the very foundation of matter. Ionic bonds, forged by the transfer of electrons, bind atoms of high and low electronegativity, like sodium and chlorine, resulting in stable compounds such as sodium chloride. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, occur when two atoms share electrons, forming a stable arrangement. Water (H2O) is a prime example, with each oxygen atom taking part in four covalent bonds, two with hydrogen and two with other oxygen atoms. These bonds govern the properties and behaviors of substances, dictating reactivity, melting points, boiling points, and more, making chemistry an essential key to understanding the world around us.
D1-2596	We present a concrete picture of spoof surface plasmons (SSPs) combined with cavity resonance to clarify the basic mechanism underlying extraordinary light transmission through metal films with subwavelength slits or holes. This picture may indicate a general mechanism of metallic nanostructure optics: When light is incident on a non-planar conducting surface, the free electrons cannot move homogeneously in response to the incident electric field, i.e., their movement can be impeded at the rough parts, forming inhomogeneous charge distributions. The oscillating charges/dipoles then emit photons (similar to Thomson scattering of x rays by oscillating electrons), and the interference between the photons may give rise to anomalous transmission, reflection or scattering.
D1-2597	 Hydrogen peroxide, a versatile compound with the formula H2O2, is a potent oxidizing agent widely used in various applications. It's a colorless, odorless liquid that decomposes slowly into water and oxygen. This process can be accelerated by catalysts like iron(III) oxide or enzymes like catalase. Hydrogen peroxide is commonly utilized as a bleaching agent in laundry detergents, for sterilization purposes due to its antimicrobial properties, and in the production of other chemicals. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in certain biological processes, such as white blood cell activity during the healing of wounds. Despite its usefulness, it should be handled with care due to its potential to cause damage to skin and eyes.
D1-2598	A spatial light modulator (SLM) and a pair of galvanometer-mounted mirrors (GMM) were combined into an optical tweezers set-up. This provides great flexibility as the SLM creates an array of traps which can be moved smoothly and quickly with the GMM. To optimise performance, the effect of the incidence angle on the SLM with respect to phase and intensity response was investigated. Although it is common to use the SLM at an incidence angle of 45 degrees, smaller angles give a full 2pi phase shift and an output intensity which is less dependent on the magnitude of the phase shift. The traps were calibrated using an active oscillatory technique and a passive probability distribution method.
D1-2599	 In the realm of chemical synthesis, the art of creating complex molecules from simpler ones, a pivotal role is played by catalysts. These intricate substances accelerate reactions, often reducing energy requirements and minimizing unwanted byproducts. For instance, in the industrial production of ammonia, iron-based catalysts facilitate the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen gases, essential for fertilizer production. Similarly, in the automotive industry, platinum catalysts are employed in catalytic converters, converting harmful exhaust gases into less harmful ones, contributing to cleaner air. The study and development of new catalysts continue to be a focal point in chemical research, with potential applications in energy storage, pharmaceuticals, and environmental conservation.
D1-2600	A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array has been developed at FBK-irst having 32 channels and a dimension of 8.0 x 1.1 mm^2. Each 250 um wide channel is subdivided into 5 x 22 rectangularly arranged pixels. These sensors are developed to read out a modular high resolution scintillating fiber tracker. Key properties like breakdown voltage, gain and photon detection efficiency (PDE) are found to be homogeneous over all 32 channels of an SiPM array. This could make scintillating fiber trackers with SiPM array readout a promising alternative to available tracker technologies, if noise properties and the PDE are improved.
D1-2601	 In the intricate world of chemical bonding, the electrons play a pivotal role. They form links between atoms, determining the properties of substances. Ionic bonds, for instance, are formed when electrons are transferred completely from one atom to another, creating ions that then attract each other due to opposite charges. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, occur when electrons are shared between atoms, creating a stable structure. Hydrogen bonds, weaker than the former two, are formed by the partial attraction of electronegative elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen, for hydrogen. These bonds are crucial in understanding compounds like water and DNA, shaping their behavior and properties. The study of chemical bonds is fundamental to our comprehension of the universe's building blocks and the interactions that govern them.
D1-2602	We document our Fortran 77 code for multicanonical simulations of 4D U(1) lattice gauge theory in the neighborhood of its phase transition. This includes programs and routines for canonical simulations using biased Metropolis heatbath updating and overrelaxation, determination of multicanonical weights via a Wang-Landau recursion, and multicanonical simulations with fixed weights supplemented by overrelaxation sweeps. Measurements are performed for the action, Polyakov loops and some of their structure factors. Many features of the code transcend the particular application and are expected to be useful for other lattice gauge theory models as well as for systems in statistical physics.
D1-2603	 In the realm of chemical compounds, water (H2O) stands out as a unique solvent. Its polar structure, characterized by positive hydrogen ions and negative oxygen ions, allows it to dissolve a wide variety of substances - a property known as hydrophilicity. This versatility extends to the realm of life, where water serves as the universal solvent, facilitating reactions within cells and maintaining the body's delicate balance. Beyond biology, water's ability to dissolve many substances makes it an essential component in numerous industrial processes, from manufacturing to energy production. Its ubiquity and versatility underline water's indispensable role in the chemical world and beyond.
D1-2604	Bloch oscillations (i.e., coherent acceleration of matter waves by an optical lattice) and Bragg diffraction are integrated into light-pulse atom interferometers with large momentum splitting between the interferometer arms, and hence enhanced sensitivity. Simultaneous acceleration of both arms in the same internal states suppresses systematic effects, and simultaneously running a pair of interferometers suppresses the effect of vibrations. Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometers using four such Bloch-Bragg-Bloch (BBB) beam splitters exhibit 15% contrast at 24$\hbar k$ splitting, the largest so far ($\hbar k$ is the photon momentum). single beam splitters achieve 88$\hbar k$. The prospects for reaching 100s of $\hbar k$ and applications like gravitational wave sensors are discussed.
D1-2605	 In the realm of chemical bonds, the compelling story of covalent interactions unfolds. These bonds, formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms, are instrumental in molecule formation. For instance, consider the simple H2 molecule. Two hydrogen atoms, each with one electron in their outermost shell, come together. They share these electrons, forming a stable bond that holds the molecule together. This shared electron pair creates a region of high electron density, known as a bonding orbital, which pulls both atoms closer. Conversely, the non-bonding electrons on each hydrogen atom reside in atomic orbitals, creating a repulsion that keeps the molecule from collapsing. Such covalent bonds, fundamental to chemistry, underpin the structure of countless compounds, shaping the very fabric of our world.
D1-2606	We present an elementary method to obtain the equations of the shallow-water solitary waves in different orders of approximation. The first two of these equations are solved to get the shapes and propagation velocities of the corresponding solitary waves. The first-order equation is shown to be equivalent to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, while the second-order equation is solved numerically. The propagation velocity found for the solitary waves of the second-order equation coincides with a known expression, but it is obtained in a simpler way. By measuring the propagation velocity of solitary waves in the laboratory, we demonstrate that the second-order theory gives a considerably improved fit to experimental results.
D1-2607	 In the vibrant world of chemistry, one compound that stands out is water (H2O). It's a simple molecule, yet it plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. Water's unique properties stem from its polar structure, where hydrogen atoms are bonded to an oxygen atom. This polarity gives water its ability to dissolve various substances, making it the universal solvent. Beyond its biological importance, water is also essential in industrial processes, from power generation to manufacturing. Its phase transitions, such as freezing into ice or evaporating into steam, offer valuable insights into the behavior of matter. In essence, water is a testament to the intricate beauty and practical applications of chemistry.
D1-2608	On the basis of the field concept of gravitation and gravitational analogue of the Faradays induction law the difference of inertial mass of a body at its accelerated movement in horizontal and vertical directions relative to the Earth is shown. For an illustration of such a distinction the results of comparison of a motion of balance mechanical watch at horizontal and vertical orientations of balance axis are given. The expediency of statement of precision mechanical experiments with measurement of anisotropy of the inertial mass is noted, allowing to estimate the validity of the field approach in the description of gravitation.

Carbon, with its versatile valence, forms the backbone, while hydrogen and oxygen dance around it, creating intricate patterns. The dance is not just simple, but intricate, as these elements bond to form water, alcohols, acids, and esters. Metals, with their lustrous sheen, add their own allure, forming complex ions that bring about color changes or electrical conductivity. Ionic compounds, salts, and acids and bases, all participate in this grand dance, creating a world where fireworks of reactions light up test tubes and beakers. This constant interplay of elements, each with its distinct character, weaves the tapestry of chemistry, a testament to the beauty of science.
D1-2610	In this pedagogical work we point out a subtle mistake that can be done by undergraduate or graduate students in the computation of the electrostatic energy of a system containing charges and perfect conductors if they naively use the image method. Specifically, we show that the naive expressions for the electrostatic energy for these systems obtained directly from the image method are wrong by a factor 1/2. We start our discussion with well known examples, namely, point charge-perfectly conducting wall and point charge-perfectly conducting sphere and then proceed to the demonstration of general results, valid for conductors of arbitrary shapes.
D1-2611	 Amidst the vibrant world of chemical compounds, one particularly intriguing element captures our attention: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This colorless, odorless liquid is a stable compound of hydrogen and oxygen, existing in a state between water (H2O) and oxygen (O2). Hydrogen peroxide is a versatile substance, with applications ranging from bleaching agents to disinfectants in medical settings. Its unique chemical structure, featuring a broken O-O bond, allows it to generate oxygen when decomposed, making it an essential compound in various industrial and everyday uses. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide's oxidizing properties make it a powerful tool in chemical reactions, contributing to its widespread use in oxidation processes. This humble compound, though simple in structure, demonstrates the wonders of chemistry in everyday life.
D1-2612	We present a method, based on a non-Markovian Langevin equation, to include quantum corrections to the classical dynamics of ions in a quasi-harmonic system. By properly fitting the correlation function of the noise, one can vary the fluctuations in positions and momenta as a function of the vibrational frequency, and fit them so as to reproduce the quantum-mechanical behavior, with minimal a priori knowledge of the details of the system. We discuss the application of the thermostat to diamond and to ice Ih. We find that results in agreement with path-integral molecular dynamics can be obtained using only a fraction of the computational effort.
D1-2613	 In the intricate realm of chemistry, the element carbon, with its versatile valence of four, forms the basis of a myriad of compounds. From diamond's hard, transparent brilliance to graphite's soft, slippery nature, carbon's allotropes showcase its adaptability. Organic chemistry unfolds the complexities of carbon-based life, where carbon bonds with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements, creating an array of intricate structures essential to life. The chemical bond, a fundamental concept, connects atoms, determining the properties and behaviors of substances. Whether it's the intense heat of a flame, the sweetness of a ripe fruit, or the strength of a steel beam, chemistry is the silent orchestrator behind these phenomena.
D1-2614	The issue of the thermodynamics of a system of distinguishable particles is discussed in this paper. In constructing the statistical mechanics of distinguishable particles from the definition of Boltzmann entropy, it is found that the entropy is not extensive. The inextensivity leads to the so-called Gibbs paradox in which the mixing entropy of two identical classical gases increases. Lots of literature from different points of view were created to resolve the paradox. In this paper, starting from the Boltzmann entropy, we present the thermodynamics of the system of distinguishable particles. A straightforward way to get the corrected Boltzmann counting is shown. The corrected Boltzmann counting factor can be justified in classical statistical mechanics.
D1-2615	 Embarking on a vibrant journey through the realm of chemistry, we encounter the fascinating world of polymers. These complex compounds, built from repeating monomer units, exhibit a vast array of properties. From the flexibility of rubber to the strength of Kevlar, polymers permeate our lives, shaping everything from tires to protective clothing. In the realm of biochemistry, proteins, the building blocks of life, are essentially long polymers, each with its unique sequence and function. This intricate dance of molecular interactions is the essence of polymer chemistry, a field that continues to push the boundaries of human ingenuity, offering limitless potential for innovation.
D1-2616	Experiments by several groups during the past decade have shown that a molten polymer nanofilm subject to a large transverse thermal gradient undergoes spontaneous formation of periodic nanopillar arrays. The prevailing explanation is that coherent reflections of acoustic phonons within the film cause a periodic modulation of the radiation pressure which enhances pillar growth. By exploring a deformational instability of particular relevance to nanofilms, we demonstrate that thermocapillary forces play a crucial role in the formation process. Analytic and numerical predictions show good agreement with the pillar spacings obtained in experiment. Simulations of the interface equation further determine the rate of pillar growth of importance to technological applications.
D1-2617	 In the realm of organic chemistry, the intricate dance of carbon atoms weaves a diverse tapestry of compounds. One such compound, cellulose, is the primary component of plant matter, providing the structural basis for the myriad forms of flora. Cellulose molecules, comprised of long chains of glucose units, are intertwined in a rigid, crystalline network, granting plants their strength and rigidity. This biopolymer, when broken down through processes like fermentation, can be harnessed as a renewable energy source, potentially revolutionizing our dependence on fossil fuels. The versatility of cellulose, from its role in photosynthesis to its potential as a sustainable resource, underscores the profound impact of organic chemistry on our world.
D1-2618	J. E. Hirsch (2005) introduced the h-index to quantify an individual's scientific research output by the largest number h of a scientist's papers, that received at least h citations. This so-called Hirsch index can be easily modified to take multiple co-authorship into account by counting the papers fractionally according to (the inverse of) the number of authors. I have worked out 26 empirical cases of physicists to illustrate the effect of this modification. Although the correlation between the original and the modified Hirsch index is relatively strong, the arrangement of the datasets is significantly different depending on whether they are put into order according to the values of either the original or the modified index.
D1-2619	 In the realm of chemical reactions, catalysts serve as a cornerstone, expediting the rate at which a reaction occurs without altering the overall equilibrium. By reducing the activation energy, catalysts enable reactions to take place at lower temperatures and under milder conditions. Their intrinsic property of boosting efficiency makes them indispensable in numerous industrial processes, such as the production of fertilizers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, catalysts are pivotal in environmental protection, facilitating the breakdown of pollutants and waste materials, thereby promoting sustainability. The study and development of novel catalysts continue to be a focal point in chemical research, with potential to revolutionize various sectors and address the challenges of a rapidly evolving world.

The installation consists of a space apparatus, power drive stations, which include a flywheel accumulator (for storage) of energy, a variable reducer, a powerful homopolar electric generator and electric rails. The drive stations accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed.   The estimations and computations show the possibility of making this project a reality in a short period of time (for payloads which can tolerate high g-forces). The launch will be very cheap at a projected cost of 3 - 5 dollars per pound. The authors developed a theory of this type of the launcher.
D1-2621	 In the realm of molecules, chemistry unveils the intriguing dance of atoms. A hydrogen atom, light as a feather, pairs with a heavyweight oxygen, forming water (H2O). This union, as simple as it seems, is the essence of life. Similarly, carbon, with its versatile four electrons, bonds with hydrogen in varying ratios to create hydrocarbons, the building blocks of oil, gas, and plastics. Each bond, a testament to the fundamental forces that govern the universe, holds the potential to transform our world. From the mighty reaction that powers a car's engine to the minute process that allows our bodies to function, chemistry weaves the tapestry of life, binding us all together.
D1-2622	We show that using the properties of the photon Green's function one can successfully describe the propagation of arbitrary nonclassical optical radiation through structured materials. In contrast to the similar input-output approach, our method is not restricted neither to the spatial homogeneous matter nor to the specific direction of light beam incidence or outcoupling. Several quantum states of light are addressed in detail, such as Fock, Glauber, and different squeezed light states, and their Green functions are given. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how scattering of light at a slab can be described with Poynting's energy flow vector, and how experimental setups can be modeled.

Found abundantly in nature, sodium is crucial for maintaining the body's electrolyte balance and is integral to many industrial processes, from manufacturing glass to the production of chemicals. Lithium, another alkali metal, is renowned for its role in powering the modern world, serving as the anode in rechargeable batteries that fuel our smartphones and electric vehicles. The alkali metals' unique properties make them indispensable in our daily lives, their chemistry a testament to the remarkable power that lies within the simplest of elements.

The quantum-state selectivity of the deflection is used to spatially separate molecules according to their quantum state. A detailed analysis of the deflection and the obtained quantum-state selection is presented. The rotational temperatures of the molecular beams are determined from the spatial beam profiles and are all approximately 1 K. Unprecedented degrees of laser-induced alignment $(<\cos^2\theta_{2D}>=0.972)$ and orientation of iodobenzene molecules are demonstrated when the state-selected samples are used. Such state-selected and oriented molecules provide unique possibilities for many novel experiments in chemistry and physics.

Carbon, the building block of life, forges complex bonds with itself and other elements to create an array of organic compounds, the backbone of biomolecules. Silicon and oxygen, intertwining in a rhythm of their own, form the structure of sand, the ubiquitous mineral pillar of Earth's landscapes. In the lab or in nature, chemistry weaves the fabric of our universe, shaping the world around us.
D1-2626	Any future high energy e+e- linear collider aims at precision measurements of Standard Model quantities as well as of new, not yet discovered phenomena. In order to pursue this physics programme, excellent detectors at the interaction region have to be complemented by beam diagnostics of unprecedented precision. This article gives an overview of current plans and issues for polarimeters and energy spectrometers at the International Linear Collider, which have been designed to fulfill the precision goals at a large range of beam energies from 45.6 GeV at the Z pole up to 250 GeV or, as an upgrade, up to 500 GeV.
D1-2627	 In the realm of chemical compounds, water (H2O) stands as a remarkable example of a polar molecule. Its unique structure, characterized by two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom, bears a dipole moment due to the unequal sharing of electrons. This polar nature enables water to form hydrogen bonds, a key factor in its high boiling point compared to other compounds with similar molecular weight. Moreover, water's polarity facilitates its role as a universal solvent, dissolving a wide array of substances, thus fostering numerous chemical reactions in living organisms and various industrial processes.
D1-2628	A hidden symmetry of the nonlinear wave equation is exploited to analyse the propagation of paraxial and uniform atom-laser beams in time-independent, quadratic and cylindrical potentials varying smoothly along the propagation axis. The quality factor and the paraxial ABCD formalism are generalized to account exactly for mean-field interaction effects in such beams. Using an approach based on moments, these theoretical tools provide a very simple and yet exact picture of the interacting beam profile evolution. Guided atom laser experiments are discussed. This treatment addresses simultaneously optical and atomic beams in a unified manner, exploiting the formal analogy between nonlinear optics and nonlinear paraxial atom optics.

These unassuming substances accelerate reactions without being consumed, enabling processes that would otherwise be sluggish or impossible. Gold and platinum catalysts, for instance, speed up the production of polyethylene, the plastic wrapping our groceries. Meanwhile, zeolites, a class of crystalline minerals, act as catalysts in the refining of gasoline, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient fuel. These catalysts, though often overlooked, play a pivotal role in shaping our modern world, making possible the conveniences we take for granted.
D1-2630	The Gaussian formula and spherical aberrations of the static and relativistic curved mirrors are analyzed using the optical path length (OPL) and Fermat's principle. The geometrical figures generated by the rotation of conic sections about their symmetry axes are considered for the shapes of the mirrors. By comparing the results in static and relativistic cases, it is shown that the focal lengths and the spherical aberration relations of the relativistic mirrors obey the Lorentz contraction. Further analysis of the spherical aberrations for both static and relativistic cases have resulted in the information about the limits for the paraxial approximation, as well as for the minimum speed of the systems to reduce the spherical aberrations.
D1-2631	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the intriguing phenomenon of covalent bonds emerges. Unlike ionic bonds, where electrons are transferred from one atom to another, covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share electrons, creating a stable electron configuration. This sharing can occur in various ways, such as single, double, or triple bonds depending on the number of electron pairs shared between atoms. The strength of these bonds is influenced by factors like the electronegativity of the atoms involved and the number of bonds formed between them. These covalent unions play a pivotal role in shaping the properties and structures of various molecules, from the DNA's intricate twists to the complex carbon compounds that form the backbone of life.
D1-2632	In this paper we present a mathematical analysis for a steady-state laminar boundary layer flow, governed by the Ostwald-de Wael power-law model of an incompressible non- Newtonian fluid past a semi-infinite power-law stretched flat plate with uniform free stream velocity. A generalization of the usual Blasius similarity transformation is used to find similarity solutions [1]. Under appropriate assumptions, partial differential equations are transformed into an autonomous third-order nonlinear degenerate ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions. Using a shooting method, we establish the existence of an infinite number of global unbounded solutions. The asymptotic behavior is also discussed. Some properties of those solutions depend on the viscosity power-law index.
D1-2633	 In the realm of chemical reactions, the concept of equilibrium is pivotal. At this delicate balance, reactants and products coexist, neither entirely consumed nor produced. The rate of forward reaction equals the rate of reverse reaction, a dynamic dance of molecular transformation. This equilibrium is influenced by factors such as temperature and concentration, with changes in these conditions tilting the balance towards more products or reactants. This dance of chemical equilibrium, while seemingly constant, is in fact a dynamic interplay, a testament to the ongoing dance of nature.
D1-2634	"We simulate the impact of a viscous liquid drop onto a smooth dry solid surface. As in experiments, when ambient air effects are negligible, impact flattens the falling drop without producing a splash. The no-slip boundary condition at the wall produces a boundary layer inside the liquid. Later, the flattening surface of the drop traces out the boundary layer. As a result, the eventual shape of the drop is a ""pancake"" of uniform thickness except at the rim, where surface tension effects are significant. The thickness of the pancake is simply the height where the drop surface first collides with the boundary layer."
D1-2635	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA's dual helical structure, a testament to the intricate dance of hydrogen bonds, plays a pivotal role in encoding the blueprint of life. This double helix, a product of Adenine-Thymine and Guanine-Cytosine pairings, embodies the essence of complementarity, ensuring the fidelity of genetic information transmission from one generation to the next. The process of replication, initiated by enzymes like DNA polymerase, unwinds this helix, creating a temporary single strand. Complementary nucleotides, guided by hydrogen bonds, then link together, reforming the double helix, thus completing the cycle of life's replication. This enduring dance of bonds, a testament to the power of chemistry, has been the cornerstone of biological evolution, shaping the diversity of life on Earth.
D1-2636	Wavelength scaling law for the yield of high-order harmonic emission is theoretically examined for excited state atoms which are optically prepared by simultaneously exposing to an extreme ultraviolet pulse at the resonant wavelength and an infrared pulse at a variable wavelength in the range of 0.8\mum-2.4\mum.

This double-helix macromolecule carries genetic instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Each strand of the DNA helix is composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone, connected by phosphate-deoxyribose bonds, and nitrogenous bases, adenine (A) pairing with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) with guanine (G). The sequence of these bases forms the genetic code, encoding instructions for synthesizing proteins, regulating gene expression, and maintaining cellular functions. DNA's intricate structure and coding mechanism underpin the incredible complexity and diversity of life on Earth.
D1-2696	Following Nye and Berry's analogy with crystal dislocations, an approach to the Burgers vector of a wave dislocation (phase singularity, optical vortex) is proposed. It is defined to be a regularized phase gradient evaluated at the phase singularity, and is computed explicitly. The screw component of this vector is naturally related to the helicoidal twisting of wavefronts along a vortex line, and is related to the helicity of the phase gradient. The edge component is related to the nearby current flow (defined by the phase gradient) perpendicular to the vortex, and the distribution of this component is found numerically for random two-dimensional monochromatic waves.
D1-2697	 In the vast realm of chemistry, one fascinating compound captures our attention: water (H2O). This ubiquitous substance, essential for life, is a colorless, odorless liquid at room temperature. Water's unique properties, such as its high boiling point and surface tension, are due to the hydrogen bonds between its hydrogen and oxygen atoms. These bonds make water a versatile solvent, capable of dissolving a wide range of substances. Moreover, water plays a crucial role in biochemical reactions, acting as a medium for reactions in living organisms. Its role in chemical processes and life itself underscores water's indispensable place in the world of chemistry.
D1-2698	We address the elliptically shaped vortex solitons in defocusing nonlinear media imprinted with a composite Mathieu lattice. Elliptic vortices feature anisotropic patterns both in intensity and phase, and can only exist when their energy flow exceed some certain threshold. Single-charged elliptic vortices are found to arise via bifurcation from dipole modes, which, to the best of our knowledge is the first example in the context of optics studies of symmetry breaking bifurcations for the phase dislocations of different dimensionalities. Higher-order elliptic vortices with topological charge could exhibit spatially separated single-charged phase singularities, leading to their stabilization. The salient features of reported elliptic vortices qualitatively hold for other elliptic shaped confining potentials.
D1-2699	 In the intricate dance of molecular interactions, hydrogen bonds assume a pivotal role. Beyond their ubiquity in water, these weak yet influential bonds are prevalent in many organic compounds, shaping their properties. Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom, bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, is attracted to a lone pair on another electronegative atom. This intermolecular force, weaker than covalent bonds but stronger than van der Waals, influences the melting and boiling points, solubility, and crystal structures of various substances. The presence or absence of hydrogen bonds can significantly impact a compound's behavior and reactivity, demonstrating their vital role in chemistry.
D1-2700	According to general relativity, a spinning body of mass M and angular momentum S, like a star or a planet, generates a gravitomagnetic field which induces, among other phenomena, also the Lense-Thirring effect, i.e. secular precessions of the path of a test particle orbiting it. Direct and indisputable tests of such a relativistic prediction are still missing. We discuss some performed attempts to measure it in the gravitational fields of several bodies in the Solar System with natural and artificial objects. The focus is on the realistic evaluation of the impact of some competing classical forces regarded as sources of systematic uncertainties degrading the total accuracy obtainable.

Carbon, versatile and strong, builds complex structures, from the graphite in our pencils to the DNA in our cells. Iron, essential for life, binds with sulfur to create iron sulfide, a mineral found in meteorites, connecting us to the cosmos. These harmonious unions and transformations, visible in a simple test tube or the vast expanse of the universe, reveal the unending symphony of chemistry.
D1-2702	The cosmological principle says that the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. It predicts, among other phenomena, the cosmic redshift of light and the Hubble law. Nevertheless, the existence of structure in the Universe violates the (exact) cosmological principle. A more precise formulation of the cosmological principle must allow for the formation of structure and must therefore incorporate probability distributions. In this contribution to the Memorial Volume for Wolfgang Kummer, a great teacher and mentor to me, I discuss how we could formulate a new version of the cosmological principle, how to test it, and how to possibly justify it by fundamental physics. My contribution starts with some of my memories of Wolfgang.
D1-2703	 In the realm of chemistry, hydrogen bonding plays a pivotal role, especially in water and organic molecules. This intermolecular force, weaker than ionic or covalent bonds, arises due to the attractive electrostatic interaction between a partially positive hydrogen atom of one molecule and a partially negative atom of another. It's responsible for the liquid state of water at room temperature, as hydrogen bonds hold the water molecules together, and for the unique properties of substances like DNA, where hydrogen bonds stabilize the double helix structure. This bond, though weak, significantly influences the physical and chemical behavior of numerous compounds, making it an essential concept in the study of chemistry.
D1-2704	pCVD diamond sensors are regularly used as beam loss monitors in accelerators by measuring the ionization of the lost particles. In the past these beam loss monitors showed sudden increases in the dark leakage current without beam losses and these erratic leakage currents were found to decrease, if magnetic fields were present. Here we report on a systematic study of leakage currents inside a magnetic field. The decrease of erratic currents in a magnetic field was confirmed. On the contrary, diamonds without erratic currents showed an increase of the leakage current in a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field for fields up to 0.6T, for higher fields it decreases. A preliminary model is introduced to explain the observations.
D1-2705	 Amidst the myriad of chemical reactions that govern our world, one stands out for its ubiquity and importance: photosynthesis. This process, carried out by plants and certain microorganisms, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It's a dance of electrons, a symphony of atoms, an intricate ballet of chemical transformations. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, acts as a catalyst, absorbing light and setting off a cascade of events. Carbon dioxide and water split, carbon being fixed into glucose, while oxygen is released into the atmosphere. This life-sustaining process, essential for our planet's survival, underscores the intricate and delicate balance of chemistry that governs our world.

Here we report the absolute frequencies of the P$_{3/2}$ states for principal quantum numbers $n=36$ to $n=63$. These measurements were made with a three step laser excitation scheme. A wavemeter was calibrated against a frequency comb to provide accurate absolute frequency measurements over the entire range, reducing the measurement uncertainty to 1MHz. We compare the spectroscopic results with known frequency measurements as a test of measurement accuracy.

This colorless gas, composed of a central silicon atom bonded to four fluorine atoms, is a crucial component in various industries. It's extensively used in the production of silicones, semiconductors, and fluorinated polymers. The bond between silicon and fluorine is exceptionally strong, a testament to the powerful draw of electronegative elements. The reactivity of SiF4 is remarkable, making it a versatile tool in chemical synthesis. Despite its potency, it's also a challenge in waste management due to its toxicity and environmental impact. Thus, the handling and disposal of SiF4 require meticulous care, underscoring its dual role in both progress and caution.
D1-2708	Eighty years after de Broglie's, and a little more than half a century after Bohm's seminal papers, the de Broglie--Bohm theory (a.k.a. Bohmian mechanics), which is presumably the simplest theory which explains the orthodox quantum mechanics formalism, has reached an exemplary state of conceptual clarity and mathematical integrity. No other theory of quantum mechanics comes even close. Yet anyone curious enough to walk this road to quantum mechanics is soon being confused by many misleading signposts that have been put up, and not just by its detractors, but unfortunately enough also by some of its proponents.   This paper outlines a road map to help navigate ones way.

Derived from willow bark, this wonder drug revolutionized medicine. Its unique structure, featuring an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid and an ester group, enables it to inhibit cyclooxygenase, reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. Aspirin's therapeutic effects also extend to preventing blood clots, making it indispensable in cardiovascular care. Despite its widespread use, exploring its potential further, particularly in cancer research, continues to captivate chemists and medical professionals alike.
D1-2710	When an infectious disease strikes a population, the number of newly reported cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early stages of the outbreak. An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, from the limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.
D1-2711	 In the intricate realm of organic chemistry, carbon stands as the linchpin, forming intricate chains and rings to create an array of complex molecules. The versatility of carbon lies in its ability to bond with four other atoms, providing a foundation for an immense variety of structures. Each carbon-carbon bond can rotate freely, allowing for countless configurations, a phenomenon known as isomerism. This dynamic flexibility enables carbon to construct the building blocks of life, from the sugars and amino acids essential for biological processes to the polymers that underpin materials science. The bonding patterns, reactions, and transformations in organic chemistry offer a fascinating tapestry of relationships and interactions, unveiling the secrets of the molecules that define our world.

In particular, when the inner or outer radius is varied, guided modes with similar and dissimilar dispersive features are obtained and discussed. A brief comparison of the propagating modes for the present subwavelength plasmonic coaxial lines and those for a subwavelength plasmonic hole and wire is also made.
D1-2713	 In the realm of chemical reactions, energy transfers play a pivotal role. These processes, driven by the quest for equilibrium, can be exothermic or endothermic. Exothermic reactions release energy, often heating the surrounding environment, such as the combustion of methane, a primary component in natural gas, producing carbon dioxide and water. Conversely, endothermic reactions absorb energy, typically cooling their surroundings, like the process of dissolving salt in water, where the dissolving salt molecules take up energy from the environment, a phenomenon known as enthalpy of solution. These reactions, though seemingly disparate, are fundamentally connected, shaping the world around us through energy transformations.
D1-2714	The properties of bosonic Ytterbium photoassociation spectra near the intercombination transition $^{1}S_{0}$--$^{3}P_{1}$ are studied theoretically at ultra low temperatures. We demonstrate how the shapes and intensities of rotational components of optical Feshbach resonances are affected by mass tuning of the scattering properties of the two colliding ground state atoms. Particular attention is given to the relationship between the magnitude of the scattering length and the occurrence of shape resonances in higher partial waves of the van der Waals system. We develop a mass scaled model of the excited state potential that represents the experimental data for different isotopes. The shape of the rotational photoassociation spectrum for various bosonic Yb isotopes can be qualitatively different.
D1-2715	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity scale provides a valuable tool for understanding the nature of the interactions between atoms. Developed by Linus Pauling, this scale ranks elements based on their tendency to attract electrons, with higher values indicating greater pull. For instance, fluorine, with an electronegativity value of 3.98, is the most electronegative element, while cesium, with a value of 0.79, is the least. These differences in electronegativity dictate the formation of ionic or covalent bonds, shaping the very structure of molecules and compounds, and playing a crucial role in the properties and reactivity of materials in our world.
D1-2716	In this article, we analytically study second harmonic (SH) generation from thin metallic films with subwavelength, non-centrosymmetry patterns. Because the thickness of the film is much smaller than the SH wavelength, retardation effects are negligible. The far-field SH intensities are thus dominated by an effective electric dipole. These analytical observations are further justified numerically by studying the effect of polarization of the fundamental field on both the SH signal and the electric dipole. It is demonstrated that bulk SH polarization density is comparable with its surface counterpart. The electric dipole, consequently, originates from the entire {volume of the metallic membrane, in contrast to the fact that SH generation from metal surface is generally dominated by a surface dipole.
D1-2717	 Nitrous oxide, a colorless, odorless gas, is chemically known as N2O. It's a versatile compound, widely used in various industries and medical applications. In the food industry, it's employed as a whipping agent, giving a creamy texture to whipped cream and other products. In the medical field, it serves as an anesthetic and as a treatment for angina. In its polluted form, it contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer. On a more positive note, it's also used in rocket propulsion and as a laughing gas due to its euphoric effect on the human brain. Despite its numerous uses, its impact on the environment and human health necessitates careful handling and monitoring.
D1-2718	Transformation optics is used to design a gateway that can block electromagnetic waves but allows the passage of other entities. Our conceptual device has the advantage that it can be realized with simple materials and structural parameters and can have a reasonably wide bandwidth. In particular, we show that our system can be implemented by using a magnetic photonic crystal structure that employs a square ray of ferrite rods, and as the field response of ferrites can be tuned by external magnetic fields, we end up with an electromagnetic gateway that can be open or shut using external fields. The functionality is also robust against the positional disorder of the rods that made up the photonic crystal.
D1-2719	 Nitrogen, an element vital to life, constitutes nearly 78% of Earth's atmosphere. In its triatomic form, nitrogen gas (N2) is inert and unresponsive, making it unable to support combustion or most chemical reactions. However, under specific conditions, nitrogen can be transformed into compounds essential for fertilizers, explosives, and even biological molecules. For instance, ammonia (NH3), a key component of fertilizers, is produced industrially from nitrogen and hydrogen through the Haber-Bosch process. Similarly, nitrates and nitrites, used in explosives and food preservation, are formed through microbial processes or chemical reactions. Furthermore, nitrogen is integral to the structure of proteins, nucleotides, and other biomolecules, underscoring its indispensable role in the intricate web of life.
D1-2720	We investigate an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game among self-driven agents, where collective motion of biological flocks is imitated through averaging directions of neighbors. Depending on the temptation to defect and the velocity at which agents move, we find that cooperation can not only be maintained in such a system but there exists an optimal size of interaction neighborhood, which can induce the maximum cooperation level. When compared with the case that all agents do not move, cooperation can even be enhanced by the mobility of individuals, provided that the velocity and the size of neighborhood are not too large. Besides, we find that the system exhibits aggregation behavior, and cooperators may coexist with defectors at equilibrium.

The synthesis of these molecules, guided by the principles of reaction kinetics, offers chemists the power to create new materials, advance medicine, and unravel the mysteries of the universe itself. This dance of carbon, a testament to nature's ingenuity, continues to captivate and challenge chemists worldwide.

Our analysis is supported by novel experimental results concerning pollutant concentration profiles inside a vertical column setup. We describe the experimental methods and elucidate the salient outcomes of the measurements, with focus on miscible fluids in homogeneous saturated media. By resorting to a finite elements approach, we numerically solve the equations that rule the pollutants migration and compare the simulation results with the experimental data. Finally, we qualitatively explore the interfacial dynamics behavior between the dense contaminant plume and the lighter resident fluid that saturates the column.
D1-2723	 In the realm of chemical bonding, the electronegativity difference between atoms dictates the nature of a bond. For instance, the stronger ionic bond between sodium and chlorine arises from the significant difference in electronegativity, causing chlorine to attract electrons predominantly, forming Na+ and Cl-. Conversely, the covalent bond between two carbon atoms, both exhibiting similar electronegativity values, results in a more even sharing of electrons. This fundamental principle governs the formation of compounds, influencing properties such as melting points, boiling points, and reactivity. Understanding electronegativity thus provides a key to deciphering the intricate dance of atoms in chemical reactions.
D1-2724	We present an efficient approach to evaluate two-center two-electron integrals with exponential functions and with an arbitrary polynomial in electron-nucleus and electron-electron distances. We show that the master integral with the single negative power of all distances can be obtained from the second order differential equation in $r$, the distance between nuclei. For particular values of nonlinear parameters corresponding to the James-Coolidge basis, we find a fully analytic expression. For integrals with arbitrary powers of all distances, we construct recursion relations which starts from the master integral. The presented approach opens a window for the high precision calculations of relativistic effects in diatomic molecules.
D1-2725	 Amidst the vibrant world of chemistry, a fascinating entity captivates our attention: the molecule.

From the simple water molecule, H2O, to the complex protein chains, they govern everything from the fluidity of liquids to the solidity of solids. The molecule's structure determines its behavior, be it the explosive nature of nitroglycerin or the cooling effect of menthol. As we delve deeper into the molecular realm, we unlock the secrets of matter, shedding light on the fundamental building blocks that make up our universe. The study of molecules, therefore, is not just a pursuit of academic interest. it's a key to understanding the very essence of life.
D1-2726	Solar UV emission has a profound impact on the upper terrestrial atmosphere. Because of instrumental constraints, however, solar proxies often need to be used as substitutes for the solar spectral variability. Finding proxies that properly reproduce specific spectral bands or lines is an ongoing problem. Using daily observations from 2003 to 2008 and a multiscale statistical approach, we test the performances of 9 proxies for the UV solar flux. Their relevance is evaluated at different time-scales and a novel representation allows all quantities to be compared simultaneously. This representation reveals which proxies are most appropriate for different spectral bands and for different time scales.
D1-2727	 In the realm of chemical bonds, the covalent bond stands as a fundamental unit, connecting atoms in a myriad of organic and inorganic compounds. These bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, creating a stable electron configuration. For instance, in the hydrogen molecule (H2), each hydrogen atom contributes one electron, forming a mutual linkage. Conversely, in water (H2O), two hydrogen atoms share electrons with the oxygen atom, forming two covalent bonds and a lone pair. This simple yet profound phenomenon serves as the backbone for the vast diversity of matter we observe in the world.

In essence, catalysts are the unsung heroes of modern chemistry, propelling the world forward, one reaction at a time.
D1-2732	We present and discuss a variance-reduced stochastic particle method for simulating the relaxation-time model of the Boltzmann transport equation. The present paper focuses on the dilute gas case, although the method is expected to directly extend to all fields (carriers) for which the relaxation-time approximation is reasonable. The variance reduction, achieved by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium, results in a significant computational efficiency advantage compared to traditional stochastic particle methods in the limit of small deviation from equilibrium. More specifically, the proposed method can efficiently simulate arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium at a computational cost that is independent of the deviation from equilibrium, which is in sharp contrast to traditional particle methods.
D1-2733	 In the realm of molecular chemistry, the concept of resonance structures offers a fascinating glimpse into the unseen world of electrons. Resonance is a phenomenon where a molecule can't be accurately described by a single electron distribution, instead, it exists as a mixture of several structures, each representing a possible distribution of electrons. This concept, first introduced by Linus Pauling, allows us to understand the stability and reactivity of certain molecules, such as benzene, more accurately. It's a testament to the intricate dance of electrons, a ballet of charges that defies our initial perceptions of a molecule's structure. This understanding, in turn, opens doors to the exploration of chemical reactions, electronic properties, and even the design of new materials.

The cavity geometry, consisting of a pair of silica disks separated by a nanoscale gap, shows extremely strong dynamical backaction, powerful enough to excite giant coherent oscillations even under heavily damped conditions (mechanical Q=4). In vacuum, the threshold for regenerative mechanical oscillation is lowered to an optical input power of only 270-nanoWatts, or roughly 1000 stored cavity photons, and efficient cooling of the mechanical motion is obtained with a temperature compression factor of 13-dB for 4-microWatts of dropped optical input power.

The transient responses of the devices are studied numerically with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method and the results are verified with analytical formulas. We compute the effective bandwidth of several cloaking schemes as well as the effect of losses on the performance of the structures. We also find that narrowband behavior, frequency shift effects, time delays and spatial disturbances of the incoming waves are dominant due to the inherently dispersive nature of the devices. These effects are important and should be taken into account when designing metamaterial-based devices.

This is demonstrated by full recovery of the detection efficiency two gate cycles after a detection event, as well as a measured maximum detection rate of 497 MHz. As an application, we measure the second order correlation function $g^{(2)}$ of the emission from a diode laser with a single detector which works reliably at high speed owing to the extremely short dead time of the detector. The device is ideal for high bit rate fiber wavelength quantum key distribution and photonic quantum computing.

The model is based on the double-distribution-function LB method, which has attracted much attention since its emergence for its excellent numerical stability. Compared with the existing axisymmetric thermal LB models, the present model is simpler and retains the inherent features of the standard LB method. Numerical simulations are carried out for the thermally developing laminar flows in circular ducts and the natural convection in an annulus between two coaxial vertical cylinders. The Nusselt number obtained from the simulations agrees well with the analytical solutions and/or the results reported in previous studies.

This versatile element plays a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly as a key component of proteins, DNA, and amino acids. In industry, nitrogen is integral to the production of fertilizers, plastics, and explosives. The process of fixing atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, known as nitrogen fixation, is a vital industrial process. It involves converting nitrogen gas into ammonia through a series of chemical reactions, primarily through the Haber-Bosch process. This process has revolutionized agriculture, enabling the growth of crops on a larger scale and contributing significantly to global food production. Despite its widespread use, concerns about the environmental impact of nitrogen fixation persist, prompting ongoing research to develop more sustainable methods.
D1-2744	We address the problem of how the survival of cooperation in a social system depends on the motion of the individuals. Specifically, we study a model in which Prisoner's Dilemma players are allowed to move in a two-dimensional plane.

D1-2798	Electron-positron pair production is considered in the relativistic collision of a nucleus and an anti-nucleus, in which both leptons are created in bound states of the corresponding nucleus-lepton system. Compared to free and bound-free pair production this process is shown to display a qualitatively different dependency both on the impact energy and charged of the colliding particles. Interestingly, at high impact energies the cross section for this process is found to be larger than that for the analogous atomic process of non-radiative electron capture although the latter does not involve the creation of new particles.

For that purpose, we have overlayed a direct-optimization scheme on top of a fully unconstrained computation of the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The procedure looks for pulses that maintain the same total length and integrated intensity or fluence as a given pulse that serves as an initial guess. It allows, however, for changes in frequencies -- within a certain, predefined range -- and overall shape, leading to enhanced ionization. We illustrate the scheme by calculating ionization yields for the H2+ molecule when irradiated with short (~5 fs), high-intensity laser pulses.

A flexible and accurate finite-element discrete-variable-representation is applied to discretize the problem on the radial grid in spherical coordinates. Good agreement with the most recent experimental data for absolute angle-integrated cross sections is obtained over a wide range of incident projectile energies between 3 keV and 6 MeV. Furthermore, angle-differential cross sections for two-electron ejection are predicted for a proton impact energy of 6 MeV. Finally, the time evaluation of the ionization process is portrayed by displaying the electron density as a function of the projectile location.

We consider some common stationary distributions and show that they would be unstable against rigid dipole oscillations. We then discuss an analytical model for the line density that best describes measured bunch profiles. We include space charge in this model to predict the bunch intensity at which Landau damping would be lost. The dependence of this threshold on the bunch length is studied and related to the results of an experimental study with shorter bunch lengths. The threshold for the microwave instability is estimated. These studies will be followed by more detailed numerical studies.

The wave function at origin plays a key role in the calculation of the pionium lifetime, various finite nuclear size effects and the hyperfine splitting. The results are obtained for the $1s$ and $2s$ states in pionic and muonic hydrogen and deuterium and in pionium, a bound system of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$. Applications to the hyperfine structure and the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen are also considered.

Polymers, often referred to as 'plastics', are large molecules composed of repeating structural units, known as monomers. Through a process called polymerization, these monomers link together to form long chains. The properties of polymers can be tailored by manipulating their structure, such as the type of monomer, the arrangement of the links, or the presence of additives. This versatility makes polymers indispensable in various industries, from packaging materials to medical devices, demonstrating their profound impact on our daily lives.
D1-2812	We re-examine past suggestions of a close link between terrestrial climate change and the Sun's transit of spiral arms in its path through the Milky Way galaxy. These links produced concrete fits, deriving the unknown spiral pattern speed from terrestrial climate correlations. We test these fits against new data on spiral structure based on CO data that does not make simplifying assumptions about symmetry and circular rotation. If we compare the times of these transits to changes in the climate of Earth, not only do the claimed correlations disappear, but also we find that they cannot be resurrected for any reasonable pattern speed.
D1-2813	 In the realm of molecular dynamics, the concept of polarity plays a pivotal role. Polarity, in essence, is the uneven distribution of electrons within a molecule, leading to a partial positive and negative charge. This distinction dictates a molecule's behavior towards other substances, influencing solubility, reactivity, and even the formation of bonds. For instance, water, H2O, is polar due to its unequal sharing of electrons between hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This polarity allows water to form hydrogen bonds, a key factor in its unique properties like high boiling point and solvent capabilities. Similarly, polar molecules tend to mix with other polar substances, while nonpolar molecules prefer nonpolar environments, a fundamental principle in chemistry that underpins myriad phenomena.
D1-2814	Single vehicle data obtained from magnetic loops on an expressway allowed us to measure velocity correlations and velocity differences between non--neighbor vehicles on the same lane, showing some strong correlations even for platoons of 7 or 8 vehicles. The corresponding time headway distribution for non--neighbor vehicles is also presented. We were also able to get some informations about inter--lane structures, through crossed time headway distributions. It should be noticed that these last results on crossed time headways are meaningful only because the subset of data we used corresponds to a unique stationary traffic state -- and still contains a large amount of data, with a large fraction of short time headways. The link with passing maneuvers is discussed.

For instance, the slowing down of light in a transparent medium is always explained within the electromagnetic wave framework. We propose to approach that phenomenon through a purely corpuscular description. We find expression for the refractive indices which differ slightly from the usual Maxwell wave approach. We thus compare these expressions against experimental refractive indices and we show that both reproduce well the data. We show also how this corpuscular framework gives a very natural interpretation to the self focusing Kerr effect. Finally an experimental expectation of fluctuation of the speed of light is presented.
D1-2817	 In the intricate dance of elements, hydrogen and oxygen unite to form water, a fundamental substance essential for life on Earth.

A double helix structure composed of nucleotides, it carries all genetic information, encoded in a sequence of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine bases. The arrangement of these bases determines an organism's traits, from eye color to hair texture. Genetic engineering, a modern application of this knowledge, manipulates these sequences to introduce desirable traits or correct genetic defects, shaping the course of evolution in a more deliberate manner. This technology, while promising, raises ethical questions about the boundaries of human intervention in natural processes.
D1-2820	A crab cavity is required in the CLIC to allow effective head-on collision of bunches at the IP. A high operating frequency is preferred as the deflection voltage required for a given rotation angle and the RF phase tolerance for a crab cavity are inversely proportional to the operating frequency. The short bunch spacing of the CLIC scheme and the high sensitivity of the crab cavity to dipole kicks demand very high damping of the inter-bunch wakes, the major contributor to the luminosity loss of colliding bunches. This paper investigates the nature of the wakefields in the CLIC crab cavity and the possibility of using various damping schemes to suppress them effectively.

Nitric acid plays a significant role in various applications, including fertilizer production, explosives synthesis, and as a key component in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters. Moreover, it serves as a crucial reagent in numerous laboratory experiments due to its ability to oxidize and nitrate other substances. Its versatility and indispensable role in chemistry make nitric acid an essential compound in both industrial and academic settings.
D1-2822	We address the stability of light bullets supported by Bessel optical lattices with out-of-phase modulation of the linear and nonlinear refractive indices. We show that spatial modulation of the nonlinearity significantly modifies the shapes and stability domains of the light bullets. The addressed bullets can be stable, provided that the peak intensity does not exceed a critical value. We show that the width of the stability domain in terms of the propagation constant may be controlled by varying the nonlinearity modulation depth. In particular, we show that the maximum energy of the stable bullets grows with increasing nonlinearity modulation depth.
D1-2823	 In the vibrant world of chemical synthesis, the reaction of sodium and chlorine yields a familiar product: sodium chloride, or table salt. This process, known as an ionic bond formation, occurs when the electronegative chlorine atom attracts electrons from the sodium atom, forming positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). The resulting ions then arrange themselves in a crystal lattice, creating the familiar white crystal structure that seasons our meals. This reaction demonstrates the fundamental principles of electrochemistry, highlighting the interplay between atoms, electrons, and energy in chemical reactions.
D1-2824	We present numerical simulations of the magnetic field generated by the flow of liquid sodium driven by two counter-rotating impellers (VKS experiment). Using a dynamo kinematic code in cylindrical geometry, it is shown that different magnetic modes can be generated depending on the flow configuration. While the time averaged axisymmetric mean flow generates an equatorial dipole, our simulations show that an axial field of either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetry can be generated by taking into account non-axisymmetric components of the flow. Moreover, we show that by breaking a symmetry of the flow, the magnetic field becomes oscillatory. This leads to reversals of the axial dipole polarity, involving a competition with the quadrupolar component.
D1-2825	 Nitrogen, a versatile element, constitutes approximately 78% of Earth's atmosphere. It exists in three forms in nature: diatomic nitrogen (N2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Diatomic nitrogen, the most abundant, is biologically inert and unavailable for most biological processes. However, nitrogen fixation, primarily performed by bacteria like Rhizobium, converts this inert gas into ammonia (NH3). This ammonia is crucial for plant growth, serving as a building block for proteins, nucleic acids, and other essential compounds. Nitric oxide and nitrous oxide, while minor components of the atmosphere, play significant roles as signaling molecules in living organisms and as greenhouse gases, respectively. Understanding nitrogen's various forms and their interactions is vital for advancing agriculture, environmental conservation, and human health.
D1-2826	We discuss the influence of a single or double fullerenes shell upon photoionization and vacancy decay of an atom, stuffed inside the fullerenes construction. The main manifestations of this influence are additional structures in the photoionization cross-section and variation of the vacancy decay probability. The main mechanisms, with which fullerenes shells affect the processes in caged atoms is the scattering of the outgoing electrons by the fullerenes shell and modification of the photon beam due to fullerenes shell polarization. General consideration will be illustrated by numeric calculations where C60 and C240 will be chosen as fullerenes and Ar and Xe as caged atoms.
D1-2827	 Amidst the vibrant world of chemical synthesis, one compound stands out for its versatility and ubiquity: carbon dioxide (CO2). This colorless, odorless gas is a crucial component of our atmosphere, playing a pivotal role in the Earth's carbon cycle. In the natural world, plants absorb CO2 during photosynthesis, converting it into oxygen and glucose, a process essential for life on our planet. Conversely, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation release CO2 into the air, contributing to global warming and climate change. Understanding and managing carbon dioxide emissions is a critical challenge for scientists and policymakers alike, as they strive to balance the needs of industry with the health of our environment.

Operational conditions were studied as a function of the electric field. Energy resolutions of <10 % (FWHM) were achieved by combining the scintillation light and ionization charge signals. The relationship between scintillation light and ionization signals was investigated. An analysis of the sources of fluctuations was performed in order to optimize future detector designs.

Synthetic polymers, crafted in laboratories, offer versatility and durability, while biopolymers, found in nature, have sparked advancements in biomedicine and sustainable materials. The exploration of polymers continues to unravel their potential, paving the way for innovations in technology, medicine, and beyond.
D1-2830	Five new correlations between sunspot activity and orbiting position of the Jovian planets are detected. In order to explain these correlations it is suggested that the resonance of the outer planets destabilizes the orbit of Kuiper Belt Objects and generates a cyclical impact frequency on the Sun. The vaporization of the object initiates a shock way disrupting the upwelling of the plasma resulting in a sunspot formation. The proposed model is able to explain the length of the cycle, the latitude distribution of the sunspots and the extremely long term stability of the cycles. Calculating the positions of the Jovian planets at conjunction and opposition allows the long term prediction of the solar activity.

When combined with other light elements, such as helium, hydrogen releases vast amounts of energy through nuclear reactions, powering stars and driving the cosmic dance of celestial bodies. This clean, renewable energy source holds immense potential for Earth, particularly in mitigating our carbon emissions and transitioning towards a sustainable future. Hydrogen, thus, bridges the gap between the cosmos and our planet, offering a testament to the interconnectedness of all things.
D1-2832	We model the mobility of mobile phone users to study the fundamental spreading patterns characterizing a mobile virus outbreak. We find that while Bluetooth viruses can reach all susceptible handsets with time, they spread slowly due to human mobility, offering ample opportunities to deploy antiviral software. In contrast, viruses utilizing multimedia messaging services could infect all users in hours, but currently a phase transition on the underlying call graph limits them to only a small fraction of the susceptible users. These results explain the lack of a major mobile virus breakout so far and predict that once a mobile operating system's market share reaches the phase transition point, viruses will pose a serious threat to mobile communications.
D1-2833	 In the intricate tapestry of matter, hydrogen and oxygen, the simplest and most abundant elements, unite to form water, H2O. This seemingly benign compound, vital to life on Earth, is a testament to the transformative power of chemical bonds. When hydrogen and oxygen atoms link, they create a molecule that can flow freely as a liquid, solidize as ice, and vaporize as steam. This versatility is rooted in the polar nature of the water molecule, with its two hydrogen atoms nucleus-hugging and the oxygen atom pulling electrons to one side, making it a solvent capable of dissolving a vast array of substances. In essence, water, the universal solvent, is a fundamental bridge in the realm of chemistry, connecting diverse elements and compounds in a dance of reactions that sustains life and fuels scientific discovery.

In the simulation, the ions interact via the Yukawa potential in a small cell with wrapped boundary conditions. We solve the optical Bloch equation for each ion in the simulation as a function of time. Both the simulation and experiment show the initial Bloch vector rotation, disorder-induced heating, and coherent oscillation of the rms ion velocity. Detailed modeling of the fluorescence signal makes it possible to use fluorescence spectroscopy to probe ion dynamics in ultracold and strongly coupled plasmas.

This adaptability underpins the remarkable diversity of applications for these ubiquitous materials, underscoring the profound impact of polymer chemistry on modern life.
D1-2842	We explore the effects of over-specificity in learning algorithms by investigating the behavior of a student, suited to learn optimally from a teacher $\mathbf{B}$, learning from a teacher $\mathbf{B}'\neq\mathbf{B}$. We only considered the supervised, on-line learning scenario with teachers selected from a particular family. We found that, in the general case, the application of the optimal algorithm to the wrong teacher produces a residual generalization error, even if the right teacher is harder. By imposing mild conditions to the learning algorithm form we obtained an approximation for the residual generalization error. Simulations carried in finite networks validate the estimate found.

The dust charge is obtained from top-view pictures of the crystal using a previously developed analytical model. By assuming a simple force balance, and measuring the radial confining force, the vertical electric field profile in the sheath is reconstructed. The dust crystal is shown to levitate on the plasma side of the Bohm point. Finally, it is shown that the ion drag plays an important role in the vertical force balance, even for large dust grains.

D1-2846	Subjecting a solution of 228Th to ultrasound (20 kHz, 100W), Cardone et al. [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956] claim to observe an increase in the transformation or decay rate of 228Th by a factor of 104. The evidence provided seems however far from conclusive and in part contradictory to the claims made. In fact, looking at the presented data we find it cannot be taken as justification to discard the null hypothesis, namely, that the data from exposed and non exposed samples are drawn from the same distribution. We suggest a number of additional tests that should be made in order to improve the quality of the study and test the hypothesis of so-called piezonuclear reactions.

D1-2850	This paper presents a least mean square (LMS) algorithm for the joint estimation of acoustic and mean flow velocities from laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements. The usual algorithms used for measuring with LDV purely acoustic velocity or mean flow velocity may not be used when the acoustic field is disturbed by a mean flow component. The LMS-based algorithm allows accurate estimations of both acoustic and mean flow velocities. The Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of the associated problem is determined. The variance of the estimators of both acoustic and mean flow velocities is also given. Simulation results of this algorithm are compared with the CRB and the comparison leads to validate this estimator.

D1-2852	We argue that certain assumptions about the process of the emission of the quanta by their (oscillating) emitter provide for their changing (oscillatory) flux at any location. This mechanism underlying (such) wave phenomena is not based, both, on the newtonian notion of force and the field concept (of Faraday, Maxwell, Lorentz and Einstein). When applied to the case of thermal radiation, this emission origin for the wave of quanta is shown here to be consistent with the laws of the black body radiation. We conclude therefore also that a conceptual framework, which is not rooted in the notion of force and in the field concept, may provide a deterministic basis underlying the probabilistic methods of the quantum theory.

They are the building blocks of our modern world, the silent, yet powerful engines driving progress.
D1-2862	Linking the microscopic and macroscopic behavior is at the heart of many natural and social sciences. This apparent similarity conceals essential differences across disciplines: while physical particles are assumed to optimize the global energy, economic agents maximize their own utility. Here, we solve exactly a Schelling-like segregation model, which interpolates continuously between cooperative and individual dynamics. We show that increasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a segregated phase of low utility towards a mixed phase of high utility. By introducing a simple function which links the individual and global levels, we pave the way to a rigorous approach of a wide class of systems, where dynamics is governed by individual strategies.

The amplitude and phase spatial distribution of the flexural modes are directly obtained by Fourier transform of time measurements. We investigate the crossover from real mode to complex-valued quasimode, when absorption is progressively increased on one edge of the wafer. The complexness parameter, which characterizes the degree to which a resonance state is complex-valued, is measured for non-overlapping resonances and is found to be proportional to the non-homogeneous contribution to the line broadening of the resonance. A simple two-level model based on the effective Hamiltonian formalism supports our experimental results.

D1-2870	We present experimental observations of strong electric and magnetic interactions between split ring resonators (SRRs) in metamaterials. We fabricated near-infrared (1.4 $\mu$m) planar metamaterials with different inter-SRR spacings along different directions. Our transmission measurements show blueshifts and redshifts of the magnetic resonance, depending on SRR orientation relative to the lattice. The shifts agree well with a simple model with simultaneous magnetic and electric near-field dipole coupling. We also find large broadening of the resonance, accompanied by a decrease in effective cross section per SRR with increasing density. These effects result from superradiant scattering. Our data shed new light on Lorentz-Lorenz approaches to metamaterials.

In industrial chemistry, nitrogen is used in the production of fertilizers, explosives, and plastics. Interestingly, nitrogen in its pure gaseous state is naturally inert, meaning it doesn't react easily with other elements. However, under certain conditions, it can form compounds like nitric acid and ammonia, which have wide-ranging applications. This versatile element, abundant yet elusive in its reactivity, continues to fascinate chemists worldwide.
D1-2872	In this paper we investigate the properties of self induced transparency (SIT) solitons, propagating in a $\Lambda$-type medium. It was found that the interaction between SIT solitons can lead to trapping with their phase preserved in the ground state coherence of the medium. These phases can be altered in a systematic way by the application of appropriate light fields, such as additional SIT solitons. Furthermore, multiple independent SIT solitons can be made to propagate as bi-solitons through their mutual interaction with a separate light field. Finally, we demonstrate that control of the SIT soliton phase can be used to implement an optical exclusive-or gate.

D1-2874	"The aim of the thesis is to present and analyze two particular problems of transport in porous media flow. The first of them is related to the process of saturation of porous building materials. Recently, M. K\""untz and P. Laval\'ee, using a computer model of this process, have concluded that the anomalous diffusion assumption is correct. In this thesis I present an alternative explanation of this results without any refer to anomalous diffusion. The second part of the thesis covers the numerical analysis of the tortuosity of the flow -- one of a very interesting physical macroscopic variables characterizing transport in porous media. (in Polish)"

Sensitive measurements of the atomic wavefunction and the use of finite-size scaling techniques make it possible to unambiguously demonstrate the existence of a quantum phase transition and to measure its critical exponents. By taking proper account of systematic corrections to one-parameter scaling, we show the universality of the critical exponent $\nu=1.59\pm0.01,$ which is found to be equal to the one previously computed for the Anderson model.

Chemistry, in essence, is the story of transformation—a testament to the power that lies in change.
D1-2878	We propose a new iterative unfolding method for experimental data, making use of a regularization function. The use of this function allows one to build an improved normalization procedure for Monte Carlo spectra, unbiased by the presence of possible new structures in data. We are able to unfold, in a dynamically stable way, data spectra which can be strongly affected by fluctuations in the background subtraction and simultaneously reconstruct structures which were not initially simulated. This method also allows one to control the amount of correlations introduced between the bins of the unfolded spectrum, when the transfers of events correcting the systematic detector effects are performed.

D1-2880	"We study by computer simulation the ""Hawkes process"" that was proposed in a recent paper by Crane and Sornette (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 15649 (2008)) as a plausible model for the dynamics of YouTube video viewing numbers. We test the claims made there that robust identification is possible for classes of dynamic response following activity bursts. Our simulated timeseries for the Hawkes process indeed fall into the different categories predicted by Crane and Sornette. However the Hawkes process gives a much narrower spread of decay exponents than the YouTube data, suggesting limits to the universality of the Hawkes-based analysis."
D1-2881	 Nitrogen, a versatile element, is the key component of our atmosphere, constituting approximately 78% of Earth's air. It's a member of the chalcogen family in the periodic table, but unlike its relatives, it doesn't form stable compounds with other elements unless triple-bonded, as in nitrogen gas (N2). This unique behavior stems from the strong electronegativity of nitrogen atoms, which resist sharing electrons in single or double bonds. However, when bonded with three atoms, as in nitride (N3-) or nitrogen molecules (N=N), the triple bond allows for a stable electronic configuration and the formation of various nitrogen-based compounds essential to life and industry.
D1-2882	Previous formulations of heating and transport associated with strong magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are generalized to incorporate separate internal energy equations for electrons and protons. Electron heat conduction is included. Energy is supplied by turbulent heating that affects both electrons and protons, and is exchanged between them via collisions. Comparison to available Ulysses data shows that a reasonable accounting for the data is provided when (i) the energy exchange timescale is very long and (ii) the deposition of heat due to turbulence is divided, with 60% going to proton heating and 40% into electron heating. Heat conduction, determined here by an empirical fit, plays a major role in describing the electron data.

We propose two specific models, roughly analogous to the fixed edge number and fixed edge probability variants of traditional undirected random graphs. We calculate a number of properties of these models, including particularly the probability of connection between a given pair of vertices, and compare the results with real-world acyclic network data finding that theory and measurements agree surprisingly well -- far better than the often poor agreement of other random graph models with their corresponding real-world networks.

Chemistry, indeed, is the alchemist's art, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.
D1-2886	We consider the spin-exchange in ultracold collisions of hydrogen ($H$) and antihydrogen ($\bar{H}$) atoms. The cross sections for transitions between various hyperfine states are calculated. We show that the process of spin exchange in $\bar{H}-H$ collisions is basically driven by the strong force between proton and antiproton, that spin-exchange cross-sections are proportional to the difference of singlet and triplet strong force S-wave scattering lengths, while the strong force effects are enhanced about $10^9$ times due to long range atomic forces. We show that any difference in hyperfine structure of $H$ and $\bar{H}$ (CPT violation) manifests itself in radical change of spin-exchange cross-sections energy behavior.

Its role in chemical reactions is equally significant as a reactant, a product, or a catalyst. water's influence extends beyond our planet, shaping the conditions necessary for life in the cosmos. In essence, water is not just H2O, but a vital, dynamic, and fundamental substance that binds together the intricate tapestry of chemistry and life.
D1-2888	A novel model of biological organisms is advanced, treating an organism as a self-consistent system subject to a pathogen flux. The principal novelty of the model is that it describes not some parts, but a biological organism as a whole. The organism is modeled by a five-dimensional dynamical system. The organism homeostasis is described by the evolution equations for five interacting components: healthy cells, ill cells, innate immune cells, specific immune cells, and pathogens. The stability analysis demonstrates that, in a wide domain of the parameter space, the system exhibits robust structural stability. There always exist four stable stationary solutions characterizing four qualitatively differing states of the organism: alive state, boundary state, critical state, and dead state.

D1-2890	We present a scheme of XOR/XNOR logic gate, based on non phase-matched noncollinear second harmonic generation from a medium of suitable crystalline symmetry, Gallium nitride. The polarization of the noncollinear generated beam is a function of the polarization of both pump beams, thus we experimentally investigated all possible polarization combinations, evidencing that only some of them are allowed and that the nonlinear interaction of optical signals behaves as a polarization based XOR. The experimental results show the peculiarity of the nonlinear optical response associated with noncollinear excitation, and are explained using the expression for the effective second order optical nonlinearity in noncollinear scheme.

The present model of extended Newtonian dynamics (MEND) is generalize but not alternative to Newtonian Dynamics because its extended Newtonian Dynamics to arbitrary reference frames. It Is Physics of Arbitrary Reference Frames. Generalize and alternative is not the same. MEND describes the dynamics of mechanical systems for arbitrary reference frames and not only for inertial reference frames as Newtonian Dynamics.

Special emphasis is given to the energy dependence of photoexcitation cross-section. The streaked spectra are analyzed within the classical picture of initial time-momentum distribution r_ini(p,t) of photoelectrons mapped to the final energy scale. The actual time-momentum distribution in the absence of the probe laser field is shown to be a poor choice for r_ini, and a more adequate ansatz is suggested.

The influence of elastic and inelastic collisions associated with the large ground state s-wave scattering length of $^{40}$Ca was measured. From these findings, an optimized loading and cooling scheme was developed that allowed us to condense about $2 \cdot 10^4$ atoms after laser cooling in a two-stage magneto-optical trap and subsequent forced evaporation in a crossed dipole trap within less than 3 s. The condensation of an alkaline earth element opens novel opportunities for precision measurements on the narrow intercombination lines as well as investigations of molecular states at the $^1$S--$^3$P asymptotes.

Covalent bonds, formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms, are strong and stable, found in molecules like water and methane. Ionic bonds, resulting from the complete transfer of electrons, bind oppositely charged ions to form crystalline structures such as table salt. Hydrogen bonds, weaker than the former two, occur when a hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to a highly electronegative atom in another, as seen in ice crystals. Understanding these bonds is crucial to comprehending chemistry's fundamental principles, from the behavior of elements to the properties of compounds.
D1-2900	In this work we propose a new approach for the numerical simulation of kinetic equations through Monte Carlo schemes. We introduce a new technique which permits to reduce the variance of particle methods through a matching with a set of suitable macroscopic moment equations. In order to guarantee that the moment equations provide the correct solutions, they are coupled to the kinetic equation through a non equilibrium term. The basic idea, on which the method relies, consists in guiding the particle positions and velocities through moment equations so that the concurrent solution of the moment and kinetic models furnishes the same macroscopic quantities.

Its atmosphere is a complex blend of nitrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons, with a smattering of argon and carbon dioxide. The mystery deepens with the presence of hydrogen cyanide and other organic compounds, hinting at prebiotic chemistry. The cryovolcanism, or liquid methane and ethane eruptions, suggests geological activity akin to Earth. Yet, Titan's exotic chemistry sets it apart, offering a unique laboratory for scientists to study the origins of life beyond our planet.
D1-2902	We develop a simple theoretical framework for the evolution of weighted networks that is consistent with a number of stylized features of real-world data. In our framework, the Barabasi-Albert model of network evolution is extended by assuming that link weights evolve according to a geometric Brownian motion. Our model is verified by means of simulations and real world trade data. We show that the model correctly predicts the intensity and growth distribution of links, the size-variance relationships of the growth of link weights, the relationship between the degree and strength of nodes, as well as the scale-free structure of the network.
D1-2903	 Molecules, the tiny building blocks of matter, are held together by intermolecular forces that dictate their properties and behavior. These forces include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces. Ionic bonds form between oppositely charged ions, creating stable compounds such as table salt (NaCl). Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms, as seen in water (H2O) and methane (CH4). Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to a highly electronegative atom, like nitrogen or oxygen, in another molecule. This bond is weaker than covalent and ionic bonds but plays a crucial role in the structure and properties of biomolecules like DNA and proteins. Van der Waals forces, the weakest of the intermolecular forces, act between all molecules due to instantaneous electric dipole moments, affecting the shape, boiling point, and melting point of substances. Understanding these forces helps chemists predict and control the properties of materials at the molecular level.
D1-2904	We analyze deficiencies of commonly used Coulomb approximations in Generalized Born solvation energy calculation models and report a development of a new fast surface-based method (FSBE) for numerical calculations of the solvation energy of biomolecules with charged groups. The procedure is only a few percents wrong for molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, provides explicit values for the reaction field potential at any point of the molecular interior, water polarization at the surface of the molecule, both the solvation energy value and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies contributions to a molecular complex formation.
D1-2905	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, interact through various forces to form compounds. A compound's composition is constant, consisting of two or more elements combined in a fixed ratio. For example, water (H2O) is a compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Chemical reactions, which are essentially rearrangements of atoms to form new compounds, drive the world around us.

D1-2907	 Unraveling the wonders of chemistry, we delve into the realm of acids and bases. A hydrogen ion donor, an acid weakens as its conjugate base strengthens, while a base, a hydrogen ion acceptor, becomes stronger as its conjugate acid weakens. This interplay between acids and bases governs pH, a crucial factor in various chemical reactions, biological processes, and everyday phenomena such as the fizz of a carbonated drink or the bitterness of lemon juice. Understanding this dynamic duo expands our perception of the world, shedding light on the intricate dance of protons in matter.

One mechanism that can affect the estimation of the coefficients is geometric projection effects. For some biologically-inspired examples, these effects are predicted and explored with a non-stochastic projection operator method, and compared with direct numerical simulation of the systems' Langevin equations. General features and characteristics are identified, and the utility of the Kramers-Moyal method discussed. Projections of a system are in general non-Markovian, but here the Kramers-Moyal method remains useful, and in any case the primary examples considered are found to be close to Markovian.
D1-2911	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are fascinating structures that exhibit intricate relationships. They consist of atoms, bound together by electromagnetic forces, specifically electrovalent, covalent, or ionic bonds. Each molecule's properties, such as boiling point, melting point, solubility, and reactivity, are influenced by these bonds, the arrangement of atoms, and the presence of functional groups. For instance, water (H2O) is a polar molecule due to the uneven distribution of electrons, making it a solvent for many substances. Conversely, carbon dioxide (CO2) is nonpolar, contributing to its solubility in nonpolar solvents. Understanding these properties is crucial for various applications, ranging from pharmaceuticals to climate science. Molecules' behavior, whether in isolation or as part of a compound, continues to be a captivating realm of study in chemistry.
D1-2912	Network motifs are small building blocks of complex networks. Statistically significant motifs often perform network-specific functions. However, the precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global structure and function of networks remains elusive. Here we show that the global structure of some real networks is statistically determined by the probability of connections within motifs of size at most 3, once this probability accounts for node degrees. The connectivity profiles of node triples in these networks capture all their local and global properties. This finding impacts methods relying on motif statistical significance, and enriches our understanding of the elementary forces that shape the structure of complex networks.
D1-2913	 Molecules, the tiny building blocks of matter, are the fundamental units of chemistry. They are composed of atoms, which are in turn made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

These bonds can be covalent, ionic, or metallic, each type exhibiting unique properties due to the nature of the electron sharing or transfer. The study of these interactions, their properties, and their reactions form the backbone of chemistry, offering insights into the world around us at the most basic level.
D1-2914	We discuss the properties of the transmission function in the k-space for a generic multi-layered structure. In particular we analytically demonstrate that a transmission greater than one in the evanescent spectrum (amplification of the evanescent modes) can be directly linked to the guided modes supported by the structure. Moreover we show that the slope of the phase of the transmission function in the propagating spectrum is inversely proportional to the ability of the structure to compensate the diffraction of the propagating modes. We apply these findings to discuss several examples where super-resolution is achieved thanks to the simultaneous availability of the amplification of the evanescent modes and the diffraction compensation of the propagating modes.
D1-2915	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are held together by various intermolecular forces. Ionic bonds, where electrons are completely transferred, bind ions of opposite charges, forming crystalline structures. Covalent bonds, sharing of electrons between atoms, create stable molecules like water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). Hydrogen bonds, attraction between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another electronegative atom, occur in polar molecules, lowering their boiling points. Van der Waals forces, weak attractive interactions between all molecules, contribute to the cohesion of nonpolar substances. Understanding these forces aids in predicting chemical behavior and developing new materials.
D1-2916	The interaction between the field emission resonance states and the photodetached electron in an electric field is studied by semiclassical theory. An analytical expression of the photodetachment cross section is derived in the framework. It is found that the Stark shifted image state modulates the photodetachment cross section by adding irregular staircase or smooth oscillation in the spectrum. When the photodetached electron is trapped in Stark shifted image potential well, the detachment spectrum displays an irregular staircase structure which corresponds to the modified Rydberg series. While the photodetached electron is not bound by the surface potential well, the cross secton contains only a smooth oscillation due to the reflection of electronic wave by the field or the surface.
D1-2917	 Molecules, the tiny particles that make up matter, are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry. They consist of atoms bonded together, with the number and type of bonds determining their structure and properties. For instance, a water molecule (H2O) has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, bonded in a specific arrangement that gives it unique properties such as its ability to dissolve many substances and its role as a universal solvent. These properties arise from the electrons shared between the atoms, which create a polar dipole moment in the molecule. This polarization allows water to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules, leading to its high boiling point and surface tension, among other intriguing characteristics.

The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies of molecular complex formation.

In it, I reminisce about the early development of effective field theories of the strong interactions, comment briefly on some other applications of effective field theories, and then take up the idea that the Standard Model and General Relativity are the leading terms in an effective field theory. Finally, I cite recent calculations that suggest that the effective field theory of gravitation and matter is asymptotically safe.
D1-2921	 Molecules, the tiny building blocks of matter, are held together by various types of chemical bonds. Ionic bonds, for instance, occur when one atom loses electrons and another gains them, creating a positively charged ion and a negatively charged one, which then attract and bind together. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, result from the sharing of electrons between atoms, such as in water (H2O), where each hydrogen atom shares an electron with one oxygen atom. Hydrogen bonds, weaker than the previous two, occur when a hydrogen atom in a polar molecule is attracted to a nearby electronegative atom. These interactions govern the properties of substances, determining their solubility, melting points, boiling points, and more, making them essential to our understanding of chemistry and the world around us.

Moreover, it provides useful insight into the cluster geometry and chemically active sites on the cluster surface, which can help to design better catalytic processes.
D1-2925	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are intricately bonded together in various ways, forming complex structures. Covalent bonds, defined by shared electrons, create stable compounds like water (H2O) and hydrogen chloride (HCl). Ionic bonds, on the other hand, result from the transfer of electrons between atoms, as seen in sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). These bonds dictate a molecule's properties, such as melting point, boiling point, and solubility.

Molecules, in turn, are made up of atoms bonded together. These bonds can be ionic, covalent, or metallic, each exhibiting unique properties. Ionic bonds occur between metal and non-metal atoms, resulting in the complete transfer of electrons. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, share electrons between atoms. Metallic bonds are found in metals, where electrons are shared among many atoms. These various bond types determine a molecule's structure, behavior, and reactivity. Understanding such interactions is crucial in the realm of chemical reactions and compound formation.
D1-2928	An approach to correlated dynamics of quantum nuclei and electrons both in dynamical interaction with external environments is presented. This stochastic quantum molecular dynamics rests on a theorem that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the total ensemble-averaged current density of interacting nuclei and electrons and a given external vector potential. The theory allows for a first-principles description of phenomena previously inaccessible via standard quantum molecular dynamics such as electronic and nuclear relaxation in photochemistry, dissipative correlated electron-ion dynamics in intense laser fields, nuclear dephasing, etc. As a demonstration of the approach, we discuss the rotational relaxation of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzonitrile in a uniform bath in the limit of classical nuclei.

Nonperturbative solution of the problem yields analytical expressions for PA linewidth and shift which are applicable for arbitrary PA laser intensity and magnetic field tuning of Feshbach Resonance. We show that by tuning magnetic field close to Fano minimum, it is possible to suppress power broadening at increased laser intensities. This occurs due to quantum interference of PA transitions from unperturbed and perturbed continuum. Line narrowing at high laser intensities is accompanied by large spectral shifts. We briefly discuss important consequences of line narrowing in cold collisions.

First simulation deals with the so-called Heider balance where initial purely random preferences split the community into two mutually hostile groups. Second simulation shows that once these groups are formed, the cooperation between them is going to fail. Third simulation provides a numerical illustration of the process of biased learning. the model indicates that lack of objective information is a barrier to new information. Fourth simulation shows that in the presence of a strong conflict between communities hate is unavoidable.
D1-2935	 Molecules, the tiny building blocks of matter, are held together by intermolecular forces. These forces, such as ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and van der Waals forces, determine a substance's physical properties. For instance, ionic compounds, like table salt (sodium chloride), possess strong ionic bonds, resulting in high melting and boiling points. On the other hand, covalent compounds, like water (H2O), exhibit weaker intermolecular forces, leading to lower melting and boiling points and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Understanding intermolecular forces is crucial for predicting chemical behavior and developing new materials.

Indeed, chemistry, the silent alchemist, paints the canvas of our universe.
D1-2940	Conventional descriptions of transverse waves in an elastic solid are limited by an assumption of infinitesimally small gradients of rotation. By assuming a linear response to variations in orientation, we derive an exact description of a restricted class of rotational waves in an ideal isotropic elastic solid. The result is a nonlinear equation expressed in terms of Dirac bispinors. This result provides a simple classical interpretation of relativistic quantum mechanical dynamics. We construct a Lagrangian of the form L=-E+U+K=0, where E is the total energy, U is the potential energy, and K is the kinetic energy.
D1-2941	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are constantly interacting through various forces. Attraction between opposite charges, known as electrostatic forces, and the sharing or transfer of electrons, resulting in covalent and ionic bonds, are prime examples. These bonds create compounds, each with unique properties that determine their behavior in chemical reactions. For instance, water, a crucial compound, is composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom via covalent bonds, enabling its role as a solvent and its involvement in numerous chemical reactions. Similarly, sodium chloride, an ionic compound, dissolves in water to form ions, which, in turn, greatly influence the properties of solutions. Thus, the nature of these interactions and resulting bond formation significantly impacts the world around us.
D1-2942	We derive the nonlinear equations satisfied by the coefficients of linear combinations that maximize their skewness when their variance is constrained to take a specific value. In order to numerically solve these nonlinear equations we develop a gradient-type flow that preserves the constraint. In combination with the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition this leads to a set of orthogonal modes with maximal skewness. For illustration purposes we apply these techniques to atmospheric data. in this case the maximal-skewness modes correspond to strongly localized atmospheric flows. We show how these ideas can be extended, for example to maximal-flatness modes.

D1-2952	The dependence of DNA assemblies conductance on relative humidity is investigated theoretically. Following earlier suggestions, we consider the ionic conductivity through the layers of water adsorbed by DNA molecules. The increase in humidity results in a growing water layer. The binding energy of ions depends on the thickness of the water layer due to change in water polarization. This dependence is very strong at smaller thicknesses of water layers due to the low-dimensional confinement of an electric field in water. We show that the associated change in ion concentration can explain the six orders of magnitude increase in conductivity, with relative humidity growing from 0.05 to 0.95

Similarly, oxygen and hydrogen, when combined under the right conditions, produce water, a reaction crucial for life on Earth. Each reaction, a testament to the ceaseless transformation and interconnectedness of the elements, reveals the intricate, dynamic symphony of chemistry.
D1-2954	We use agent-based modeling to investigate the effect of conservatism and partisanship on the efficiency with which large populations solve the density classification task--a paradigmatic problem for information aggregation and consensus building. We find that conservative agents enhance the populations' ability to efficiently solve the density classification task despite large levels of noise in the system. In contrast, we find that the presence of even a small fraction of partisans holding the minority position will result in deadlock or a consensus on an incorrect answer. Our results provide a possible explanation for the emergence of conservatism and suggest that even low levels of partisanship can lead to significant social costs.

D1-2956	In this manuscript we introduce a generalisation of the log-Normal distribution that is inspired by a modification of the Kaypten multiplicative process using the $q$-product of Borges [Physica A \textbf{340}, 95 (2004)]. Depending on the value of q the distribution increases the tail for small (when $q<1$) or large (when $q>1$) values of the variable upon analysis. The usual log-Normal distribution is retrieved when $q=1$. The main statistical features of this distribution are presented as well as a related random number generators and tables of quantiles of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Lastly, we illustrate the application of this distribution studying the adjustment of a set of variables of biological and financial origin.
D1-2957	 Molecules, the fundamental units of matter, are the building blocks of elements and compounds in chemistry. They are composed of atoms, which in turn are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The arrangement, number, and type of atoms in a molecule determine its identity and properties. A covalent bond, a stable attraction between atoms due to the sharing of electrons, holds atoms together within a molecule. Ionic bonds, on the other hand, are formed when electrons are transferred between atoms, creating oppositely charged ions that attract each other. These bonds are critical in the formation of ionic compounds. Understanding the nature of these bonds and molecular structures provides essential insights into the behavior, reactions, and interactions of matter in the chemical world.
D1-2958	We report on hyperfine-resolved spectroscopic measurements of the electric-dipole forbidden 5$p_{3/2} \to 8p_{1/2}$ transition in a sample of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms. The hyperfine selection rules enable the weak magnetic-dipole (M1) contribution to the transition strength to be distinguished from the much stronger electric-quadrupole (E2) contribution. An upper limit on the M1 transition strength is determined that is about 50 times smaller than an earlier experimental determination. We also calculate the expected value of the M1 matrix element and find that it is less than the upper limit extracted from the experiment.

D1-2960	Based on the transformation optics, a novel transmission-line (TL) approach to realize invisibility cloaking using planar anisotropic metamaterials (MTMs) is proposed. The two-dimensional cylindrical cloaks are modeled based on inductor-capacitor (L-C) MTMs networks. The three elements of the constitutive parameters are all allowed to be spatially inhomogeneous which lead to the full parameter realization of a cylindrical cloak. As an example, a cloak working at VHF band is modeled and its invisibility behavior is demonstrated based on the solution of the node voltage distribution. Due to the non-resonant properties of the L-C elements, the broadband characteristic of the proposed cloaks is also evident.
D1-2961	 Titan's Mystery: Hydrocarbon Lakes and Methane SeasNestled within the frigid, methane-rich atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan, lie vast seas and intricate networks of hydrocarbon lakes. These bodies of liquid, unlike Earth's oceans, are composed primarily of ethane and methane, with traces of other complex hydrocarbons. The lakes, which resemble Earth's oil fields, are formed from the slow condensation of these gases due to Titan's low temperatures.The origin of these hydrocarbons is still a subject of scientific debate. Some theories suggest that they are the remnants of primordial ice, while others propose that they are synthesized through the action of sunlight and trace chemicals present in Titan's atmosphere. Regardless, these lakes and seas offer a unique opportunity to study the chemistry of a world far removed from our own, offering insights into the potential for life in extreme environments.
D1-2962	We present a novel approach to reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling, SpecSwap-RMC, which makes use of pre-computed property data from a discrete configuration space replacing atomistic moves with swap moves of contributions to a sample-set representing the average, or summed property. The approach is particularly suitable for disordered systems and properties which require significant computer time to compute. We demonstrate the approach by fitting jointly and separately the EXAFS signal and x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of ice Ih using as SpecSwap sample-set 80 configurations from a space of 1382 local structures with associated pre-computed spectra. As an additional demonstration we compare SpecSwap and FEFFIT fits of EXAFS data on crystalline copper finding excellent agreement.
D1-2963	 Titan's intriguing hydrocarbon lakes, a unique phenomenon on Saturn's largest moon, mirror the intrigue of chemistry on Earth. Liquid methane and ethane, under the intense cold (-179 degrees Celsius), mimic oil and water on our planet. The lakes, as observed by NASA's Cassini mission, show methane seas, dunes, and rain, a testament to complex chemical processes. These alien bodies of liquid offer a glimpse into the vast possibilities of chemical systems beyond Earth, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of chemistry and life beyond our world.
D1-2964	"Spin relaxation due to atom-atom collisions is measured for magnetically trapped erbium and thulium atoms at a temperature near 500 mK. The rate constants for Er-Er and Tm-Tm collisions are 3.0 times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1 and 1.1 times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1, respectively, 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than those observed for highly magnetic S-state atoms. This is strong evidence for an additional, dominant, spin relaxation mechanism, electrostatic anisotropy, in collisions between these ""submerged-shell"" L > 0 atoms. These large spin relaxation rates imply that evaporative cooling of these atoms in a magnetic trap will be highly inefficient."

D1-2966	Shear-induced cross-correlations of particle fluctuations perpendicular and along stream-lines are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Direct measurements of the Brownian motion of micron-sized beads, held by optical tweezers in a shear-flow cell, show a strong time-asymmetry in the cross-correlation, which is caused by the non-normal amplification of fluctuations. Complementary measurements on the single particle probability distribution substantiate this behavior and both results are consistent with a Langevin model. In addition, a shear-induced anti-correlation between orthogonal random-displacements of two trapped and hydrodynamically interacting particles is detected, having one or two extrema in time, depending on the positions of the particles.

D1-2970	It is pointed out that relativistic classical electron theory with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation has a scaling symmetry which is suitable for understanding the equilibrium behavior of classical thermal radiation at a spectrum other than the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. In relativistic classical electron theory, the masses of the particles are the only scale-giving parameters associated with mechanics while the action-angle variables are scale invariant. The theory thus separates the interaction of the action variables of matter and radiation from the scale-giving parameters. Classical zero-point radiation is invariant under scattering by the charged particles of relativistic classical electron theory. The basic ideas of the matter -radiation interaction are illustrated in a simple relativistic classical electromagnetic example.

A low energy detection threshold is essential for a sensitive WIMP search. The understanding of the relative scintillation efficiency (Leff) and ionization yield of low energy nuclear recoils in LXe is limited for energies below 10 keV. In this paper, we present new measurements that extend the energy down to 4 keV, finding that Leff decreases with decreasing energy. We also measure the quenching of scintillation efficiency due to the electric field in LXe, finding no significant field dependence.

For instance, hydrogen, a flammable gas, merges with oxygen, another reactive gas, to form water, a liquid essential for life. The formation of a compound is typically irreversible under standard conditions, a phenomenon known as a chemical reaction. These reactions, governed by the laws of thermodynamics, drive the transformation of matter and energy in our world, shaping our understanding of the universe's complexity.
D1-2974	The study is motivated by recent findings of the decrease in the momentum transfer from strong winds to sea. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a three-fluid system of air, foam and water is examined within the range of intermediately short surface waves. The foam layer thickness necessary for effective separation of the atmosphere and the ocean is estimated. Due to high density contrasts in the three-fluid system, even a relatively thin foam layer between the atmosphere and the ocean can provide a significant stabilization of the water surface by the wavelength shift of the instability towards smaller scales. It is conjectured that such stabilization qualitatively explains the observed reduction of roughness and drag.

The problem consists in the identification of a non-linear source in the 2D Grad-Shafranov equation, which governs the axisymmetric equilibrium of a plasma in a Tokamak. The experimental measurements that enable this identification are the magnetics on the vacuum vessel, but also polarimetric and interferometric measures on several chords, as well as motional Stark effect or pressure measurements.

D1-2982	In this article, we study transportation network in Minnesota. We show that the system is characterized by Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling with nontrivial values of the scaling exponent. We also show that the characteristic exponent does not unequivocally characterize a given road network, as it may differ within the same network if one takes into account location of observation points, season, period of day, or traffic intensity. The results are set against Taylor's fluctuation scaling in the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model for traffic. It is shown that Taylor's law may serve, beside the fundamental diagram, as an indicator of different traffic phases (free flow, traffic jam etc.).
D1-2983	 In the realm of chemical science, the study of catalysts plays a pivotal role. These substances, often metals or enzymes, significantly speed up chemical reactions without undergoing permanent change themselves. They work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction, essentially acting as a bridge between reactants and products. This acceleration, in turn, increases the efficiency of industrial processes, such as the production of fertilizers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, catalysts contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing energy consumption and minimizing harmful by-products. Indeed, the judicious use of catalysts promises a greener, more efficient future for chemical manufacturing.

Here quantum entanglement (Schrodinger cat effect) between photon and photon trajectories detector (which includes two same simple two-level systems) is studied. It admits a consistent model of the detection or measurement procedure. Concretely here (self-)collapse at detector is consistently treated as the spontaneous (non-dynamical) breaking (effective hiding) of the unitary symmetry (superposition or entanglement) of quantum mechanical dynamics. It can be considered as an especial case of the general formalism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking.

D1-2986	An oscillating electric field at 1.356 GHz was used to promote the resonant energy transfer process: $43d_{5/2}+43d_{5/2} \to 45p_{3/2}+41f$ between translationally cold $^{85}$Rb Rydberg atoms. The ac Stark shifts due to this dressing field created degeneracies between the initial and final two-atom states of this process. The ac field strength was scanned to collect spectra which are analogous to dc electric-field-induced resonant energy transfer spectra. Different resonances were observed for different magnetic sublevels involved in the process. Compared to earlier work performed at higher frequencies, the choice of dressing frequency and structure of the spectra may be intuitively understood, by analogy with the dc field case.
D1-2987	 In the realm of chemistry, the intriguing compound known as water (H2O) stands out. It's a universal solvent, dissolving more substances than any other liquid. This unique property, coupled with its ubiquity in life, makes water a fundamental element in chemistry and biology. Water's polarity, arising from the uneven distribution of electrons between hydrogen and oxygen atoms, creates hydrogen bonds, enabling a water molecule to surround and interact with other polar molecules, facilitating solutions. Additionally, water's ability to expand upon freezing—a phenomenon known as hydrophoric expansion—helps prevent the formation of ice on the surface, maintaining liquid water in aquatic environments below freezing points. This characteristic, along with water's role in chemical reactions as a medium, a reactant, or a product, further underscores its indispensable role in nature and laboratory settings alike.

D1-2990	We formulate the Born approximation for finding resonance poles in the complex plane for potential scattering problems. Using the method, we study the distribution of resonance poles for several scattering potentials. In particular, we find for an exponential potential with a cutoff that the cutoff generates an infinite series of extra resonance poles below and along the real axis, which would not exist without the cutoff. We also find for a Gaussian potential that the series of resonance poles approach the imaginary axis of the complex energy plane from left. In other words, the real parts of the resonant eigenenergis are all negative.

These asymptotic states represent a small subset in the space of functions and are characterised by properties that are difficult to identify in a direct approach. The field theoretical approach to the dynamics and to the asymptotic states of fluids and plasmas in 2D provides a considerable extension of the usual perspective. The present works discusses a series of consequences of the field theoretical approach, when it is applied to particular problems.

On a more personal level, they also facilitate the breakdown of pollutants, contributing to cleaner air and water. The study and application of catalysts continue to expand, promising a greener, more efficient future.
D1-2994	It has long been surmised that the mean-velocity profile (MVP) of a pipe flow is closely related to the spectrum of turbulent energy. Here we perform a spectral analysis to identify the eddies that dominate the production of shear stress via momentum transfer. This analysis allows us to express the MVP as a functional of the spectrum. Each part of the MVP relates to a specific spectral range: the buffer layer to the dissipative range, the log layer to the inertial range, and the wake to the energetic range. The parameters of the spectrum set the thickness of the viscous layer, the amplitude of the buffer layer, and the amplitude of the wake.
D1-2995	 In the realm of chemistry, hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in the behavior and properties of numerous substances. These bonds, weaker than covalent or ionic bonds, are formed between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative element and a lone pair of electrons on an adjacent atom. They are responsible for the intriguing properties observed in water, such as its high boiling point and surface tension, and they influence the crystalline structure and melting points of many organic compounds. Moreover, hydrogen bonds are integral to the stabilization of double helices in DNA, underscoring their significance in biological systems. The study of hydrogen bonds continues to deepen our understanding of various phenomena in chemistry and biology.
D1-2996	Due to the breaking of gauge symmetry in rotating superfluid Helium, the inertial mass of a vortex diverges with the vortex size. The vortex inertial mass is thus much higher than the classical inertial mass of the vortex core. An equal increase of the vortex gravitational mass is questioned. The possibility that the vortices in a rotating superfluid could break the weak equivalence principle in relation with a variable speed of light in the superfluid vacuum is debated. Experiments to test this possibility are investigated on the bases that superfluid Helium vortices would not fall, under the single influence of a uniform gravitational field, at the same rate as the rest of the superfluid Helium mass.
D1-2997	 In the realm of chemistry, the intriguing concept of electrolysis captivates many. This process, harnessing the power of electricity, splits compounds into fundamental elements. It operates by passing an electric current through a ionic compound immersed in a suitable solvent, typically water. The positively charged ions (cations) migrate towards the negatively charged electrode, while the negatively charged ions (anions) move toward the positive one. This movement results in a chemical reaction, with water molecules breaking down at the electrodes, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases respectively. The efficiency of electrolysis depends on various factors, including the voltage, current density, and nature of the electrodes. A testament to the versatility of chemistry, electrolysis not only illuminates fundamental principles, but also offers practical applications, such as industrial production of hydrogen and purification of water.

The calculations are accomplished using a non-reactive close-coupling quantum-mechanical approach. The H$_2$ molecule is treated as a rigid rotor. The total elastic scattering cross section $\sigma_{el}(\epsilon)$ at energy $\epsilon$, state-resolved rotational transition cross sections $\sigma_{jj'}(\epsilon)$ between states $j$ and $j'$ and corresponding thermal rate coefficients $k_{jj'}(T)$ are computed in the temperature range 0.004 K $ \lesssim T \lesssim$ 4 K. Satisfactory agreement with other calculations (variational) has been obtained for $\sigma_{el}(\epsilon)$.
D1-2999	 In the realm of chemistry, hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role. These intermolecular forces, weaker than covalent bonds but stronger than van der Waals forces, are essential in the structural integrity and properties of numerous compounds. Hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom in a molecule is bound to a highly electronegative element, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, and is attracted to a lone pair of electrons on another highly electronegative atom in a nearby molecule. This interaction influences the melting and boiling points, solubility, and crystal structure of substances, making it a crucial factor in the behavior and characteristics of various chemical compounds.
D1-3000	This paper offers a study of oxygen dissolution into a solid, and its consequences on the mechanical behaviour of the material. In fact, mechanical strains strongly influence the oxidation processes and may be, in some materials, responsible for cracking. To realize this study, mechanical considerations are introduced into the classical diffusion laws. Simulations were made for the particular case of uranium dioxide, which undergoes the chemical fragmentation. According to our simulations, the hypothesis of a compression stress field into the oxidised UO2 compound near the internal interface is consistent with some oxidation mechanisms of oxidation experimentally observed. More generally, this work will be extended to the simulation to an oxide layer growth on a metallic substrate.
